1180145_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	We were incorporated as Replidyne, Inc. in Delaware in 2000.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	On February 25, 2009, Replidyne, Inc. completed its business combination with Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., a Minnesota corporation ( CSI-MN ), in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of November 3, 2008, by and among Replidyne, Responder Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Replidyne ( Merger Sub ), and CSI-MN (the Merger Agreement ).
1180145_11_ITEM1_P2_S2	Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into CSI-MN, with CSI-MN continuing after the merger as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Replidyne.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P2_S3	At the effective time of the merger, Replidyne changed its name to Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. ( CSI ) and CSI-MN changed its name to CSI Minnesota, Inc.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P2_S4	As of immediately following the effective time of the merger, former CSI-MN stockholders owned approximately 80.2% of the outstanding common stock of the combined company, and Replidyne stockholders owned approximately 19.8% of the outstanding common stock of the combined company.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Following the merger of Merger Sub with CSI-MN, CSI-MN merged with and into CSI, with CSI continuing after the merger as the surviving corporation.

1180145_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	We are a medical device company focused on developing and commercializing minimally invasive treatment solutions for vascular disease.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	Interventional endovascular treatment of peripheral artery disease, or PAD, is our initial area of focus.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	PAD is caused by the accumulation of plaque in peripheral arteries, most commonly occurring in the pelvis and legs.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P8_S3	PAD is a progressive disease, and, if left untreated, can lead to limb amputation or death.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our primary products, the Diamondback 360 PAD System ( Diamondback 360 ), Diamondback Predator 360 PAD System ( Predator 360 ) and Stealth 360 PAD System ( Stealth 360 ), are catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of plaque types in leg arteries both above and below the knee and address many of the limitations associated with existing treatment alternatives.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	We refer to the Diamondback 360 , the Predator 360 and the Stealth 360 collectively in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the PAD Systems.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	In August 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted us 510(k) clearance for the use of the Diamondback 360 as a therapy in patients with PAD.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	We commenced a limited commercial introduction of the Diamondback 360 in the United States in September 2007 and began a full commercial launch during the quarter ended March 31, 2008.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P10_S2	We received 510(k) clearance of the Predator 360 in March 2009 and commenced commercial launch in April 2009.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P10_S3	We received 510(k) clearance of the Stealth 360 in March 2011 and commenced a limited market release that same month.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P10_S4	We expect to continue this limited release through the first quarter of fiscal 2012, ending September 30, 2011, after which we plan to begin a broader commercial launch.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P10_S5	As of June 30, 2011, the PAD Systems had been utilized in more than 50,000 procedures.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P10_S6	We intend to leverage the capabilities of the PAD Systems to expand into the interventional coronary market though we need to complete certain clinical trials and receive FDA approval to do so.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P10_S7	In May 2011, we received approval from the FDA to complete enrollment of 429 patients in our ORBIT II clinical trial for a coronary application for the Diamondback 360 , which followed the FDA s review of data from the first 50 cases in the ORBIT II trial.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P10_S8	In addition to the PAD Systems, we are expanding our product portfolio through internal product development and establishment of business relationships with other medical device companies.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P10_S9	We now offer multiple accessory products designed to complement the use of the PAD Systems, and we have entered into a distribution agreement with Asahi Intecc Co., Ltd. to market its peripheral guidewire line in the United States.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	Market Overview Peripheral Artery Disease PAD is a circulatory problem in which plaque deposits build up on the walls of the arteries, reducing blood flow to the limbs.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	The most common early symptoms of PAD are pain, cramping or fatigue in the leg or hip muscles while walking.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	Symptoms may progress to include numbness, tingling or weakness in the leg and, in severe cases, burning or aching pain in the leg, foot or toes while resting.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P12_S2	As PAD progresses, additional signs and symptoms occur, including cooling or color changes in the skin of the legs or feet, and sores on the legs or feet that do not heal.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	If untreated, PAD may lead to critical limb ischemia, a condition in which the amount of oxygenated blood being delivered to the limb is insufficient to keep the tissue alive.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	Critical limb ischemia often leads to large non-healing ulcers, infections, gangrene and, eventually, limb amputation or death.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	PAD affects approximately eight to 12 million people in the United States, as cited by the authors of the PARTNERS study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2001.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	12% to 20% of the population over 65 years old.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	An aging population, coupled with increasing incidence of diabetes and obesity, is likely to increase the prevalence of PAD.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	In many older PAD patients, particularly those with diabetes, PAD is characterized by fibrotic (moderately hard) or calcified (extremely hard) plaque deposits that have not been successfully treated with existing non-invasive treatment techniques.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	PAD may involve arteries throughout the leg.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	Arteries above the knee are generally long, straight and relatively wide, while arteries below the knee are shorter and branch into arteries that are progressively smaller in diameter.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	Despite the severity of PAD, it remains relatively underdiagnosed.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	According to an article published in Podiatry Today in 2006, only approximately 2.5 million of the eight to 12 million people in the United States with PAD are diagnosed.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	Although we believe the rate of diagnosis of PAD is increasing, underdiagnosis continues due to patients failing to display symptoms or physicians misinterpreting symptoms as normal aging.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P18_S3	Recent emphasis on PAD education from medical associations, insurance companies and other groups, coupled with publications in medical journals, is increasing physician and patient awareness of PAD risk factors, symptoms and treatment options.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P18_S4	The PARTNERS study advocated increased PAD screening by primary care physicians.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	Physicians treat a significant portion of the 2.5 million people in the United States who are diagnosed with PAD using medical management, which includes lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise and drug treatment.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	For instance, within a reference group of more than 1,000 patients from the PARTNERS study, 54% of the patients with a prior diagnosis of PAD were receiving antiplatelet medication treatment.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	While medications, diet and exercise may improve blood flow, they do not treat the underlying obstruction and many patients have difficulty maintaining lifestyle changes.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	Additionally, many prescribed medications are contraindicated, or inadvisable, for patients with heart disease, which often exists in PAD patients.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	As a result of these challenges, many medically managed patients develop more severe symptoms that require procedural intervention.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	Coronary Artery Disease Based on data from the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, and the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, we estimate that approximately 924,000 percutaneous coronary interventions, or PCI, procedures occurred in the United States in 2009.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	Based on various studies, we believe that more than 25% of PCI procedures involve moderate to severe levels of calcified coronary arteries and could benefit from the use of our device.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P21_S2	In addition, based on AHRQ data, we estimate that in 2009 approximately 478,000 coronary artery bypass graft surgeries were performed in the United States.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P21_S3	These patients generally have higher rates of calcification and we believe they could benefit from the use of our device.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	The PAD Systems each use a single-use, low-profile catheter that travels over our proprietary ViperWire Advance Guide Wire and is powered by either an external control unit (Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 ) or a saline infusion pump (Stealth 360 ).
1180145_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	a sheath, which covers the drive shaft and permits delivery of saline or medications to the treatment area.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	The ViperWire Advance is the second generation of the ViperWire.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	The ViperWire Advance was designed to offer an improved ability to maneuver through tortuous, twisting blood vessels and cross challenging lesions.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	The PAD Systems travel over this wire to the lesion and operate on this wire.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	ViperSlide is an exclusive lubricant designed to optimize the smooth operation of the PAD Systems.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	On April 4, 2011, we entered into a five-year supply agreement with Fresenius Kabi AB ( Fresenius ), pursuant to which Fresenius will manufacture and serve as a single-source supplier of the ViperSlide lubricant through March 2016.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	Used in conjunction with the Diamondback 360 and Predator 360 PAD Systems, the control unit incorporates a touch-screen interface on an easily maneuverable, lightweight pole.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	Using an external air supply, the control unit regulates air pressure to drive the turbine located in the catheter handle to speeds ranging up to 200,000 revolutions per minute.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	Saline, delivered by a pumping mechanism on the control unit, bathes the device shaft and crown.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P27_S3	The constant flow of saline reduces the risk of heat generation.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	Used exclusively with the Stealth 360 , the saline infusion pump mounts directly to the intravenous pole and bathes the devices shaft and crown and provides a power supply for the operation of the catheter.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	The two technologies used in the PAD Systems are plaque modification through differential sanding and plaque removal.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	The PAD Systems were designed to allow the devices to differentiate between soft compliant and harder diseased arterial tissue.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	This property is consistent with sanding material such as the diamond grit used in the PAD Systems.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P30_S2	The diamond preferentially engages and sands harder material.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P30_S3	The PAD Systems also treat soft plaque, which is still harder than a normal vessel wall.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	Arterial lesions tend to be harder and stiffer than compliant, undiseased tissue, and they often are fibrotic or calcified.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	The PAD Systems sand the lesion but are designed not to damage more compliant parts of the artery.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	The mechanism is a function of the centrifugal force generated by the PAD Systems as they rotate.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P31_S3	As the crown moves outward, the centrifugal force is offset by the counterforce exerted by the arterial wall.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P31_S4	If the tissue is compliant, it should flex away, rather than generating an opposing force that would allow the PAD Systems to engage and sand the wall.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P31_S5	Diseased tissue provides resistance and is able to generate an opposing force that allows the PAD Systems to engage and sand the plaque.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P31_S6	The sanded plaque is broken down into particles generally smaller than circulating red blood cells that are washed away downstream with the patient s natural blood flow.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	Of 36 consecutive experiments that we performed in carbon blocks, animal and cadaver models:
1180145_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	99.3% of particles were smaller than the lumen of the capillaries (which provide the connection between the arterial and venous system), with a 99% confidence interval.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	The small particle size minimizes the risk of vascular bed overload, or a saturation of the peripheral vessels with large particles, which may cause slow or reduced blood flow to the foot.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P33_S2	We believe that the small size of the particles also allows them to be managed by the body s natural cleansing of the blood, whereby various types of white blood cells eliminate worn-out cells and other debris in the bloodstream.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P33_S3	The systems operate on the principles of centrifugal force.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	As the speed of the crown s rotation increases, it creates centrifugal force, which increases the crown s orbit and presses the diamond grit coated offset crown against the lesion or plaque, removing a small amount of plaque with each orbit.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	Normal arteries are compliant; they have the ability to expand and contract as needed to supply blood flow to the legs and feet.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	Arteries burdened with fibrotic (moderately hard) and/or calcified (extremely hard) plaque often lose their compliance, which makes other therapies such as angioplasty, stenting, surgical bypass and atherectomy problematic.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	The characteristics of the orbit and the resulting lumen size can be adjusted by modifying three variables:
1180145_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	An increase in speed creates a larger lumen.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our current systems allow the user to choose between three rotational speeds.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	The crown can be designed with various weights (as determined by different materials and density) and coated with diamond grit of various width, height and configurations.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	Diamondback 360 crown is available in two configurations classic and solid.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	Crown sizes and configurations are selected based on several case criteria, including reference vessel size, length and degree of stenosis, and anatomy tortuosity.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	The Predator 360 crown is available in the solid configuration and is constructed to allow the crown to engage and treat the lesion more efficiently, which can result in shorter procedure times.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P41_S1	Both the classic and Predator 360 crowns are available in multiple sizes, including 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00 millimeter.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P41_S2	There is also a 2.25 millimeter diameter in the Predator 360 crown configuration.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P41_S3	Currently, the Stealth 360 device is available with a 1.50 millimeter classic crown, and 1.25 millimeter and 2.00 millimeter Predator 360 crown configuration.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P41_S4	For both configurations, the catheter length is 145 centimeters, which addresses procedural approach and target lesion locations both above and below the knee.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	The drive shaft can be designed with various shapes and degrees of rigidity.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	The drive shaft on the Stealth 360 device with a Predator 360 crown configuration is newly-developed, enhancing the ability to advance the device more smoothly and effectively through tortuous anatomy and challenging lesion morphologies, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the device.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	We view the PAD Systems as platforms that can be used to develop additional products by adjusting one or more of the speed, crown and shaft variables.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	The PAD Systems can be used to treat plaque in multiple anatomic locations.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	Below-the-Knee and Behind-the-Knee Peripheral Artery Disease.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	Arteries below and behind the knee have small diameters and may be diffusely diseased, calcified or both, limiting the effectiveness of traditional devices.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P45_S2	Behind-the-knee lesions also present challenges if a stent is required because stents frequently fracture due to the forces exerted on the vessels when the knee bends or flexes.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	The PAD Systems are effective in both diffused and calcified vessels.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	This was demonstrated in the OASIS trial, where 94.5% of lesions treated with the Diamondback 360 were behind or below the knee.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	Plaque in arteries above the knee may also be diffuse, fibrotic and calcific; however, these arteries are longer, straighter and wider than below-the-knee vessels.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	While effective in difficult-to-treat below-the-knee vessels, and indicated for vessels up to four millimeters in diameter, our products are also being used to treat lesions above the knee.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	Given the many similarities between peripheral and coronary artery disease, we have developed a modified version of the Diamondback 360 to treat coronary arteries.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	We have conducted numerous bench studies, pre-clinical animal studies, and our ORBIT I 50-patient human clinical study to evaluate the Diamondback 360 in coronary artery disease.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	A coronary application requires us to conduct a clinical trial and file a premarket application (PMA) and obtain approval from the FDA.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	We participated in three pre-investigational device exemption, or IDE, meetings with the FDA and completed the human feasibility portion of a coronary trial in the summer of 2008 in India, enrolling 50 patients.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P50_S2	The FDA agreed to accept the data from the India trial to support an IDE submission.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P50_S3	The FDA granted unconditional approval in April 2010 to begin the ORBIT II coronary study in the United States.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P50_S4	In May 2011, we received approval from the FDA to complete enrollment of 429 patients in our ORBIT II clinical trial for a coronary application for the Diamondback 360 , which followed the FDA s review of data from the first 50 cases in the ORBIT II trial.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	Our Solution The PAD Systems represent an innovative approach to the treatment of PAD that provides physicians and patients with a procedure that addresses many of the limitations of traditional treatment alternatives.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	The PAD Systems each use single-use catheters that incorporate a flexible drive shaft with an offset diamond grit coated crown.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	Physicians position the crown at the site of an arterial plaque-containing lesion and remove the plaque by positioning the crown to orbit against it, creating a smooth lumen, or channel, in the vessel.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	The PAD Systems are designed to differentiate between hard plaque and soft, compliant arterial tissue, a concept that we refer to as differential sanding.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	Normal arteries are compliant; they have the ability to expand and contract as needed to supply blood flow to the legs and feet.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P54_S1	Arteries burdened with fibrotic (moderately hard) and/or calcified (extremely hard) plaque due to PAD lose their compliance which makes other therapies such as angioplasty, stenting, surgical bypass and atherectomy problematic.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P54_S2	The PAD Systems sand plaque into small particles and restore both blood flow and vessel compliance.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P54_S3	The particles created by the PAD Systems are generally smaller than red blood cells and are carried away by the bloodstream.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P54_S4	The small size of the particles avoids the need for plaque collection reservoirs.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	The PAD Systems can typically treat the diseased arteries with less than two to three minutes of sanding time, potentially reducing the overall procedure time.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P55_S1	We believe that the PAD Systems offer the following key benefits:
1180145_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	Differential Sanding Reduces Risk of Adverse Events.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	The PAD Systems are designed to differentiate between hard plaque and soft compliant arterial tissue.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	Arteries are composed of three tissue layers.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P58_S1	The diamond grit coated offset crown at the working end of the devices engages and removes plaque from the artery wall with minimal likelihood of penetrating or damaging the fragile, inner layer of the arterial wall because soft, compliant tissue flexes away from the crown.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P58_S2	Furthermore, the PAD Systems have rarely penetrated even the middle or outer layers of the artery s wall.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	The Diamondback 360 s perforation rate was 2.4% during our pivotal OASIS trial.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	Analysis by an independent pathology laboratory of more than 434 consecutive cross sections of porcine arteries treated with the Diamondback 360 revealed there was minimal to no damage, on average, to the middle layer, which is typically associated with restenosis.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	In addition, the safety profile of the Diamondback 360 was found to be non-inferior to that of angioplasty, which is often considered the safest of interventional methods.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P60_S2	This was demonstrated in our OASIS trial, which had a low 4.8% rate of device-related serious adverse events, or SAEs.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	Reduces the Risk of Distal Embolization.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	The PAD Systems sand plaque away from artery walls in a manner that produces particles of such a small size generally smaller than red blood cells that they are carried away by the bloodstream.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	The small size of the particles avoids the need for plaque collection reservoirs on the catheter and reduces the need for ancillary distal protection devices, commonly used with directional cutting atherectomy, and also significantly reduces the risk that larger pieces of removed plaque will block blood flow downstream.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	Allows Continuous Blood Flow During Procedure.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	The PAD Systems allow for continuous blood flow during the procedure, except when used in chronic total occlusions.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P63_S2	Other devices may restrict blood flow due to the size of the catheter required or the use of distal protection devices, which could result in complications such as excessive heat and tissue damage.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	Efficacy Demonstrated in a 124-Patient Clinical Trial.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	Our pivotal OASIS clinical trial was a prospective 20-center study that involved 124 patients with 201 lesions treated by the Diamondback 360 .
1180145_11_ITEM1_P65_S1	Performance targets were established cooperatively with the FDA before the trial began.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P65_S2	Despite 55% of the lesions consisting of calcified plaque and 48% of the lesions having a length greater than three centimeters, the performance of the Diamondback 360 in the OASIS trial successfully met the FDA s study endpoints.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P65_S3	Because the Predator 360 and Stealth 360 mechanism of action is identical to that of the Diamondback 360 , no additional efficacy trials were required by the FDA for 510(k) clearance of either PAD System.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	Treats Difficult, Fibrotic and Calcified Lesions.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	The PAD Systems enable physicians to remove plaque from long, fibrotic, calcified or bifurcated lesions in peripheral arteries both above and below the knee.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	Other PAD devices have demonstrated limited effectiveness in treating these challenging lesions.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	The orbiting action of the PAD Systems can create a lumen of approximately 2.0 times the diameter of the crown.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	Non-orbiting rotational atherectomy catheters remove plaque by abrading the lesion with a spinning, abrasive burr, which acts in a manner similar to a drill and only creates a lumen the same size or slightly smaller than the size of the burr.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	The differential sanding of the PAD Systems creates a smooth surface inside the lumen.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	We believe that the smooth lumens created by the devices increase the velocity of blood flow and decrease the resistance to blood flow, which may decrease potential for restenosis, or renarrowing of the arteries.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	Physicians using the PAD Systems employ techniques similar to those used in angioplasty, which are familiar to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists who are trained in endovascular techniques.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	The devices simple user interfaces require minimal additional training.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P71_S2	The devices ability to differentiate between diseased and compliant tissue reduces the risk of complications associated with user error and potentially broadens the user population.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	The orbital technology and differential sanding process of the PAD Systems allows for a single insertion to treat lesions, in most cases.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P72_S1	Because the particles of plaque sanded away are of such small sizes, the PAD Systems do not require a collection reservoir that needs to be repeatedly emptied or cleaned during the procedure.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P72_S2	Rather, the PAD Systems allow for multiple passes of the device over the lesion until plaque is removed and a smooth lumen is created.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	The relative simplicity of our process and predictable crown location allows physicians to significantly reduce fluoroscopy use, thus limiting radiation exposure.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	The PAD Systems have the ability to treat the entire leg, including small vessels below the knee.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	The PAD Systems have a short treatment time.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P75_S1	Treatment with the Diamondback 360 typically ranges from three to four minutes, while treatment time with the Predator 360 and Stealth 360 is typically shorter ranging from 90 seconds to three minutes.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	Single Crown Can Create Various Lumen Sizes Limiting Hospital Inventory Costs.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	The orbital mechanism of action with the PAD Systems allows a single-sized device to create various diameter lumens inside the artery.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P77_S1	Adjusting the rotational speed of the crown changes the orbit to create the desired lumen diameter, thereby potentially avoiding the need to use multiple catheters of different sizes to treat multiple lesions.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	The PAD Systems can create a lumen that is 100% larger than the actual diameter of the device, for a device-to-lumen ratio of approximately 1.0 to 2.0.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	Since the physician does not need to insert and remove multiple catheters or clean a plaque collection reservoir to complete the procedure, there is a potential for decreased procedure time.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	Our goal is to be the leading provider of minimally invasive solutions for the treatment of vascular disease.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P80_S1	The key elements of our strategy include:
1180145_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	Drive Adoption Through Our Direct Sales Organization and Key Physician Leaders.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P81_S1	We expect to continue to drive adoption of the PAD Systems through our direct sales force, which targets interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	focus on educating and training physicians on the PAD Systems through our direct sales force and during seminars where physician industry leaders discuss case studies and treatment techniques using the devices.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	Collect Additional Clinical Evidence on Benefits of the PAD Systems.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P83_S1	Physicians are increasingly requesting clinical study evidence to allow them to make the best treatment decisions to achieve the best possible short-term and long-term outcomes for their patients.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P83_S2	We are focused on collecting and using clinical evidence to demonstrate the advantages of the PAD Systems and drive physician acceptance.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	Expand Product Portfolio within the Market for Treatment of Peripheral Arteries.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P84_S1	In addition to the PAD Systems, we are expanding our product portfolio.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P84_S2	We now offer multiple accessory devices designed to complement the use of the PAD Systems.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P84_S3	We continue to market the following products:
1180145_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	ViperWire Advance guidewire offering improved ability to maneuver through tortuous, twisting blood vessels and cross challenging lesions We are continuing to evaluate internal product development to further expand our portfolio of PAD treatment solutions.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	Leverage Technology Platform into Coronary Market.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P86_S1	Based on the clinical performance of the PAD Systems in treating lower extremity PAD, we intend to leverage the devices capabilities to expand into the interventional coronary market.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P86_S2	A coronary application would address a large market opportunity, further leveraging our core technology and expanding its market potential.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P87_S0	In 2008, we completed the ORBIT I trial, a 50-patient study in India that investigated the safety of the Diamondback 360 device in treating calcified coronary artery lesions.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P87_S1	Results successfully met both safety and efficacy endpoints.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P88_S0	An IDE application has been approved by the FDA for ORBIT II, a pivotal 429 patient trial in the United States to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Diamondback 360 in treating severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P88_S1	In May 2011, we received approval from the FDA to complete enrolment of the 429 patients in our ORBIT II clinical trial, which followed the FDA s review of data from the first 50 cases in the ORBIT II trial.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P89_S0	In August 2009, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Asahi-Intecc, Ltd.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P89_S1	( Asahi ) to market its peripheral guidewire line in the United States.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P89_S2	We offer two Asahi 0.18 wire platforms: the Astato 30 and Treasure 12.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P90_S0	The Astato 30 is a high-penetration guide wire specially designed to break through fibrous caps and calcium deposits, and treat long, complex lesions.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P90_S1	The Treasure 12 has a one-piece core to provide control, torque performance and tactile feedback to the physician.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P91_S0	In addition to adding to our product portfolio through internal development efforts, we intend to continue to explore the acquisition of other product lines, technologies or companies that may leverage our sales force or complement our strategic objectives.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P91_S1	We plan to continue to evaluate distribution agreements, licensing transactions, other strategic partnerships, and the financial viability of marketing the PAD Systems internationally.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P91_S2	Clinical Trials and Studies for Our Products We are committed to providing relevant clinical evidence to allow physicians to select and utilize the best treatment options for their patients.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P91_S3	We have conducted twelve clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the PAD Systems in treating PAD, enrolling a total of 3,746 patients in our PAD I and PAD II pilot trials, OASIS pivotal trial, OASIS LT study demonstrating long term durability of the Diamondback 360 and the CONFIRM DIAMONDBACK, CONFIRM PREDATOR and CONFIRM OUTFLOW Post-Market Registries.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P92_S0	addition, we have also completed enrollment in the CALCIUM 360 and COMPLIANCE 360 post-market, randomized feasibility studies that further differentiate the performance of the Diamondback 360 and Predator 360 from conventional balloon angioplasty.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P92_S1	To demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Diamondback 360 for use in coronary arteries we also completed the ORBIT I coronary clinical trial in India in 2009.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P92_S2	In 2010, we began the ORBIT II pivotal study in the United States, evaluating the use of the Diamondback 360 in coronary arteries.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P92_S3	The common metrics used to evaluate plaque modification and removal devices for PAD include:
1180145_11_ITEM1_P93_S0	Compliance change as defined in the COMPLIANCE 360 protocol is to achieve 30% residual stenosis with orbital atherectomy followed by a low-pressure balloon inflation of 4 atmospheres pressure (atm).
1180145_11_ITEM1_P94_S0	Absolute plaque reduction is the difference between the pre-treatment percent stenosis, or the narrowing of the vessel and the post-treatment percent stenosis as measured angiographically.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P95_S0	Target lesion revascularization rate, or TLR rate, is the percentage of patients at follow-up who have undergone another peripheral intervention in the same lesion due to their worsening symptoms.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P96_S0	Treatments such as an angioplasty, stenting or surgery may be used to reopen the treated lesion site.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P97_S0	The Ankle Brachial Index, or ABI, is a measurement that is useful to evaluate the adequacy of circulation in the legs and improvement or worsening of leg circulation over time.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P97_S1	The ABI is a ratio between the blood pressure in a patient s ankle and a patient s arm, with a ratio above 0.9 being normal.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P97_S2	The common metrics used to evaluate atherectomy devices for PAD include:
1180145_11_ITEM1_P98_S0	SAEs include any experience that is fatal or life-threatening, is permanently disabling, requires or prolongs hospitalization, or requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P98_S1	SAEs may or may not be related to the device.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P99_S0	Perforations occur when the artery is punctured during atherectomy treatment.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P99_S1	Perforations may be nonserious or serious (referred to as an SAE) depending on the treatment required to repair the perforation.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P100_S0	Inclusion criteria for trials often limit size of lesion and severity of disease, as measured by the Rutherford Class, which utilizes a scale of I to VI, with I being mild and VI being most severe, and the ABI.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P101_S0	The first clinical trial was a two-site, 17-patient feasibility clinical trial in Europe, referred to as PAD I, which began in March 2005.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P102_S0	arteries between 1.5 mm and 6.0 mm in diameter, with Rutherford Class scores of IV or lower.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P103_S0	Patients were evaluated at the time of the procedure and at 30 days following treatment.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P103_S1	The purpose of PAD I was to obtain the first human clinical experience and evaluate the safety of the Diamondback 360 .
1180145_11_ITEM1_P103_S2	This was determined by estimating the cumulative incidence of patients experiencing one or more SAEs within 30 days post-treatment.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P103_S3	The results of PAD I confirmed that the Diamondback 360 was safe and established that the Diamondback 360 could be used to treat vessels in the range of 1.5 mm to 4.0 mm, which are found primarily below the knee.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P103_S4	PAD I also showed that removal of plaque could be accomplished and the resulting device-to-lumen ratio was approximately 1.0 to 2.0.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P103_S5	The SAE rate in PAD I was 6% (one of 17 patients).
1180145_11_ITEM1_P104_S0	After being granted the CE Mark in May 2005, a 66-patient European clinical trial, PAD II, was initiated at seven sites, in August 2005.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P104_S1	All patients had stenosis in vessels below the femoral artery of between 1.5 mm and 4.0 mm in diameter, with at least 50% blockage.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P105_S0	The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the acute (30 days or less) risk of experiencing an SAE post procedure and provide evidence of device effectiveness.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P105_S1	Effectiveness was confirmed angiographically and based on the percentage of absolute plaque reduction.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P105_S2	The PAD II results demonstrated safe and effective debulking in vessels with diameters ranging from 1.5 mm to 4.0 mm with a mean absolute plaque reduction of 55%.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P105_S3	The SAE rate in PAD II was 9% (six of 66 patients), which did not differ significantly from existing non-invasive treatment options.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P106_S0	An IDE was approved in September 2005 to begin our pivotal United States trial, OASIS.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P107_S0	OASIS was a 124-patient, 20-center, prospective trial that began enrollment in January 2006.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P107_S1	Patients included in the trial had:
1180145_11_ITEM1_P108_S0	Treated arteries of between 1.5 mm and 4.0 mm or less in diameter via angiogram measurement, with a well-defined lesion of at least 50% diameter stenosis and lesions of no greater than 10.0 cm in length.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P108_S1	The primary efficacy study endpoint was absolute plaque reduction of the target lesions from baseline to immediately post procedure.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P108_S2	The primary safety endpoint was the cumulative incidence of SAEs at 30 days.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P108_S3	In the OASIS trial, 94.5% of lesions treated were behind or below the knee, an area where lesions have traditionally gone untreated until they require bypass surgery or amputation.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P108_S4	Of the lesions treated in OASIS, 55% were comprised of calcified plaque, which presents a challenge to proper expansion and apposition of balloons and stents, and 48% were diffuse, or greater than 3 cm in length, which typically requires multiple balloon expansions or stent placements.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P108_S5	Competing plaque removal devices are often ineffective with these difficult to treat lesions.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P108_S6	The average time of treatment in the OASIS trial was three minutes per lesion, which compares favorably to the treatment time required by other plaque removal devices.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P108_S7	The following table is a summary of the OASIS trial results:
1180145_11_ITEM1_P109_S0	CLEAR 360 Study We conducted the CLEAR 360 study to evaluate the incidence of clinically significant hemolysis associated with orbital atherectomy used to treat severe peripheral arterial disease.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P109_S1	This study enrolled 31 patients at four U.S. medical centers and was completed in 2009.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P109_S2	This trial concluded that there was no clinically significant hemolysis after orbital atherectomy.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P110_S0	OASIS Long-Term Study In 2009 we completed a retrospective study evaluating the long-term results of 64 patients from the pivotal OASIS trial.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P110_S1	Outcomes were analyzed out to a mean of 29 months and include limb salvage rate, TLR rate and ABI.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P110_S2	TLR, or reintervention in the originally treated lesion, was 13.6%.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P110_S3	A 100% limb salvage rate was maintained.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P110_S4	This 29 month data of OASIS patients adds to our confidence in the safety and efficacy of the Diamondback 360 .
1180145_11_ITEM1_P111_S0	In May 2010, enrollment was completed in the COMPLIANCE 360 clinical trial, the first of two PAD post-market studies initiated in calendar 2009.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P111_S1	This prospective, randomized, multi-center study evaluated the clinical and economic benefits of modifying plaque to change large vessel compliance above the knee with the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 .
1180145_11_ITEM1_P111_S2	The study compared the performance of the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 , plus low-pressure balloon inflation, if desired, with that of high-pressure balloon inflation alone.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P111_S3	Fifty patients were enrolled at nine U.S. medical centers.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P111_S4	The results of this trial showed that the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 can achieve superior results in treating calcified plaque by improving lesion compliance through differential sanding, without the need for stent placement.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P111_S5	Trial results with a p-value of less than 0.0001 statistically demonstrated the success rate in the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 arm of the trial had a procedural success rate of 360% greater than in the balloon arm of the trial and required 91% less bailout stenting.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P111_S6	The six month study results will be presented as an oral presentation at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics, or TCT, conference in November 2011 in San Francisco, CA.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P111_S7	Patients will complete their 12 month follow up by the end of September 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P111_S8	Twenty four months of data will continue to be collected.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P112_S0	In April 2010, enrollment was completed in the CALCIUM 360 study, a prospective, randomized, multi-center study comparing the effectiveness of the Diamondback 360 and Predator 360 to balloon angioplasty in treating calcified lesions below the knee.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P113_S0	Calcified plaque exists in about 75 percent of lesions below the knee.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P114_S0	Fifty patients were enrolled at eight U.S. medical centers.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P114_S1	Six-month results showed orbital treatment outperformed balloon angioplasty.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P114_S2	A key finding was that by modifying calcified lesions first, the Diamondback 360 and Predator 360 allow use of a lower-pressure adjunctive balloon therapy, reducing the need for bailout stenting with anticipated improved longer-term patient outcomes.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P114_S3	Orbital treatment outperformed balloon angioplasty on the primary endpoint of device success (less than or equal to 30% restenosis with no dissection C-F) with 92.6% in the Diamondback 360 and Predator 360 arm of the trial versus 78.8% in the balloon arm of the trial.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P114_S4	These results will be reported as an abstract at the San Francisco TCT conference.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P114_S5	Patients will complete their 12 month follow up by the end of September 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P114_S6	Twenty four months of data will continue to be collected.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P115_S0	CONFIRM Post-Market Clinical Registry Series We are conducting the CONFIRM Post-Market Clinical Registry Series, which will further evaluate acute and economic parameters related to the use of the PAD Systems.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P115_S1	The CONFIRM Series currently consists of three registries: CONFIRM I DIAMONDBACK, CONFIRM II PREDATOR, and CONFIRM III OUTFLOW.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P115_S2	Post-Market Registry was completed in March 2010.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P115_S3	In this prospective registry, 1,138 lesions were treated by 84 investigators at 57 medical centers with the Diamondback 360 .
1180145_11_ITEM1_P115_S4	Patient characteristics were as follows: 81.6% were smokers, 60.0% were diabetic, and 89.7% had hypertension.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P115_S5	Lesions treated were above the knee (46.5%), behind the knee (17.5%), and below the knee (36.0%).
1180145_11_ITEM1_P116_S0	low pressure balloon angioplasty, if desired.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P117_S0	Bail-out stenting, or stenting required due to tears in the vessel wall, occurred in 2.2% of lesions, which is also consistent with the 2.5% reported in OASIS.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P117_S1	This is lower than the 35% to 40% bail-out stent rate reported in the literature for patients treated with high pressure balloon angioplasty alone in this type of challenging patient population.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P118_S0	Enrollment of 1,145 patients in the prospective CONFIRM II PREDATOR Post-Market Registry was completed December 2010.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P119_S0	The CONFIRM II PREDATOR evaluated clinical performance of the Predator 360 .
1180145_11_ITEM1_P119_S1	Data on acute clinical performance and short-term economic parameters were collected during this study.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P119_S2	An abstract will be presented at the San Francisco TCT conference.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P120_S0	Data from CONFIRM DIAMONDBACK and PREDATOR registries were used to design the CONFIRM III OUTFLOW registry.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P120_S1	This is the third study in the CONFIRM series to further evaluate acute procedural outcomes and economic parameters associated with use of the PAD Systems.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P121_S0	Enrollment of 1,275 patients in the CONFIRM III OUTFLOW Post-Market Registry was completed June 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P121_S1	Data will be reported at future scientific conferences.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P122_S0	I trial, a 50-patient study in India, was completed in 2009.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P122_S1	This feasibility trial investigated the safety of the Diamondback 360 in treating calcified coronary artery lesions.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P122_S2	The safety was evaluated by six-months MACE rate.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P122_S3	Study results showed the device success for the study was 100%.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P122_S4	Six months MACE rate was 8%.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P123_S0	The ORBIT I trial confirmed that the OAS is safe in treating subjects with de novo calcified coronary artery disease.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P123_S1	The 6 month results will be presented at the TCT conference in 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P123_S2	ORBIT II Coronary IDE Study To market the Diamondback 360 in the United States for use in the coronary arteries, we are required to conduct further clinical trials and obtain premarket approval from the FDA.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P123_S3	In May 2010, the IDE was FDA approved and we began the ORBIT II pivotal clinical trial.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P123_S4	This trial plans to enroll 429 patients in up to 50 U.S. investigational centers to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Diamondback 360 in treating severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P123_S5	In May 2011, we received approval from the FDA to complete enrollment of 429 patients in our ORBIT II clinical trial for a coronary application for the Diamondback 360 , which followed the FDA s review of data from the first 50 cases in the ORBIT II trial.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P124_S0	Sales and Marketing We market and sell the PAD Systems through a direct sales force in the United States.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P124_S1	While we sell directly to hospitals and office based laboratories, we have targeted sales and marketing efforts to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists with experience using similar catheter-based procedures, such as angioplasty, stenting, and cutting or laser atherectomy.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P124_S2	Physician referral programs and peer-to-peer education are other key elements of our sales strategy.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P125_S0	Patient referrals come from general practitioners, podiatrists, nephrologists and endocrinologists.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P125_S1	We target our marketing efforts to practitioners through physician education, medical conferences, seminars, peer reviewed journals and marketing materials.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P125_S2	Our sales and marketing program focuses on:
1180145_11_ITEM1_P126_S0	We are not marketing our products internationally; however, we will continue to evaluate international opportunities.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P127_S0	We executed a Purchasing Agreement with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, L.P., or HPG, that became effective on July 15, 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P127_S1	HPG acts as a group purchasing organization for the healthcare providers belonging to HPG as participants.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P127_S2	Under the Purchasing Agreement, all of HPG s participants located in the United States or its territories are eligible to purchase the PAD Systems and related products at prices set forth in the Purchasing Agreement.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P127_S3	HPG has agreed not to contract with more than one alternative supplier from which participants may purchase products comparable to ours under the agreement.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P127_S4	During the term of the agreement, we have agreed to not solicit any HPG participant to enter into a separate agreement for our products.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P128_S0	Research and Development Our research and development efforts are focused in the development of products to penetrate our three key target markets: below and behind-the-knee, above-the-knee and coronary vessels.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P128_S1	Research and development projects include the development of electric versions of the PAD Systems, shaft designs, crown designs, and PAD and coronary clinical trials.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P128_S2	Research and development expenses for fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were $8.9 million, $10.3 million and $14.7 million, respectively.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P129_S0	Manufacturing We use internally-manufactured and externally-sourced components to manufacture the PAD Systems.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P129_S1	Most of the externally-sourced components are available from multiple suppliers; however, a few key components, including the diamond grit coated crown, micro motors, and printed circuit board assemblies, are single sourced.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P129_S2	We assemble the shaft, crown and handle components on-site, and test, pack, seal and label the finished assembly before sending the packaged product to a contract sterilization facility.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P129_S3	Upon return from the sterilizer, product is held in inventory prior to shipping to our customers.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P129_S4	Our manufacturing facility in Minnesota, including the shaft manufacturing and the controlled-environment assembly areas, are equipped to accommodate approximately 30,000 devices per shift annually.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P129_S5	It also has storage capacity for approximately 8,000 devices and 50 control units.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P129_S6	As the control unit becomes obsolete, we will convert our storage space for use with the Stealth 360 PAD System.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P129_S7	Our Pearland, Texas facility is 46,000 square feet and includes a custom-built clean room and production space for future expansion of value-add processes, including machining and electronics assembly.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P129_S8	The facility, when it becomes fully staffed and equipped, will have the capacity to produce approximately 75,000 devices per shift annually.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P129_S9	This facility has finished goods storage capacity for greater than 15,000 devices of the PAD Systems and other accessory products and over 500 Stealth 360 saline infusion pumps.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P129_S10	We are registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P129_S11	We have opted to maintain quality assurance and quality management certifications to enable us to market our products in the member states of the European Union, the European Free Trade Association and countries that have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements with the European Union.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P129_S12	We are ISO 13485:2003 certified, and our renewal is due by December 2012.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P129_S13	During the time of commercialization, we have had two minor instances of recall, involving one single lot of Diamondback 360 devices (eight units), and two boxes of ViperWires (ten wires), related to Use By date labeling issues.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P129_S14	While these recalls were reported to the FDA, according to regulations, they did not provide a risk to patient safety.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P130_S0	A third recall, initiated in 2009 and completed in 2010, involved the ViperSheath, which is owned and manufactured by Thomas Medical Products.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P130_S1	As the distributor for the ViperSheath, we were required to recall all unused units from our customers and return them to Thomas Medical Products.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P130_S2	All of the unused ViperSheaths were captured and subsequently destroyed by Thomas Medical Products, with FDA observance.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P131_S0	Third-Party Reimbursement and Pricing Third-party payors, including private insurers, and government insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, pay for a significant portion of patient care provided in the United States.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P131_S1	The single largest payor in the United States is the Medicare program, a federal governmental health insurance program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P132_S0	In addition, private insurers often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P132_S1	Consequently, Medicare s coverage and reimbursement policies are important to our operations.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P133_S0	CMS has established Medicare reimbursement codes describing atherectomy products and procedures using atherectomy products, and many private insurers follow these policies.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P133_S1	We believe that physicians and hospitals that treat PAD with the PAD Systems will generally be eligible to receive reimbursement from Medicare and private insurers for the cost of the single-use catheter and the physician s services.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P133_S2	The continued availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved medical devices is uncertain.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P133_S3	The commercial success of our products in both domestic and international markets will be dependent on whether third-party coverage and reimbursement is available for patients that use our products.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P133_S4	Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new medical devices, and, as a result, they may not continue to provide adequate payment for our products.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P133_S5	To position our device for acceptance by third-party payors, we may have to agree to a lower net sales price than we might otherwise charge.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P133_S6	The continuing efforts of governmental and commercial third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare may limit our revenue.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P134_S0	In some foreign markets, pricing and profitability of medical devices are subject to government control.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P134_S1	In the United States, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P134_S2	Also, the trends toward managed healthcare in the United States and legislation intended to reduce the cost of government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and may result in lower prices for our products or the exclusion of our products from reimbursement programs.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P135_S0	Competition The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P135_S1	The PAD Systems compete with a variety of other products or devices for the treatment of vascular disease, including stents, balloon angioplasty catheters and atherectomy catheters, as well as products used in vascular surgery.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P135_S2	Large competitors in the stent and balloon angioplasty market segments include Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific, Cook Medical, Johnson Johnson and Medtronic.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P135_S3	We also compete against manufacturers of atherectomy catheters including, among others, Covidien, Spectranetics, Boston Scientific and Pathway Medical Technologies, as well as other manufacturers that may enter the market due to the increasing demand for treatment of vascular disease.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P135_S4	Other competitors include pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs for the treatment of mild to moderate PAD and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral bypass procedures.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P135_S5	We are not aware of any competing catheter systems either currently on the market or in development that also use an orbital motion to create lumens larger than the catheter itself.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P136_S0	Because of the size of the peripheral opportunities, competitors and potential competitors have historically dedicated significant resources to aggressively promote their products.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P136_S1	We believe that the PAD Systems compete primarily on the basis of:
1180145_11_ITEM1_P137_S0	Patents and Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and other intellectual property laws, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P137_S1	As of July 31, 2011, we held 21 issued U.S. patents and have 31 U.S. patent applications pending, as well as 63 issued or granted foreign patents and 98 foreign patent applications, each of which corresponds to aspects of our U.S. patents and applications.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P137_S2	Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2011 and 2027, and our most important patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,494,890, is due to expire in 2017.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P137_S3	Our issued patents and patent applications relate primarily to the design and operation of certain interventional atherectomy devices, including the PAD Systems.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P137_S4	These patents and applications include claims covering key aspects of certain rotational atherectomy devices, including the design, manufacture and therapeutic use of certain atherectomy abrasive heads, drive shafts, control systems, handles and couplings.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P137_S5	As we continue to research and develop our atherectomy technology, we intend to file additional U.S. and foreign patent applications related to the design, manufacture and therapeutic uses of atherectomy devices.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P137_S6	In addition, we hold ten registered U.S. trademarks, six registered marks in Europe, five registered marks in Canada, and three U.S. trademark applications pending.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P137_S7	We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P137_S8	We seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P137_S9	Agreements with our employees also forbid them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P137_S10	We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P138_S0	Government Regulation of Medical Devices Governmental authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local levels and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of medical devices such as the PAD Systems.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P138_S1	Failure to obtain approval to market our products under development and to meet the ongoing requirements of these regulatory authorities could prevent us from marketing and continuing to market our products.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P139_S0	United States The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the FDA s implementing regulations govern medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P139_S1	Medical devices and their manufacturers are also subject to inspection by the FDA.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P139_S2	The FDCA, supplemented by other federal and state laws, also provides civil and criminal penalties for violations of its provisions.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P140_S0	We manufacture and market medical devices that are regulated by the FDA, comparable state agencies and regulatory bodies in other countries.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P140_S1	Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the United States will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P141_S0	The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization are premarket notification (also called 510(k) clearance) and premarket approval (also called PMA approval).
1180145_11_ITEM1_P142_S0	The type of marketing authorization applicable to a device 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is generally linked to classification of the device.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P143_S0	The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk FDA determines to be associated with a device and the extent of control deemed necessary to ensure the device s safety and effectiveness.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P143_S1	Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P143_S2	Class I devices are deemed to pose the least risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling, premarket notification, and adherence to the FDA s current good manufacturing practice requirements, as reflected in its Quality System Regulation, or QSR.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P144_S0	Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, and include life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, and devices not substantially equivalent to a device that is already legally marketed.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P144_S1	Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from FDA.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P144_S2	Class I and Class II devices that have not been so exempted are eligible for marketing through the 510(k) clearance pathway.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P144_S3	By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require PMA approval prior to commercial marketing.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P144_S4	The PMA approval process is generally more stringent, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) clearance process.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P144_S5	To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device legally marketed in the United States.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P144_S6	A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P144_S7	A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P145_S0	Generally, the 510(k) clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a year or more.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P146_S0	After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval (if the device as modified is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device).
1180145_11_ITEM1_P146_S1	The determination as to whether new authorization is needed is initially left to the manufacturer; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P146_S2	The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P146_S3	We received 510(k) clearance for use of the Diamondback 360 as a therapy in patients with PAD in the United States on August 22, 2007.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P146_S4	We received additional 510(k) clearances for the control unit used with the Diamondback 360 on October 25, 2007 and for the solid crown version of the Diamondback 360 on November 9, 2007.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P146_S5	We were granted 510(k) clearance of the Predator 360 in March 2009 and Stealth 360 in March 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P147_S0	A PMA application requires the payment of significant user fees and must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P147_S1	A PMA application must also include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P148_S0	After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P148_S1	During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P148_S2	Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P148_S3	In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the FDA s Quality System Regulations, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P148_S4	FDA review of a PMA application is required by statute to take no longer than 180 days, although the process typically takes significantly longer, and may require several years to complete.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P148_S5	The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
1180145_11_ITEM1_P149_S0	changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P150_S0	If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P150_S1	When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P150_S2	If the FDA s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P150_S3	The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P150_S4	Even if a PMA application is approved, the FDA may approve the device with an indication that is narrower or more limited than originally sought.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P150_S5	The agency can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of the device as a condition of approval, or impose post approval requirements such as continuing evaluation and periodic reporting on the safety, efficacy and reliability of the device for its intended use.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P151_S0	New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P151_S1	PMA approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P152_S0	We are currently enrolling patients in an FDA approved Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) trial to support a PMA to use the Diamondback 360 as a therapy in treating patients with coronary artery disease.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P152_S1	The FDA granted unconditional approval in April 2010 to begin the ORBIT II coronary trial in the United States.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P152_S2	This pivotal trial is set up in two phases; Phase I allows us to enroll up to 100 patients at as many as 50 U.S. sites, Phase II allows us to expand the trial to the full complement of 429 patients.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P152_S3	The FDA granted us approval to move to Phase II in May of 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P153_S0	Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P153_S1	These trials generally require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P153_S2	The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P153_S3	The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P153_S4	Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P153_S5	FDA approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P153_S6	With certain exceptions, changes made to an investigational plan after an IDE is approved must be submitted in an IDE supplement and approved by FDA (and by governing institutional review boards when appropriate) prior to implementation.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P154_S0	All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with regulations and requirements collectively known as good clinical practice.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P154_S1	Good clinical practices include the FDA s IDE regulations, which describe the conduct of clinical trials with medical devices, including the recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of sponsors and investigators, and labeling of investigation devices.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P154_S2	They also prohibit promotion, test marketing or commercialization of an investigational device and any representation that such a device is safe or effective for the purposes being investigated.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P154_S3	Good clinical practices also include the FDA s regulations for institutional review board approval and for protection of human subjects (such as informed consent), as well as disclosure of financial interests by clinical investigators.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P155_S0	Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P155_S1	The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P155_S2	The commencement or completion of any clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application or clearance of a premarket notification for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:
1180145_11_ITEM1_P156_S0	the FDA concludes that the trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P157_S0	After a device is approved and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P158_S0	product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device that may present a risk to health.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P158_S1	In addition, the FDA may require a company to conduct postmarket surveillance studies or order it to establish and maintain a system for tracking its products through the chain of distribution to the patient level.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P158_S2	Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions:
1180145_11_ITEM1_P159_S0	We and our contract manufacturers, specification developers and suppliers are also required to manufacture our products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, requirements set forth in the QSR.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P159_S1	The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing and record keeping.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P159_S2	The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P159_S3	If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers is not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to clear or approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P159_S4	Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P159_S5	Fraud and Abuse Our operations will be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the FDCA, federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P159_S6	These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P159_S7	In addition, these laws require us to screen individuals and other companies, suppliers and vendors in order to ensure that they are not debarred by the federal government and therefore prohibited from doing business in the healthcare industry.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P160_S0	The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P160_S1	Several courts have interpreted the statute s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P161_S0	The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P161_S1	Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P162_S0	The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P162_S1	Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P163_S0	In addition to the laws described above, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P164_S0	The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P164_S1	The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P165_S0	In addition to impacting our marketing and educational programs, internal business processes will be affected by the numerous legal requirements and regulatory guidance at the state, federal and industry levels.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P166_S0	International Regulation International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P166_S1	The time required to obtain approval in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P166_S2	For example, the primary regulatory environment in Europe with respect to medical devices is that of the European Union, which includes most of the major countries in Europe.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P166_S3	Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P167_S0	The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P167_S1	Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the European Union, although actual implementation of these directives may vary on a country-by-country basis.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P168_S0	The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of submission of a design dossier, self-assessment by the manufacturer, a third-party assessment and, review of the design dossier by a Notified Body.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P168_S1	This third-party assessment generally consists of an audit of the manufacturer s quality system and manufacturing site, as well as review of the technical documentation used to support application of the CE mark to one s product and possibly specific testing of the manufacturer s product.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P169_S0	An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the European Union is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P169_S1	We obtained CE marking approval for sale of the Diamondback 360 in May 2005.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P170_S0	Our operations are subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P170_S1	We are currently classified and licensed as a Very Small Quantity Hazardous Waste Generator within Ramsey County, Minnesota.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P170_S2	There are no regulated wastes requiring licensing in our Texas facility.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P171_S0	As of June 30, 2011, we had 286 employees, including 66 employees in manufacturing, 166 employees in sales, six employees in marketing, seven employees in clinical, 23 employees in general and administrative, and 18 employees in research and development, all of which are full-time employees.
1180145_11_ITEM1_P171_S1	None of our employees are represented by a labor union or parties to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We have a history of net losses and may continue to incur losses.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We are not profitable and have incurred net losses in each fiscal year since our formation in 1989.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	In particular, we had net losses of $11.1 million in fiscal 2011, $23.9 million in fiscal 2010, and $31.9 million in fiscal 2009.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P0_S3	As of June 30, 2011, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $162.4 million.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We commenced commercial sales of the Diamondback 360 in September 2007, and our short commercialization experience makes it difficult for us to predict future performance.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We also expect to incur significant additional expenses for sales and marketing and manufacturing as we continue to commercialize the PAD Systems and additional expenses as we seek to develop and commercialize future versions of the PAD Systems and other products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Additionally, we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as our business grows.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P1_S3	As a result, our operating losses could continue.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We may be unable to sustain our revenue growth.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our revenue has grown in each of the three complete fiscal years since we commenced commercial sales of the Diamondback 360 in September 2007.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Our ability to continue to increase our revenues in future periods will depend on our ability to increase sales of the PAD Systems and new and improved products we introduce, including growing our customer base and reorders of the PAD Systems from those customers.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We may not be able to generate, sustain or increase revenues on a quarterly or annual basis.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S4	If we cannot achieve or sustain revenue growth for an extended period, our financial results will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Economic conditions may adversely affect our business.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Adverse worldwide economic conditions may have adverse implications on our business.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S7	For example, our customers ability to borrow money from their existing lenders or to obtain credit from other sources to fund operations may be impaired resulting in a decrease in sales.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Although we review our customers financial condition and ability to pay on an ongoing basis and we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S9	A significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of our customers could cause unfavorable trends in our receivable collections and additional allowances may be required, which could adversely affect our operating results.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Adverse worldwide economic conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers ability to provide us with materials and components, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S11	In addition, uncertainty about current global economic conditions could increase the volatility of our stock price.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S12	We have a limited history selling the PAD Systems, which are currently our primary products, and our inability to market these products successfully would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S13	Although we also sell a variety of ancillary products, the PAD Systems are our primary products and we are largely dependent on them.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S14	We have limited experience in the commercial manufacturing and marketing of these products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S15	Our ability to generate revenue will depend upon our ability to further successfully commercialize the PAD Systems and to develop, manufacture and receive required regulatory clearances and approvals and patient reimbursement for treatment with future versions of the PAD Systems.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S16	As we continue to commercialize the PAD Systems, we may need to expand our sales force to reach our target market.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S17	Developing a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay or limit the success of any product launch.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S18	Thus, we may not be able to expand our sales and marketing capabilities on a timely basis or at all.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S19	If we are unable to adequately increase these capabilities, we will need to contract with third parties to market and sell the PAD Systems and any other products that we may develop.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S20	To the extent that we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services on our behalf, our product revenues could be lower than if we marketed and sold our products on a direct basis.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S21	Furthermore, any revenues resulting from co-promotion or other marketing and sales arrangements with other companies will depend on the skills and efforts of others, and we do not know whether these efforts will be successful.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S22	If we fail to successfully develop, commercialize and market the PAD Systems or any future versions of these products that we develop, our business will be materially adversely affected.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S23	The PAD Systems and future products may never achieve broad market acceptance.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S24	The PAD Systems and future products we may develop may never gain broad market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S25	The degree of market acceptance of any of our products will depend on a number of factors, including:
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	the level of education and awareness among physicians and hospitals concerning our products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Failure of the PAD Systems to significantly penetrate current or new markets would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	If longer-term or more extensive clinical trials performed by us or others indicate that procedures using the PAD Systems or any future products are not safe, effective and long lasting, physicians may choose not to use our products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Furthermore, unsatisfactory patient outcomes or injuries could cause negative publicity for our products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Physicians may be slow to adopt our products if they perceive liability risks arising from the use of these products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P3_S5	It is also possible that as our products become more widely used, latent defects could be identified, creating negative publicity and liability problems for us, thereby adversely affecting demand for our products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P3_S6	If the PAD Systems and our future products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients and the medical community, our overall business and profitability would be harmed.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P3_S7	Our future growth depends on physician adoption of the PAD Systems, which requires physicians to change their screening and referral practices.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We believe that we must educate physicians to change their screening and referral practices.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	For example, although there is a significant correlation between PAD and coronary artery disease, many physicians do not routinely screen for PAD while screening for coronary artery disease.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We target our sales efforts to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists because they are often the primary care physicians diagnosing and treating both coronary artery disease and PAD.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	However, the initial point of contact for many patients may be general practitioners, podiatrists, nephrologists and endocrinologists, each of whom commonly treats patients experiencing complications resulting from PAD.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P4_S4	If referring physicians are not educated about PAD in general and the existence of the PAD Systems in particular, they may not refer patients to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons or interventional radiologists for the procedure using the PAD Systems, and those patients may instead be surgically treated or treated with an alternative interventional procedure.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P4_S5	If we are not successful in educating physicians about screening for PAD or referral opportunities, our ability to increase our revenue may be impaired.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Our customers may not be able to achieve adequate reimbursement for using the PAD Systems, which could affect the acceptance of our products and cause our business to suffer.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved medical devices and procedures is uncertain.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The commercial success of our products is substantially dependent on whether third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement for the use of such products and related services are available.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We expect the PAD Systems to generally be purchased by hospitals and other providers who will then seek reimbursement from various public and private third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers, for the services provided to patients.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	We can give no assurance that these third-party payors will provide adequate reimbursement for use of the PAD Systems to permit hospitals and doctors to consider the products cost-effective for patients requiring PAD treatment, or that current reimbursement levels for the PAD Systems will continue.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P5_S4	In addition, the overall amount of reimbursement available for PAD treatment could decrease in the future.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain sufficient reimbursement could cause our business to suffer.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement, and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for use of the PAD Systems.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P5_S7	In order to position the PAD Systems for acceptance by third-party payors, we may have to agree to lower prices than we might otherwise charge.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Governmental and private sector payors have instituted initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs using, for example, price regulation or controls and competitive pricing programs.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Some third-party payors also require demonstrated superiority, on the basis of randomized clinical trials, or pre-approval of coverage, for new or innovative devices or procedures before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such devices or procedures.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	It is uncertain whether the PAD Systems or any future products we may develop will be viewed as sufficiently cost-effective to warrant adequate coverage and reimbursement levels.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If third-party coverage and reimbursement for the PAD Systems is limited or not available, the acceptance of the PAD Systems and, consequently, our business will be substantially harmed.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Healthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P6_S5	There have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control healthcare costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P6_S7	The adoption of some or all of these proposals, including the recent federal legislation, could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Patient Act.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The impact on the healthcare industry of the Patient Act is extensive and includes, among other things, having the federal government assume a larger role in the healthcare system, expanding healthcare coverage of United States citizens and mandating basic healthcare benefits.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Elements of this legislation, such as comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, payment system reforms, including shared savings programs and other provisions, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and may materially impact numerous aspects of our business.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P7_S3	These changes may impact reimbursement for health care services, including reimbursement to hospitals and physicians.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P7_S4	States may also enact further legislation that impacts Medicaid payments to hospitals and physicians.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P7_S5	In addition, the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services, the Federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, may establish new payment levels for hospitals and physicians in line with the new legislation, which could increase or decrease payment to such entities.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The healthcare reform legislation and any future legislative and regulatory initiatives could adversely affect demand for our products and have a material adverse impact on our operating results.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Any healthcare reforms enacted in the future may, like the Patient Act, be phased in over a number of years but, if enacted, could reduce our revenues, increase our costs, or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by changes under the Patient Act and changes under any federal or state legislation adopted in the future.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The Patient Act also imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These taxes will result in a significant increase in the tax burden on our industry, which could have a material, negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	As rules and regulations are developed under the new law, there may be exemptions created for certain types or classes of products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We may find, however, that there are no exemptions applicable to our products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	This tax will impact our cost of doing business and may ultimately lower our profit margins.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Additionally, the increased cost of business caused by this tax may hinder our ability to spend money on research and development of our products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We may be required to increase the prices of our devices to offset the additional cost of the tax.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Medicaid and health insurance providers may place a cap on the reimbursement for purchases of our devices that will not allow us to offset the cost of the tax.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P10_S6	We may ultimately lose customers who are unwilling or unable to pay the increased costs, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We have limited data and experience regarding the safety and efficacy of the PAD Systems.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Any long-term data that is generated may not be positive or consistent with our limited short-term data, which would affect market acceptance of these products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Our success depends on the acceptance of the PAD Systems by the medical community as safe and effective.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The long-term effects of using the PAD Systems in a large number of patients are not known and the results of short-term clinical use of the PAD Systems do not necessarily predict long-term clinical benefit or reveal long-term adverse effects.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	If the results obtained from any future clinical trials or clinical or commercial experience indicate that the PAD Systems are not as safe or effective as other treatment options or as current short-term data would suggest, adoption of these products may suffer and our business would be harmed.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Even if we believe that the data collected from clinical trials or clinical experience indicate positive results, each physician s actual experience with our device will vary.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Clinical trials conducted with the PAD Systems have involved procedures performed by physicians who are very technically proficient.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Consequently, both short and long-term results reported in these studies may be significantly more favorable than typical results achieved by physicians, which could negatively impact market acceptance of the PAD Systems.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We face significant competition and may be unable to sell the PAD Systems at profitable levels.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We compete against very large and well-known stent and balloon angioplasty device manufacturers, including Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific, Cook Medical, Johnson Johnson and Medtronic.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We may have difficulty competing effectively with these competitors because of their well-established positions in the marketplace, significant financial and human capital resources, established reputations and worldwide distribution channels.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We also compete against manufacturers of atherectomy catheters including, among others, Covidien, Spectranetics, Boston Scientific and Pathway Medical Technologies, as well as other manufacturers that may enter the market due to the increasing demand for treatment of vascular disease.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Several other companies provide products used by surgeons in peripheral bypass procedures.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Other competitors include pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs for the treatment of mild to moderate PAD and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral bypass procedures.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	develop more effective or less expensive products or technologies that render our technology or products obsolete or non-competitive.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We have encountered and expect to continue to encounter potential customers who, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to or prefer the products offered by these competitors.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If we are unable to compete successfully, our revenue will suffer.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Increased competition might lead to price reductions and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Competitive pressures may decrease the demand for our products and could adversely affect our financial results.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Our ability to compete depends on our ability to innovate successfully.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P15_S6	If our competitors demonstrate the increased safety or efficacy of their products as compared to ours, our revenue may decline.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The market for medical devices is highly competitive, dynamic and marked by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our ability to compete depends on our ability to innovate successfully, and there are few barriers that would prevent new entrants or existing competitors from developing products that compete directly with our products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Demand for the PAD Systems could be diminished by equivalent or superior products and technologies offered by competitors.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Our competitors may produce more advanced products than ours or demonstrate superior safety and efficacy of their products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P16_S4	If we are unable to innovate successfully, the PAD Systems could become obsolete and our revenue would decline as our customers purchase competitor products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We have limited commercial manufacturing experience and could experience difficulty in producing the PAD Systems or will need to depend on third parties to manufacture the products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We have limited experience in commercially manufacturing the PAD Systems and have no experience manufacturing these products in the volume that we anticipate will be required if we achieve planned levels of commercial sales.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	As a result, we may not be able to develop and implement efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to manufacture the PAD Systems or future products in significant volumes, while meeting the legal, regulatory, quality, price, durability, engineering, design and production standards required to market our products successfully.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If we fail to develop and implement these manufacturing capabilities and processes, we may be unable to profitably commercialize the PAD Systems and any future products we may develop because the per unit cost of our products is highly dependent upon production volumes and the level of automation in our manufacturing processes.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	There are technical challenges to increasing manufacturing capacity, including equipment design and automation capabilities, material procurement, problems with production yields and quality control and assurance.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Increasing our manufacturing capacity may require that we invest substantial additional funds and hire and retain additional management and technical personnel who have the necessary manufacturing experience.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We may not successfully complete any required increase in manufacturing capacity in a timely manner or at all.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S3	If we are unable to manufacture a sufficient supply of our products, maintain control over expenses or otherwise adapt to anticipated growth, or if we underestimate growth, we may not have the capability to satisfy market demand and our business will suffer.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S4	The forecasts of demand we use to determine order quantities and lead times for components purchased from outside suppliers may be incorrect.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Failure to obtain required components or subassemblies when needed and at a reasonable cost would adversely affect our business.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S6	In addition, we may in the future need to depend upon third parties to manufacture the PAD Systems and future products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S7	We also cannot assure you that any third-party contract manufacturers will have the ability to produce the quantities of our products needed for development or commercial sales or will be willing to do so at prices that allow the products to compete successfully in the market.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Additionally, we can give no assurance that even if we do contract with third-party manufacturers for production that these manufacturers will not experience manufacturing difficulties or experience quality or regulatory issues.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S9	Any difficulties in locating and hiring third-party manufacturers, or in the ability of third-party manufacturers to supply quantities of our products at the times and in the quantities we need, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S10	We depend upon third-party suppliers, including single source suppliers to us and our customers, making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S11	We rely on third-party suppliers to provide us with certain components of our products and to provide key components or supplies to our customers for use with our products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S12	We rely on single source suppliers for the components of the PAD Systems.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S13	We purchase components from these suppliers on a purchase order basis and carry only limited levels of inventory for these components.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S14	If we underestimate our requirements, we may not have an adequate supply, which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and loss of revenue.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S15	Conversely, an overestimation of our requirements will reduce our cash available for operations and may result in excess or obsolete materials.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S16	We depend on our suppliers to provide us and our customers with materials in a timely manner that meet our and their quality, quantity and cost requirements.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S17	These suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand and our customers demand.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S18	Our reliance on these outside suppliers also subjects us to other risks that could harm our business, including:
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	our suppliers may encounter financial hardships unrelated to us or our customers demand for components or other products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Any supply interruption from our suppliers or failure to obtain additional suppliers for any of the components used in our products would limit our ability to manufacture our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If we lost one of these suppliers and were unable to obtain an alternate source on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, our production schedules could be delayed, our margins could be negatively impacted, and we could fail to meet our customers demand.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Our customers rely upon our ability to meet committed delivery dates and any disruption in the supply of key components would adversely affect our ability to meet these dates and could result in legal action by our customers, cause us to lose customers or harm our ability to attract new customers, any of which could decrease our revenue and negatively impact our growth.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P19_S4	In addition, to the extent that our suppliers use technology or manufacturing processes that are proprietary, we may be unable to obtain comparable materials or components from alternative sources.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P19_S5	We may be faced with a supplier s decision to discontinue manufacturing a component, which may force us or our customers to make last time purchases, qualify a substitute part, or make a design change which may divert engineering time away from the development of new products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions or the exclusion of some suppliers from our market segment, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	This in turn has resulted in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our hospital customers.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors, which may reduce competition, exert downward pressure on the prices of our products and adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We may need to increase the size of our organization and we may experience difficulties managing growth.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P20_S4	If we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business, our future revenue and operating results may be adversely affected.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P20_S5	The growth we may experience in the future may provide challenges to our organization, requiring us to rapidly expand our sales and marketing personnel and manufacturing operations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	has increased from six full-time employees on January 1, 2007 to 172 full-time employees on June 30, 2011, and we expect to continue to grow our sales and marketing force in the future.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We also expect to significantly expand our manufacturing operations to meet anticipated growth in demand for our products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Rapid expansion in personnel may result in less experienced people producing and selling our product, which could result in unanticipated costs and disruptions to our operations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P21_S3	If we cannot scale and manage our business appropriately, our anticipated growth may be impaired and our financial results will suffer.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P21_S4	We may require additional financing, and our failure to obtain additional financing when needed could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P21_S5	We may be dependent on additional financing to execute our business plan.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P21_S6	We may require additional capital in order to continue to conduct the research and development and obtain regulatory clearances and approvals necessary to bring any future products to market and to establish effective marketing and sales capabilities for existing and future products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Our operating plan may change, and we may need additional funds sooner than anticipated to meet our operational needs and capital requirements for product development, clinical trials and commercialization.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P21_S9	If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, we may terminate or delay the development of one or more of our products, or delay establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P21_S10	Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	the extent and scope of our general and administrative expenses.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Disruptions in the global financial markets, including the bankruptcy, failure, collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States and other governments and the related liquidity crisis, considerably disrupted the credit and capital markets at the end of 2008 and markets have not fully recovered since then.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In the event we need or desire additional financing, we may be unable to obtain it by borrowing money in the credit markets or raising money in the capital markets.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We face a risk of non-compliance with the financial covenants in our loan and security agreements with Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We are party to loan and security agreements with Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P24_S3	These agreements require us to maintain, among other things, a monthly specified liquidity ratio and a monthly adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, level.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P24_S4	The agreements contain customary events of default, including, among others, the failure to comply with certain covenants or other agreements.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, amounts due under the agreements may be accelerated by Silicon Valley Bank or Partners for Growth.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P24_S6	We were not in compliance with some of the financial covenants contained in our prior loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank during certain months in the year ended June 30, 2010, which Silicon Valley Bank waived and these covenants were subsequently changed in our amended and restated loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P24_S7	If we are unable to meet the financial or other covenants under the current loan and security agreements or negotiate future waivers or amendments of such covenants, events of default could occur under the agreements.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	outstanding debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to be due and payable, foreclosing on the assets securing the agreements and/or ceasing to provide additional loans, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The restrictive covenants in our loan and security agreements could limit our ability to conduct our business and respond to changing economic and business conditions and may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies that are subject to fewer restrictions.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Our loan and security agreements with Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth limit our ability to, among other things:
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The restrictive covenants under these agreements could limit our ability to obtain future financing, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The financial and restrictive covenants contained in the agreements could also adversely affect our ability to respond to changing economic and business conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies that may be subject to fewer restrictions.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Transactions that we may view as important opportunities, such as acquisitions, may be subject to the consent of Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth, which consents may be withheld or granted subject to conditions specified at the time that may affect the attractiveness or viability of the transaction.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	We do not intend to market the PAD Systems internationally in the near future, which will limit our potential revenue from these products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P26_S4	While we plan to continue to evaluate the financial viability of marketing the PAD Systems internationally, we currently do not intend to market the PAD Systems internationally in the near future in order to focus our resources and efforts on the U.S. market, as international efforts would require substantial additional sales and marketing, regulatory and personnel expenses.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Our decision to market these products only in the United States will limit our ability to reach all of our potential markets and will limit our potential sources of revenue.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P26_S6	In addition, our competitors will have an opportunity to further penetrate and achieve market share abroad until such time, if ever, that we market the PAD Systems or other products internationally.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P26_S7	We are dependent on our senior management team and highly skilled personnel, and our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain personnel necessary for our success.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P26_S8	We are highly dependent on our senior management, especially David L. Martin, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P26_S9	Our success will depend on our ability to retain senior management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, including scientists, clinicians, engineers and other highly skilled personnel and to integrate current and additional personnel in all departments.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P26_S10	Competition for senior management personnel, as well as scientists, clinical and regulatory specialists, engineers and sales personnel, is intense and we may not be able to retain our personnel.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P26_S11	The loss of members of our senior management, scientists, clinical and regulatory specialists, engineers and sales personnel could prevent us from achieving our objectives of continuing to grow the company.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P26_S12	The loss of a member of our senior management or professional staff would require the remaining senior executive officers to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P26_S13	In particular, we expect to substantially increase the size of our sales force, which will require management s attention.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P26_S14	We do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our ability to market the PAD Systems in the United States is limited to use as a therapy in patients with PAD, and if we want to expand our marketing claims, we will need to file for additional FDA clearances or approvals and conduct further clinical trials, which would be expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The PAD Systems received FDA 510(k) clearances in the United States for use as a therapy in patients with PAD.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	This general clearance restricts our ability to market or advertise the PAD Systems beyond this use and could affect our growth.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	While off-label uses of medical devices are common and the FDA does not regulate physicians choice of treatments, the FDA does restrict a manufacturer s communications regarding such off-label use.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We are not permitted to promote or advertise the PAD Systems for off-label uses.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In addition, we cannot make comparative claims regarding the use of the PAD Systems against any alternative treatments without conducting head-to-head comparative clinical trials, which would be expensive and time consuming.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P28_S3	If our promotional activities fail to comply with the FDA s regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to FDA warnings or enforcement action.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P28_S4	If we determine to market the PAD Systems in the United States for other uses, for instance, use in the coronary arteries, we would need to conduct further clinical trials and obtain premarket approval from the FDA.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P28_S5	In 2008, we completed the ORBIT I trial, a 50-patient study in India which investigated the safety of the Diamondback 360 in treating calcified coronary artery lesions, and results successfully met both safety and efficacy endpoints.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P28_S6	In May 2011, we received approval from the FDA to complete enrollment of 429 patients in our ORBIT II clinical trial for a coronary application for the Diamondback 360 , which followed the FDA s review of data from the first 50 cases in the ORBIT II trial.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Clinical trials are complex, expensive, time consuming, uncertain and subject to substantial and unanticipated delays.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Clinical trials generally involve a substantial number of patients in one or more multi-year studies.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We may encounter problems with our clinical trials, and any of those problems could cause us or the FDA to suspend those trials, or delay the analysis of the data derived from them.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P29_S3	A number of events or factors, including any of the following, could delay the completion of our clinical trials in the future and negatively impact our ability to obtain FDA clearance or approval for, and to introduce, a particular future product:
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	failure by any of our third-party contractors or investigators to comply with regulatory requirements or meet other contractual obligations in a timely manner.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our clinical trials may not begin as planned, may need to be redesigned, and may not be completed on schedule, if at all.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our future product candidates, which could limit our ability to obtain additional financing.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P30_S3	In addition, if one or more of our clinical trials is delayed, competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our future product candidates could be significantly reduced.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We may become subject to regulatory actions if we are found to have promoted the PAD Systems for unapproved uses.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, training or other activities constitute promotion of our products for unapproved uses, it could request that we cease use of or modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled or warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P31_S2	It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider promotional, training or other materials to constitute promotion of our products for an unapproved or uncleared use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P31_S3	The PAD Systems may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material regulatory deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	A government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design or labeling defects.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P32_S2	During the time of commercialization, we have had two minor instances of recall, involving a single lot of Diamondback 360 devices (eight units), and two boxes of ViperWires (ten wires), related to Use By date labeling issues.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P32_S3	In addition, a third recall, initiated in 2009 and completed in 2010, involved the ViperSheath, which is owned and manufactured by Thomas Medical Products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P32_S4	As the distributor for the ViperSheath, we were required to recall all unused units from our customers and return them to Thomas Medical Products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Any additional recalls of our products or products that we distribute would divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation with customers and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P32_S6	If we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems, our products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The PAD Systems and related manufacturing processes, clinical data, adverse events, recalls or corrections and promotional activities, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory bodies.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	In particular, we are required to comply with the FDA s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, and other regulations, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product for which we obtain marketing clearance or approval.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We are also responsible for the quality of components received by our suppliers.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Failure to comply with the QSR requirements or other statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or failure to adequately respond to any observations, could result in, among other things:
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	If any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales to suffer.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	manufacture, requires a new clearance or approval from the FDA.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	If the FDA disagrees with any determination by us that new clearance or approval is not required, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P35_S2	In addition, we could be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Regulatory clearance or approval of a product may also require costly post-marketing testing or surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as the QSR, may result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P35_S5	The use, misuse or off-label use of the PAD Systems may increase the risk of injury, which could result in product liability claims and damage to our business.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P35_S6	The use, misuse or off-label use of the PAD Systems may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The PAD Systems are not FDA-cleared or approved for treatment of the carotid arteries, the coronary arteries, within bypass grafts or stents, of thrombus or where the lesion cannot be crossed with a guidewire or a significant dissection is present at the lesion site.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We cannot prevent a physician from using the PAD Systems for off-label applications.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P36_S2	The off-label use of the PAD Systems may be more likely to result in complications that have serious consequences, including, in certain circumstances, death.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We may face risks related to product liability claims, which could exceed the limits of available insurance coverage.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	If the PAD Systems are defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contain defective components or are misused, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The medical device industry is subject to substantial litigation, and we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results or is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects to a patient.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	In most jurisdictions, producers of medical products are strictly liable for personal injuries caused by medical devices.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We may be subject in the future to claims for personal injuries arising out of the use of our products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Product liability claims could divert management s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizable damage awards against us.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P38_S4	A product liability claim against us, even if ultimately unsuccessful, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P38_S5	While we have product liability insurance coverage for our products and intend to maintain such insurance coverage in the future, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected from the claims that will be brought against us.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Compliance with environmental laws and regulations could be expensive.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Our operations are subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Although we are currently classified as a Very Small Quantity Hazardous Waste Generator within Ramsey County, Minnesota, we cannot ensure that we will maintain our licensed status as such, nor can we ensure that we will not incur material costs or liability in connection with our operations, or that our past or future operations will not result in claims or injury by employees or the public.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Environmental laws and regulations could also become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We and our distributors must comply with various federal and state anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, any breach of which could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Our relationships with physicians, hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny under various federal anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Healthcare fraud and abuse laws are complex, and even minor, inadvertent violations can give rise to claims that the relevant law has been violated.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P40_S3	If our operations are found to be in violation of these laws, we, as well as our employees, may be subject to penalties, including monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration health programs, workers compensation programs and TRICARE (the healthcare system administered by or on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense for uniformed services beneficiaries, including active duty and their dependents, retirees and their dependents), and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Individual employees may need to defend such suits on behalf of us or themselves, which could lead to significant disruption in our present and future operations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Certain states in which we intend to market our products have similar fraud and abuse laws, imposing substantial penalties for violations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P40_S6	Any government investigation or a finding of a violation of these laws would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Anti-kickback laws and regulations prohibit any knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for the referral of an individual or the ordering or recommending of the use of a product or service for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	In addition, the cost of non-compliance with these laws could be substantial, since we could be subject to monetary fines and civil or criminal penalties, and we could also be excluded from federally funded healthcare programs for non-compliance.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We have entered into consulting agreements with physicians, including some who may make referrals to us or order our products.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P41_S3	One of these physicians was one of 20 principal investigators in our OASIS clinical trial at the same time he was acting as a paid consultant for us.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P41_S4	In addition, prior to our merger with Replidyne, some of these physicians purchased our stock in arm s-length transactions on terms identical to those offered to non-physicians or received stock options from us as consideration for consulting services performed by them.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P41_S5	We believe that these consulting agreements and equity investments by physicians are common practice in our industry, and while these transactions were structured with the intention of complying with all applicable laws, including the federal ban on physician self-referrals, commonly known as the Stark Law, state anti-referral laws and other applicable anti-kickback laws, it is possible that regulatory or enforcement agencies or courts may in the future view these transactions as prohibited arrangements that must be restructured or for which we would be subject to other significant civil or criminal penalties, or prohibit us from accepting referrals from these physicians.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P41_S6	Because our strategy relies on the involvement of physicians who consult with us on the design of our product, we could be materially impacted if regulatory or enforcement agencies or courts interpret our financial relationships with our physician advisors who refer or order our products to be in violation of applicable laws and determine that we would be unable to achieve compliance with such applicable laws.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P41_S7	This could harm our reputation and the reputations of our clinical advisors.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The scope and enforcement of all of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	There can be no assurance that federal or state regulatory or enforcement authorities will not investigate or challenge our current or future activities under these laws.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Any investigation or challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Any state or federal regulatory or enforcement review of us, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time consuming.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Additionally, we cannot predict the impact of any changes in these laws, whether these changes are retroactive or will have effect on a going-forward basis only.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P43_S1	As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Market, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and compliance costs and made some activities more time consuming and costly.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P43_S5	We cannot ensure that our corporate compliance program is in compliance with or will continue to comply with all potentially applicable regulations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Moreover, if we are not able to comply with these requirements in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P44_S4	These obligations divert management s time and attention away from our business.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P44_S5	Our management may not be able to effectively and timely implement controls and procedures that adequately respond to the increased regulatory compliance and reporting requirements that are applicable.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P44_S6	If we fail to staff our accounting and finance function adequately or maintain internal controls adequate to meet the demands that are placed upon us a public company, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may be unable to report our financial results accurately or in a timely manner, and our business and stock price may suffer.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P44_S7	The costs of being a public company, as well as diversion of management s time and attention, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P44_S8	Additionally, these laws and regulations could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P44_S9	The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, board committees or as executive officers.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P44_S10	Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could allow our competitors and others to produce products based on our technology, which could substantially impair our ability to compete.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P44_S11	Our success and ability to compete depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P44_S12	We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P44_S13	As of July 31, 2011, we had a portfolio of 21 issued U.S. patents, 31 pending U.S. patent applications, 63 issued or granted non-U.S. patents, and 98 pending non-U.S. patent applications covering aspects of our core technology, which expire between 2011 and 2027.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P44_S14	However, our issued patents and related intellectual property may not be adequate to protect us or permit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope, validity or enforceability.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The scope, validity or enforceability of our issued patents can be challenged in litigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P46_S1	In addition, our pending patent applications include claims to numerous important aspects of our products under development that are not currently protected by any of our issued patents.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P46_S2	We cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	claims in our pending patent applications.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Even if any patents are issued as a result of pending patent applications, they may not provide us with significant commercial protection or be issued in a form that is advantageous to us.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Proceedings before the USPTO could result in adverse decisions as to the priority of our inventions and the narrowing or invalidation of claims in issued patents.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Further, if any patents we obtain or license are deemed invalid and unenforceable, or have their scope narrowed, it could impact our ability to commercialize or license our technology.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P47_S5	For instance, the U.S. Supreme Court has recently modified some tests used by the USPTO in granting patents during the past 20 years, which may decrease the likelihood that we will be able to obtain patents and increase the likelihood of challenge of any patents we obtain or license.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P47_S6	In addition, the U.S. Congress is now considering patent reform legislation that could transition the U.S. to a first to file system and alter the processes for challenging issued patents.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P47_S7	These reforms could increase the uncertainties surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement of our issued patents.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, if at all.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P48_S1	We may, in the future, need to assert claims of infringement against third parties to protect our intellectual property.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P48_S2	The outcome of litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in patents, copyrights, trade secrets or trademarks is highly unpredictable, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, reputation and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P48_S3	In the event of an adverse judgment, a court could hold that some or all of our asserted intellectual property rights are not infringed, invalid or unenforceable, and could order us to pay third-party attorneys fees.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Despite our efforts to safeguard our unpatented and unregistered intellectual property rights, we may not be successful in doing so or the steps taken by us in this regard may not be adequate to detect or deter misappropriation of our technology or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our products, technology or other information that we regard as proprietary.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P48_S5	In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to litigate, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P48_S6	Additionally, third parties may be able to design around our patents.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P48_S7	We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P48_S8	In this regard, we seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by having a policy that our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P48_S9	Agreements with our employees also forbid them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P48_S10	We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P48_S11	However, trade secrets are difficult to protect.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P48_S12	We cannot provide any assurance that employees and third parties will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements, or that we will be effective securing necessary assignments from these third parties.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties might copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Finally, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and this would prevent us from asserting any such trade secret rights against these parties.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P49_S4	Claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others could prohibit us from commercializing products, require us to obtain licenses from third parties or require us to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages and injunctive relief.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The medical technology industry is characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	All issued patents are entitled to a presumption of validity under the laws of the United States.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Therefore, we cannot be certain that we have not infringed the intellectual property rights of such third parties or others.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our competitors may assert that our products are covered by U.S. or foreign patents held by them.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We are aware of numerous patents issued to third parties that relate to the manufacture and use of medical devices for interventional cardiology.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The owners of each of these patents could assert that the manufacture, use or sale of our products infringes one or more claims of their patents.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Because patent applications may take years to issue, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that we infringe.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P55_S1	If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the United States.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P55_S2	The costs of these proceedings can be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful if unbeknownst to us, the other party had independently arrived at the same or similar invention prior to our own invention, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P55_S3	There could also be existing patents of which we are unaware that one or more aspects of our technology may inadvertently infringe.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P55_S4	In some cases, litigation may be threatened or brought by a patent-holding company or other adverse patent owner who has no relevant product revenues and against whom our patents may provide little or no deterrence.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P55_S5	Any infringement or misappropriation claim could cause us to incur significant costs, place significant strain on our financial resources, divert management s attention from our business and harm our reputation.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P55_S6	Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P55_S7	In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Although patent and intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S1	If the relevant patents were upheld in litigation as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe, we could be prohibited from commercializing any infringing products unless we could obtain licenses to use the technology covered by the patent or are able to design around the patent.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S2	We may be unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may not be able to redesign any infringing products to avoid infringement.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Further, any redesign may not receive FDA clearance or approval or may not receive such clearance or approval in a timely manner.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Any such license could impair operating margins on future product revenue.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S5	A court could also order us to pay compensatory damages for such infringement, and potentially treble damages, plus prejudgment interest and third-party attorneys fees.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S6	These damages could be substantial and could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S7	A court also could enter orders that temporarily, preliminarily or permanently enjoin us and our customers from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing infringing products, or could enter an order mandating that we undertake certain remedial activities.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S8	Depending on the nature of the relief ordered by the court, we could become liable for additional damages to third parties.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S9	Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products, which would have a significant adverse impact on our business.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S10	Our stock price is volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S11	The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S12	Market prices for securities of early-stage pharmaceutical, medical device, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S13	Our common stock traded as low as $3.75 and as high as $15.72 per share during the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S14	In addition to the risk factors described in this section, factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P57_S1	In addition, if securities class action litigation is initiated against us, we would incur substantial costs and our management s attention would be diverted from operations.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P57_S2	All of these factors could cause the price of our stock to decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Moreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P57_S4	These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against such company.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P58_S2	We do not expect to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future, and accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment in the company.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P58_S3	We anticipate that we will retain our earnings, if any, for future growth and therefore do not anticipate that we will pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P58_S4	As a result, appreciation of the price of our common stock is the only potential source of return to stockholders.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P58_S5	Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P58_S6	If equity research analysts cease to publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable research or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P58_S7	Investors look to reports of equity research analysts for additional information regarding our industry and operations and rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P58_S8	We do not control these analysts.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P58_S9	Equity research analysts may elect to cease research coverage of our common stock, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P58_S10	The price of our common stock could decline if one or more of these analysts downgrade the common stock or if they issue other unfavorable commentary about us or our business.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P58_S11	Some provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P58_S12	Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	authorizing the issuance of, without stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock that could adversely affect the rights and powers of the holders of our common stock.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P59_S1	In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by such corporation s board of directors.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P59_S2	This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P59_S4	Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of the common stock.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P60_S1	To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, including in a debt financing where we issue convertible notes or notes with warrants, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We may sell common stock in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P61_S1	If we sell common stock in more than one transaction, existing stockholders may be materially diluted.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P61_S2	In addition, new investors could gain rights superior to existing stockholders, such as liquidation and other preferences.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We have stock options and warrants outstanding to purchase shares of our capital stock.
1180145_11_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Our stockholders will incur dilution upon exercise of any outstanding stock options or warrants.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	leased this facility through November 2012 with an option to renew through November 2017.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	This facility accommodates our research and development, sales, marketing, manufacturing, finance and administrative activities.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	In September 2009, we entered into an agreement to lease a 46,000 square foot production facility in Pearland, Texas beginning on April 1, 2010.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P0_S3	We have leased this facility through March 2020.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P0_S4	This facility primarily accommodates additional manufacturing activities.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P0_S5	We believe that our current premises are substantially adequate for our current and anticipated future needs for the foreseeable future.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	Dr. Leonid Shturman Claim On October 27, 2009, Dr. Leonid Shturman, CSI-MN s founder, filed a complaint (the First Complaint ) in the U.S. District Court in Minnesota (the Court ) against us.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	The First Complaint asserted that our filing of an action in Switzerland against Dr. Shturman violated provisions of a settlement agreement that we and Dr. Shturman entered into in September 2008.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P1_S2	The 2008 settlement resolved a lawsuit we had brought against Dr. Shturman for breach of his employment agreement with us.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P1_S3	Dr. Shturman s complaint sought an award of damages and injunctive relief to bar us from litigating the action in Switzerland.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P1_S4	Dr. Shturman died subsequent to the filing of the complaint.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	Within three months of Dr. Shturman s death, demands for settlement were made on behalf of the sole heir of Dr. Shturman s estate, his wife, Leila Nadirashvili ( Mrs. Shturman ).
1180145_11_ITEM2_P2_S1	We declined Mrs. Shturman s demands.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P2_S2	Thereafter, there was no activity for approximately nine months.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P3_S0	Earlier this year, the Court issued an order requesting counsel for Dr. Shturman to advise the Court regarding the status of the First Complaint.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P4_S0	Subsequent to the Court s order, Mrs. Shturman again began making demands for money in exchange for Dr. Shturman s alleged patent portfolio.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P4_S1	We again declined Mrs. Shturman s demands but instead made our own offer of settlement.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P4_S2	Counsel for Mrs. Shturman rejected the offer and instead informed us that they intend to file an amended complaint in the U.S. District Court in Minnesota.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P5_S0	On August 24, 2011, instead of filing an amended complaint, Mrs. Shturman filed a second complaint in federal court seeking a declaration regarding ownership of the patent portfolio that she claims belongs to Dr. Shturman, slander by us of title to patent rights, tortious interference with prospective business relations, breach of settlement contract, and statutory unfair competition.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P5_S1	Also, Mrs. Shturman filed a motion to be substituted in the First Complaint.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P6_S0	We intend to file a motion in opposition to Mrs. Shturman s motion to be substituted to have the First Complaint dismissed.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P6_S1	In addition, Mrs. Shturman filed a writ to dismiss our Switzerland lawsuit based on res judicata and collateral estoppel, alleging that the claims in Switzerland are identical to the previously dismissed lawsuit in Minnesota.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P6_S2	Our counsel in Switzerland has filed a response to the motion to dismiss stating that the claims in Switzerland are not subject to res judicata.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P6_S3	In particular, we reserved the rights in the previously dismissed Minnesota lawsuit to assert claims to an invention included in the patents filed in Switzerland by Dr. Shturman.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P7_S0	On July 18, 2011, we received a demand letter from legal counsel for Michael Kallok, a former officer, director and consultant to us, claiming that Mr. Kallok is entitled to 42,594 shares of our common stock or, alternatively, the value of those shares as of July 15, 2011, which was $610,798.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P7_S1	Mr. Kallok asserts that we improperly deemed such shares forfeited under a restricted stock agreement with Mr. Kallok.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P7_S2	This matter is proceeding to arbitration.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P7_S3	We are defending this claim vigorously, and believe that an adverse outcome of this dispute would not have a materially adverse effect on our business, operations, cash flows or financial condition.
1180145_11_ITEM2_P7_S4	We have not recognized any expense related to the settlement of this matter as we believe an adverse outcome of this action is not probable.

1180145_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	At the closing of the merger, Replidyne s net assets, as calculated pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, were approximately $36.6 million as adjusted.

1180145_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	Since 1997, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development of the PAD Systems.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	From 2003 to 2005, we conducted numerous bench and animal tests in preparation for application submissions to the FDA.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P5_S4	We initially focused our testing on providing a solution for coronary in-stent restenosis, but later changed the focus to PAD.

1180145_11_ITEM7_P5_S13	As of June 30, 2011, we had an accumulated deficit of $162.4 million.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P5_S14	We expect our losses to continue but generally decline as revenue grows from continued commercialization activities, development of additional product enhancements, accumulation of clinical data on our products, and further regulatory submissions.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P5_S15	To date, we have financed our operations primarily from the issuance of common and preferred stock, convertible promissory notes, and debt.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P5_S16	We derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of PAD Systems and other ancillary products.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	The PAD Systems each use a disposable, single-use, low-profile catheter that travels over our proprietary ViperWire guidewire.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	The Diamondback 360 and Predator 360 PAD Systems use an external control unit that powers the system, while the Stealth 360 PAD System uses a saline infusion pump as a power supply for the operation of the catheter.

1180145_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	Interest expense results from outstanding debt balances, and debt premium and discount amortization.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Interest income is attributed to interest earned on deposits in investments that consist of money market funds.

1180145_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	Decretion was recorded as a decrease to redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants in the consolidated balance sheet and a decrease to net loss in the consolidated statement of operations.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P14_S3	Concurrent with the merger, all preferred stock warrants were converted into warrants to purchase common stock and, accordingly, we stopped recording decretion as of the merger date.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Gain on investments reflects the change in the fair value of investments.

1180145_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	Decretion (accretion) was recorded as a decrease (increase) to redeemable convertible preferred stock in the consolidated balance sheet and a decrease (increase) to the loss attributable to common stockholders in the consolidated statement of operations.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P16_S3	The redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger with Replidyne.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P16_S4	As such, the preferred stockholders forfeited their liquidation preferences and we stopped recording decretion (accretion) as of the merger date.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	We have established valuation allowances to fully offset our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty about our ability to generate the future taxable income necessary to realize these deferred assets, particularly in light of our historical losses.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Section 382 due to significant ownership changes (as defined in Section 382) resulting from our equity financings.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	At June 30, 2011, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax reporting purposes of approximately $146.2 million, which will expire at various dates through fiscal 2031.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect amounts reported in those statements.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	Our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, excess and obsolete inventory, debt conversion option, stock-based compensation, and preferred stock warrants are updated as appropriate at least quarterly.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	We use authoritative pronouncements, our technical accounting knowledge, cumulative business experience, judgment and other factors in the selection and application of our accounting policies.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P19_S4	While we believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments that we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements are appropriate, these estimates, assumptions and judgments are subject to factors and uncertainties regarding their outcome.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P19_S5	Therefore, actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Some of our significant accounting policies require us to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	We believe that the following are our critical accounting policies and estimates: Revenue Recognition.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	We sell the majority of our products via direct shipment to hospitals or clinics.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	These criteria are generally met at the time of delivery when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	We record estimated sales returns, discounts and rebates as a reduction of net sales in the same period revenue is recognized.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	Costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	Cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P22_S4	This allowance is an estimate and is regularly evaluated for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience, credit quality of the customer base, age of the receivable balances, both individually and in the aggregate, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P22_S5	Provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts attributed to bad debt are recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	We have inventories that are principally comprised of capitalized direct labor and manufacturing overhead, raw materials and components, and finished goods.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	Due to the technological nature of our products, there is a risk of obsolescence to changes in our technology and the market, which is impacted by technological developments and events.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	Accordingly, we write down our inventories as we become aware of any situation where the carrying amount exceeds the estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future demands and market conditions.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	The evaluation includes analyses of inventory levels, expected product lives, product at risk of expiration, sales levels by product and projections of future sales demand.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P23_S4	The fair value of the conversion option is related to the loan and security agreement with Partners for Growth and has been included as a component of debt conversion option and other assets on our balance sheet.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P23_S5	The Monte Carlo option pricing model used to determine the value of the conversion option included various inputs including historical volatility, stock price simulations, and the assessed behavior of us and Partners for Growth based on those simulations.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	We recognize stock-based compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments computed at the date of grant.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	The fair value of all stock option and restricted stock awards and units are expensed in the consolidated statements of operations over the related vesting period.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	We calculate the fair value on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	To determine the inputs for the Black-Scholes option pricing model, we are required to develop several assumptions, which are highly subjective.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Prior to the consummation of the merger, we used comparable public company data to determine volatility for option grants.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	Expected volatility is now based on the historical volatility of our stock.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	We use a weighted average calculation to estimate the time our options will be outstanding.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	We estimated the number of options that are expected to be forfeited based on our historical experience.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	We use our judgment and expectations in setting future dividend rates, which is currently expected to be zero.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	All options we have granted become exercisable over periods established at the date of grant.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	The option exercise price is generally not less than the estimated fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant, as determined by management and the board of directors.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P30_S3	The absence of an active market for our common stock prior to the merger required our management and board of directors to estimate the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting options and for determining stock-based compensation expense.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P30_S4	In response to these requirements, prior to the merger our management and board of directors estimated the fair market value of common stock at each date at which options are granted based upon stock valuations and other qualitative factors.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P30_S5	Our management and board of directors conducted stock valuations using two different valuation methods: the option pricing method and the probability weighted expected return method.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P30_S6	Both of these valuation methods took into consideration the following factors: financing activity, rights and preferences of our preferred stock, growth of the executive management team, clinical trial activity, the FDA process, the status of our commercial launch, our mergers and acquisitions and public offering processes, revenues, the valuations of comparable public companies, our cash and working capital amounts, and additional objective and subjective factors relating to our business.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P30_S7	Our management and board of directors set the exercise prices for option grants based upon their best estimate of the fair market value of the common stock at the time they made such grants, taking into account all information available at those times.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P30_S8	In some cases, management and the board of directors made retrospective assessments of the valuation of the common stock at later dates and determined that the fair market value of the common stock at the times the grants were made was different than the exercise prices established for those grants.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P30_S9	In cases in which the fair market was higher than the exercise price, we recognized stock-based compensation expense for the excess of the fair market value of the common stock over the exercise price.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Following the merger, our stock valuations are based upon the market price for our common stock.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	In accordance with FASB guidance, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements related to legal proceedings when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	If a loss is possible, but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P32_S3	In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P32_S4	Our significant legal proceedings are discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands), and, for certain line items, the changes between the specified periods expressed as percent increases or decreases: Comparison of Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2011 with Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2010 Revenues.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Revenues increased by $14.0 million, or 21.5%, from $64.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2010 to $78.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	This increase was attributable to an $11.5 million, or 20.1%, increase in sales of PAD Systems and a $2.4 million, or 32.0%, increase in sales of supplemental and other revenue during the year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the year ended June 30, 2010.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	Supplemental products include our Viper product line and distribution partner products.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	Currently, all of our revenues are in the United States; however, we may potentially sell internationally in the future.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	We expect our revenue to increase as we continue to increase the number of physicians using the devices, and increase the usage per physician as we continue to focus on physician education programs, introduce new and improved products, and generate clinical data.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P35_S3	Cost of goods sold increased by $1.3 million, or 8.5%, from $15.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2010 to $16.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P35_S4	These amounts represent the cost of materials, labor and overhead for single-use catheters, guidewires, control units, pumps, and other supplemental products.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P35_S5	The increase in gross margin from 76.9% during the year ended June 30, 2010 to 79.3% for the year ended June 30, 2011 was primarily due to operating efficiencies, product cost reductions, and a favorable product mix resulting in a reduction in shipments of lower margin control units.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P35_S6	Cost of goods sold for the years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 includes $312,000 and $548,000, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P35_S7	We expect that gross margin will slightly decline in the first half of fiscal 2012 due to Stealth 360 becoming a higher percentage of revenue, as the Stealth 360 has higher unit costs compared to the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 due to lower production volumes.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P35_S8	In addition, we expect the ramp-up of our second manufacturing facility in Texas, with higher future production capacity, will temporarily increase production costs but enhance efficiencies over time.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P35_S9	We expect that gross margin in the second half of fiscal 2012 will be fairly consistent with fiscal 2011, although quarterly fluctuations could occur based on production volumes, timing of new product introductions, sales mix, pricing changes, or other unanticipated circumstances.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses .
1180145_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	Selling, general, and administrative expense was $62.4 million for the years ended June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	the year ended June 30, 2011 have increased due to building our sales organization, along with increased professional fees offset by lower stock-based compensation.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 includes $5.6 million and $7.3 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in the future due primarily to the costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing organization and programs to further commercialize our products, but at an annual rate less than revenue growth.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P37_S3	Research and development expenses decreased by $1.4 million, or 13.0%, from $10.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2010 to $8.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P37_S4	Research and development expenses relate to specific projects to improve our product or expand into new markets, such as the development of electric versions of the PAD Systems, shaft designs, crown designs, and PAD and coronary clinical trials.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P37_S5	The reduction in these expenses related to the decreased numbers and sizes of PAD development projects in fiscal 2011, as well as the timing of those projects.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P37_S6	Research and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 includes $587,000 and $1.3 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P37_S7	As we continue to expand our product portfolio within the market for the treatment of peripheral arteries and leverage our core technology into the coronary market, we generally expect to incur research and development expenses above amounts incurred for the year ended June 30, 2011; however, we expect these expenses to remain fairly consistent as a percentage of revenue.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P37_S8	Fluctuations could occur based on the number of projects and studies and the timing of expenditures.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P37_S9	Interest and other income (expense) decreased by $1.3 million, or 130.4%, from ($1.0) million for the year ended June 30, 2010 to ($2.3) million for the year ended June 30, 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P37_S10	Significant changes in interest and other income (expense) during these periods included:
1180145_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	Change in Fair Value of Conversion Option.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	Change in fair value of conversion option was $491,000 for the year ended June 30, 2011, which was primarily driven by an increase in the market value of our common stock since the convertible debt issuance date.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	There was no change in fair value of the conversion option during the year ended June 30, 2010.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P38_S3	The change in the fair value of the conversion option represents the period to period change in fair value of the conversion option associated with outstanding convertible debt.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Net Write-offs Upon Conversion (Option and Unamortized Premium or Discount).
1180145_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	Net write-offs upon conversion was $(1.4) million during the year ended June 30, 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	There were no net write-offs upon conversion during the year ended June 30, 2010.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Net write-offs upon conversion are the result of the conversion of convertible debt, and include the write-off of the conversion option and any unamortized debt premium or discount.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Net Loss Available to Common Stockholders.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	Net loss available to common stockholders for the year ended June 30, 2011 was ($11.1) million, or ($0.70) per basic and diluted share, compared to ($23.9) million, or ($1.62) per basic and diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2010.

1180145_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	This increase was attributable to a $6.1 million, or 11.8%, increase in sales of PAD Systems and a $2.3 million, or 45.0%, increase in sales of supplemental and other revenue during the year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the year ended June 30, 2009.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Supplemental products include our Viper product line and distribution partner products, some of which have been introduced over the last year.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	All of our revenues were in the United States.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P43_S2	Cost of goods sold decreased by $1.2 million, or 7.4%, from $16.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2009 to $15.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2010.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	resulted in an increase to gross margin of six percentage points, from 71% for the year ended June 30, 2009 to 77% for the year ended June 30, 2010.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	These amounts represent the cost of materials, labor and overhead for single-use catheters, guidewires, control units, and other supplemental products.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	The increase in gross margin from the year ended June 30, 2009 to June 30, 2010 was primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies, product cost reductions, and a favorable product mix resulting in a reduction in shipments of lower margin control units.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P44_S3	Cost of goods sold for the years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 includes $548,000 and $475,000, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P44_S4	Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $2.6 million, or 4.4%, from $59.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2009 to $62.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2010.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P44_S5	The primary reasons for the increase included increased sales and marketing expenses of $4.8 million from building our sales organization along with additional education programs, partially offset by reduced consulting and professional services, primarily from a $1.7 million write-off of previously capitalized initial public offering costs in fiscal 2009.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P44_S6	Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 includes $7.3 million and $5.7 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation.

1180145_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	The decrease was due to $2.8 million recorded during the year ended June 30, 2009 related to accepting the UBS offer to repurchase our auction rate securities, establishing an auction rate securities put option agreement.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	Decretion of Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	Decretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants reflects the change in estimated fair value of preferred stock warrants at the balance sheet dates.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	Decretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants for the year ended June 30, 2009 was $3.0 million.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P46_S3	There was no decretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants during the year ended June 30, 2010 because all preferred stock was converted to common stock in conjunction with the merger.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	Gain ( impairment) on investments was $150,000 and ($1.7) million for the years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	Gain (impairment) on investments was due to the change in the fair value of auction rate securities investments in both periods.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	On June 30, 2010, all the auction rate securities had been redeemed by the issuers at par value or repurchased by UBS at par value pursuant to an agreement reached with UBS in 2008.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	Due to the redemption and repurchase, there is no gain (impairment) on investments related to these securities in subsequent periods.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	Decretion of Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	Decretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock reflected the change in estimated fair value of preferred stock at the balance sheet dates.

1180145_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	Net loss available to common stockholders for year ended June 30, 2010 was $(23.9) million, or ($1.62) per basic and diluted share, compared to $(9.1) million, or ($1.13) per basic and diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2009.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION To supplement our consolidated condensed financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, our management uses a non-GAAP financial measure referred to as Adjusted EBITDA.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands):
1180145_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA of $11.6 million, or 87.7%, is primarily the result of the $14.1 million, or 61.5%, improvement in the loss from operations.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	The loss from operations was significantly impacted by increases in revenue and gross margin, and a decrease in operating expenses, as discussed above.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	Adjusted EBITDA was also impacted by a decrease in stock-based compensation and increase in depreciation and amortization.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P52_S3	Stock-based compensation decreased $2.6 million, or 28.9%, from $9.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2010 to $6.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P52_S4	Stock-based compensation decreased as a result of prior year charges for extending the terms of certain expired stock options.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P52_S5	Depreciation and amortization increased as a result of additional investment in capital equipment.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P52_S6	We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of performance and believe this measure facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by factoring out potential differences caused by depreciation and amortization expense and non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P52_S7	Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA to analyze the underlying trends in our business, assess the performance of our core operations, establish operational goals and forecasts that are used to allocate resources and evaluate our performance period over period and in relation to our competitors operating results.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P52_S8	Additionally, our management is partially evaluated on the basis of Adjusted EBITDA when determining achievement of their incentive compensation performance targets.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P52_S9	We believe that presenting Adjusted EBITDA provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P52_S10	We also believe that providing this information better enables our investors to understand our operating performance and evaluate the methodology used by our management to evaluate and measure such performance.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P52_S11	Adjusted EBITDA is also used to measure performance in our financial covenants as required by Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P52_S12	The following is an explanation of each of the items that management excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and the reasons for excluding each of these individual items:
1180145_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP financial measures primarily because such expense, while constituting an ongoing and recurring expense, is not an expense that requires cash settlement.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	Our management also believes that excluding this item from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand its impact on our operational performance, liquidity and ability to make additional investments in the company, and it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	We exclude depreciation and amortization expense from our non-GAAP financial measures primarily because such expenses, while constituting ongoing and recurring expenses, are not expenses that require cash settlement and are not used by our management to assess the core profitability of our business operations.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	Our management also believes that excluding these items from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand our operational performance, liquidity and ability to make additional investments in the company.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P54_S2	Material Limitations Associated with the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Manner in which We Compensate for these Limitations Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P54_S3	Some of the limitations associated with our use of these non-GAAP financial measures are:
1180145_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	Items such as stock-based compensation do not directly affect our cash flow position; however, such items reflect economic costs to us and are not reflected in our Adjusted EBITDA and therefore these non-GAAP measures do not reflect the full economic effect of these items.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore other companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	Our management exercises judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures we use.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily upon our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	We had cash and cash equivalents of $21.2 million and $23.7 million at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P57_S3	During the year ended June 30, 2011, net cash used in operations amounted to $8.4 million.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P57_S4	As of June 30, 2011, we had an accumulated deficit of $162.4 million.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P57_S5	We have historically funded our operating losses primarily from the issuance of common and preferred stock, convertible promissory notes, debt, and the merger with Replidyne in February 2009.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank On March 29, 2010, we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	The agreement includes a $10.0 million term loan and a $15.0 million line of credit.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	The terms of each of these loans are as follows:
1180145_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	The $10.0 million term loan has a fixed interest rate of 9.0% and a final payment amount equal to 1.0% of the loan amount due at maturity.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	This term loan has a 36 month maturity, with repayment terms that include interest only payments during the first six months followed by 30 equal principal and interest payments.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	This term loan also includes an acceleration provision that requires us to pay the entire outstanding balance, plus a penalty ranging from 1.0% to 3.0% of the principal amount, upon prepayment or the occurrence and continuance of an event of default.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	In connection with entering into the agreement, we amended a warrant previously granted to Silicon Valley Bank.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	The warrant provided an option to purchase 8,493 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.48 per share.

1180145_11_ITEM7_P60_S3	The balance outstanding on the term loan at June 30, 2011 was $7.3 million, net of the unamortized discount associated with the warrant.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	The $15.0 million line of credit has a two year maturity and a floating interest rate equal to Silicon Valley Bank s prime rate, plus 2.0%, with an interest rate floor of 6.0%.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	Interest on borrowings is due monthly and the principal balance is due at maturity.

1180145_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	The agreement provides that initially 50% of the outstanding principal balance of the $10.0 million term loan reduces available borrowings under the line of credit.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	Upon the achievement of certain financial covenants, the amount reducing available borrowings will be reduced to zero.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P63_S2	There was not an outstanding balance on the line of credit at June 30, 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	Borrowings from Silicon Valley Bank are secured by all of our assets.

1180145_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of June 30, 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P64_S3	The agreement also includes subjective acceleration clauses which permit Silicon Valley Bank to accelerate the due date under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, material adverse effects on our financial status or otherwise.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P64_S4	Any non-compliance by us under the terms of our debt arrangements could result in an event of default under the Silicon Valley Bank loan, which, if not cured, could result in the acceleration of this debt.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	Loan and Security Agreement with Partners for Growth On April 14, 2010, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Partners for Growth III, L.P. (PFG).
1180145_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	The agreement provides that PFG will make loans to us up to $4.0 million.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	The agreement has a maturity date of April 14, 2015.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P65_S3	The loans bear interest at a floating per annum rate equal to 2.75% above Silicon Valley Bank s prime rate, and such interest is payable monthly.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P65_S4	The principal balance of and any accrued and unpaid interest on any notes are due on the maturity date and may not be prepaid by us at any time in whole or in part.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P65_S5	Under the agreement, PFG provided us with an initial loan of $1.5 million (the initial loan ) on April 15, 2010.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P65_S6	During the three months ended December 31, 2010, PFG, at its option, converted the entire $1.5 million (at par) into 276,243 shares of our common stock in accordance with the conversion terms set forth in the note for the initial loan.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P65_S7	On December 3, 2010, and January 26, 2011, we issued PFG additional convertible notes under the agreement of $3.5 million and $500,000, respectively ( subsequent loans ).
1180145_11_ITEM7_P65_S8	During the three months ended June 30, 2011, PFG, at its option, converted the $3.5 million subsequent loan (at par) into 362,320 shares of our common stock in accordance with the conversion terms set forth in the note for the subsequent loan.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P65_S9	On June 30, 2011, we issued PFG an additional convertible note under the agreement of $3.5 million (the current loans ).
1180145_11_ITEM7_P65_S10	At any time prior to the maturity date, PFG may at its option convert the remaining $500,000 subsequent loan or the $3.5 million current loan into shares of our common stock at $12.40 or $13.64 per share, respectively, which equaled the ten-day volume weighted average price per share of our common stock prior to the issuance date of each note.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P65_S11	We may also effect at any time a mandatory conversion of amounts, subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations provided in the agreement, including a requirement that the ten-day volume weighted average price of our common stock prior to the date of conversion is at least 15% greater than the conversion price.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P65_S12	We may reduce the conversion price to a price that represents a 15% discount to the ten-day volume weighted average price of its common stock to satisfy this condition and effect a mandatory conversion.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	As a result of the various note issuances and conversions, we have reflected a net expense of $859,000 for the year ended June 30, 2011 as a component of interest and other, net on the accompanying statement of operations which represents the net effect of (i) the write-off of the conversion option on the initial loan and subsequent loan, (ii) the write-off of the unamortized debt premium on the initial and subsequent loan and (iii) the change in fair value of the conversion options on all loans.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	The balance outstanding under the loan and security agreement at June 30, 2011 was $4.6 million, including the net unamortized premium associated with our conversion option and related beneficial conversion feature.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P66_S2	The balance outstanding under the loan and security agreement at June 30, 2010 was $1.3 million, including the net unamortized discount associated with the warrant and our conversion option.

1180145_11_ITEM7_P66_S4	We then subsequently issued PFG a new convertible note of $500,000.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P66_S5	At any time prior to the maturity date, PFG may at its option convert the $500,000 note into shares of our common stock at $15.30 per share, which equaled the ten-day volume weighted average price per share of our common stock prior to the issuance date of the note.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	On August 23, 2011, the loan and security agreement was amended.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	The amended agreement provides that PFG will make loans to us up to $5.0 million.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P67_S2	All other terms of the original agreement remain the same.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P67_S3	We then subsequently issued PFG a new convertible note of $1.0 million, which increased the aggregate amount drawn under the loan and security agreement, as amended, to the full available amount of $5.0 million.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P67_S4	At any time prior to the maturity date, PFG may at its option convert the $1.0 million note into shares of our common stock at $13.42 per share, which equaled the ten-day volume weighted average price per share of our common stock prior to the issuance date of the note.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P67_S5	The loans are secured by certain assets, and the agreement contains customary covenants limiting the our ability to, among other things, incur debt or liens, make certain investments and loans, effect certain redemptions of and declare and pay certain dividends on our stock, permit or suffer certain change of control transactions, dispose of collateral, or change the nature of our business.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P67_S6	In addition, the PFG loan and security agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain certain liquidity and fixed charge coverage ratios, and certain three-month EBITDA targets.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P67_S7	We were in compliance with all financial covenants at June 30, 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P67_S8	If we do not comply with the various covenants, PFG may, subject to various customary cure rights, decline to provide additional loans, require amortization of the loan over its remaining term, or require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the loan and foreclose on any or all collateral, depending on which financial covenants are not maintained.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	In connection with the execution of the PFG loan and security agreement, we issued a warrant to PFG on April 14, 2010, which allows PFG to purchase 147,330 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $5.43, which price was based on the ten-day volume weighted average price per share of our common stock prior to the date of the agreement.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	The warrant was exercised in June 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P68_S2	Cash and cash equivalents was $21.2 million and $23.7 million at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P68_S3	This decrease is primarily attributable net cash used in operations during the year ended June 30, 2011, partially offset by proceeds drawn on our convertible debt agreement.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P68_S4	Net cash used in operating activities improved 38.4% to $8.4 million from $13.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P68_S5	For the years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, we had a net loss of $11.1 million and $23.9 million, respectively.

1180145_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	For the year ended June 30, 2010, cash provided by accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily due to receipt of $3.5 million in net cash incentives under the agreement to establish a manufacturing facility in Texas.

1180145_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including the extent and duration of future operating losses, the level and timing of future sales and expenditures, the results and scope of ongoing research and product development programs, working capital required to support our sales growth, the receipt of and time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals, our sales and marketing programs, the continuing acceptance of our products in the marketplace, competing technologies and market and regulatory developments.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	As of June 30, 2011, we believe our current cash and cash equivalents and available debt will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and operations for at least the next 12 months.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P72_S2	We intend to retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.
1180145_11_ITEM7_P72_S3	We may raise additional capital in the future, to fund acceleration of our current growth initiatives or additional growth opportunities, if we believe it will significantly enhance our value.

1180145_11_ITEM7_P77_S3	The new guidance will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2012.

1180145_11_ITEM8_P0_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

1180145_11_ITEM8_P0_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P0_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P0_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

1180145_11_ITEM8_P0_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P1_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P1_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1180145_11_ITEM8_P13_S3	This allowance is an estimate and is regularly evaluated by the Company for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience, credit quality of the customer base, age of the receivable balances, both individually and in the aggregate, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P13_S4	Provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts attributed to bad debt are recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P13_S5	The following table shows allowance for doubtful accounts activity for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010:
1180145_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method of valuation.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	The establishment of inventory allowances for excess and obsolete inventories is based on estimated exposure on specific inventory items.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P15_S1	Property and Equipment Property and equipment is carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P15_S2	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of five years for production equipment and furniture and fixtures; three years for computer equipment and software; and the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term for leasehold improvements.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P15_S3	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs and minor renewals and betterments which do not extend or improve the life of the respective assets are expensed as incurred.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P15_S4	All other expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P15_S5	The assets and related depreciation accounts are adjusted for property retirements and disposals with the resulting gains or losses included in the consolidated statement of operations.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	The capitalized costs incurred to obtain patents are amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P16_S1	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	The recoverability of capitalized patent costs is dependent upon the Company s ability to derive revenue-producing products from such patents or the ultimate sale or licensing of such patent rights.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P17_S1	Patents that are abandoned are written off at the time of abandonment.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P18_S1	The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated by the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company leases manufacturing and office space under operating lease agreements.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P19_S1	The leases contain rent escalation clauses for which the lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases.

1180145_11_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P20_S2	These criteria are generally met at the time of delivery when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company records estimated sales returns, discounts and rebates as a reduction of net sales in the same period revenue is recognized.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P21_S1	Costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized.

1180145_11_ITEM8_P21_S5	Warranty reserve, provisions and claims for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P22_S1	Developing a provision for income taxes, including the effective tax rate and the analysis of potential tax exposure items, if any, requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws, regulations and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P22_S2	The Company s judgment and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	Existing accounting guidance requires that accounting for uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in the financial statements.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P23_S1	The guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P23_S2	Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P23_S3	The guidance also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.

1180145_11_ITEM8_P24_S3	Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	The Company maintains its cash and investment balances primarily with one financial institution.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P25_S2	At times, these balances exceed federally insured limits.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P25_S3	The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in cash and cash equivalents.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments Under the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	The authoritative guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P27_S1	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	The categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	The following table sets forth the fair value of the Company s financial instruments that were measured on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2011.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P29_S1	Assets are measured on a recurring basis if they are remeasured at least annually:
1180145_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	The fair value of the conversion option is related to the loan and security agreement with Partners for Growth (described in Note 3) and has been included as a component of debt conversion option and other assets on the accompanying balance sheet.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P30_S1	The Monte Carlo option pricing model used to determine the value of the conversion option included various inputs including historical volatility, stock price simulations, and assessed behavior of the Company and Partners for Growth based on those simulations.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P30_S2	Based upon these inputs, the Company considers the conversion option to be a Level 3 investment.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P30_S3	As of June 30, 2011, the Company believes that the carrying amounts of its other financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P30_S4	The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value based on interest rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	The preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P31_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments computed at the date of grant.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P32_S1	The fair value of all stock option and restricted stock awards are expensed in the consolidated statements of operations ratably over the related vesting period.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P32_S2	The Company calculates the fair value on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P32_S3	Preferred Stock Prior to the merger, the Company recorded the current estimated fair value of its convertible preferred stock on a quarterly basis based on the fair market value of that stock as determined by management and the board of directors.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	stock rights and preferences, clinical trials, revenues, and regulatory approval process.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P33_S1	The Company recorded changes in the fair value of its redeemable convertible preferred stock in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity (deficiency) and comprehensive loss and consolidated statements of operations as accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P33_S2	Concurrent with the merger, all preferred stock was converted to common stock and, accordingly, was reclassified to stockholders equity (deficiency).
1180145_11_ITEM8_P33_S3	The freestanding warrant that was related to the Company s redeemable convertible preferred stock was classified as a liability on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2008.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P33_S4	The warrant was subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value was recognized as a component of other income (expense).
1180145_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	Fair value was measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P34_S1	Concurrent with the merger, all preferred stock warrants were converted into warrants to purchase common stock and, accordingly, the liability was reclassified to stockholders equity (deficiency).
1180145_11_ITEM8_P34_S2	Certain reclassifications have been made to the June 30, 2010 balance sheet to conform to June 30, 2011 presentation.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P34_S3	These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net loss, stockholders equity, or cash flows as previously reported.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements on fair value measurements.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	The new guidance limits the highest-and-best-use measure to nonfinancial assets, permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis, and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P35_S2	Additionally, the new guidance expands the disclosures on Level 3 inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions, as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P35_S3	The new guidance will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2012.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P35_S4	Other than requiring additional disclosures, the Company does not anticipate material impacts on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P35_S5	In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance requiring that all non-owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P35_S6	In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income, and the total of comprehensive income.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P35_S7	The new guidance will be effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2012.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P35_S8	Other than requiring additional disclosures, the Company does not anticipate material impacts on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	As of June 30, 2011, future estimated amortization of patents and patent licenses will be:
1180145_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	This future amortization expense is an estimate.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P37_S1	Actual amounts may vary from these estimated amounts due to additional intangible asset acquisitions, potential impairment, accelerated amortization or other events.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank On March 29, 2010, the Company entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank.

1180145_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	The agreement provides that initially 50% of the outstanding principal balance of the $10,000 term loan reduces available borrowings under the line of credit.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P43_S1	Upon the achievement of certain financial covenants, the amount reducing available borrowings will be reduced to zero.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P43_S2	There was no outstanding balance on the line of credit at June 30, 2011 or 2010.

1180145_11_ITEM8_P45_S12	The Company may reduce the conversion price to a price that represents a 15% discount to the ten-day volume weighted average price of its common stock to satisfy this condition and effect a mandatory conversion.
1180145_11_ITEM8_P45_S13	As a result of the various note issuances and conversions, the Company has reflected a net expense of $859 for the year ended June 30, 2011 as a component of interest and other, net on the accompanying statement of operations, which represents the net effect of (i) the write-off of the conversion option on the initial loan and subsequent loan, (ii) the write-off of the unamortized debt premium on the initial and subsequent loan and (iii) the change in fair value of the conversion options on all loans.

1180145_11_ITEM15_P334_S0	As a participant in the Plan, Executive Officers are entitled to certain rights and protections under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ).

1180145_11_ITEM15_P338_S0	In addition to creating rights for plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the Plan.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P338_S1	The people who operate the Plan, called fiduciaries of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other plan participants and beneficiaries.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P338_S2	No one, including the Company or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P338_S3	If your claim for a benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P339_S0	Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P339_S1	For instance, if you request a copy of documents and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a federal court.

1180145_11_ITEM15_P340_S0	If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P340_S1	If it should happen that plan fiduciaries do not administer the Plan in accordance with its terms, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P340_S2	The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P340_S3	If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P340_S4	If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees; for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P340_S5	Assistance with Your Questions If you have any questions about the Severance Pay Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator.

1180145_11_ITEM15_P354_S1	Representatives who have material information about the Company that has not been released to the public may not disclose the information to others or use that information for securities trading purposes or any other purpose except to conduct Company business.

1180145_11_ITEM15_P354_S3	If any information is of the type that a reasonable investor would consider important in reaching an investment decision, the Company Representative who possesses such information must not buy or sell Company securities, nor provide the information to others, until such information becomes public.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P354_S4	Use of material, non-public information in the above manner is not only illegal, but also unethical.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P354_S5	Representatives who directly or indirectly involve themselves in illegal insider trading will be subject to immediate termination by the Company.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P354_S6	In order to assist the Company in its efforts to ensure compliance with laws against insider trading, the Company has adopted a separate policy CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND SECURITIES TRADING BY CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEMS, INC.

1180145_11_ITEM15_P355_S2	In addition, information provided to governments must be accurate and interactions with government officials must be honest and ethical.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P356_S0	All activities that might constitute lobbying or attempts to influence government officials must first be reviewed with and approved by legal counsel.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P357_S0	Before doing business with foreign, national, state or local government, a Representative must know the applicable rules.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P357_S1	The Company strictly prohibits making illegal payments to government officials of any country.

1180145_11_ITEM15_P358_S1	Additionally, a number of U.S. laws and regulations address when U.S. government personnel may or may not accept business gratuities.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P358_S2	In addition to violating Company s policies, the promise, offer, or delivery of a gift, favor or other gratuity to a government official or employee in violation of these rules could constitute a criminal offense.

1180145_11_ITEM15_P358_S8	Conflicts may arise when a Representative receives improper personal benefits as a result of the person s position with the Company or gains personal enrichment through access to confidential information.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P358_S9	A conflict situation can also arise when a Representative takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her CSI work objectively and effectively.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P358_S10	For that reason, all Representatives must exercise great care not to allow their personal interests to potentially conflict with CSI s interests.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P358_S11	Each Representative shall act with honesty and integrity, avoiding actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P358_S12	CSI Representatives are generally free to engage in outside activities of their choice.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P358_S13	It is important, however, that such activities do not adversely affect CSI s business, involve misuse of CSI position or resources, divert for personal gain any business opportunity from which CSI may profit, or constitute a potential source of discredit to the CSI name.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P358_S14	The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of prohibited conflicts of interest for Representatives of CSI:
1180145_11_ITEM15_P359_S0	Consulting with or employment in any capacity with a competitor, supplier or customer of CSI.

1180145_11_ITEM15_P366_S1	Representatives also owe CSI a duty of loyalty.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P366_S2	The duty of loyalty mandates that the best interests of the Company and its shareholders takes precedence over any interest possessed by a Representative not shared by the shareholders generally.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P366_S3	In the event that a conflict (or the appearance of a conflict) arises or is anticipated, Representatives must bring the matter to the attention of the Chairman of the Audit Committee.

1180145_11_ITEM15_P368_S5	If you have any question about whether any business courtesies, gratuities or gifts are appropriate, please contact your supervisor or other CSI management.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P368_S6	CSI s SOP for guidance when having interactions with Health Care Professionals or customers because there is a general prohibition on most gifts to Health Care Professionals and customer.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P368_S7	CSI s Representatives having relationship with Customers and Health Care Professionals have a separate SOP for guidance as these relationships are highly regulated Representatives must deal fairly and honestly with the Company s customers (including potential customers and Health Care Professionals or entities in a position to recommend or influence the purchase or use of Company products) and not take actions that are prohibited by applicable law or ethical standards.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P369_S0	The Company intends to follow its own company-established CSI s Standard Operating Procedures For Interactions With Health Care Professionals ( SOP ) which are largely based upon the standards set forth by AdvaMed in its Code of Ethics on Interactions with Health Care Professionals - Revised and Restated Code of Ethics effective July 1, 2009 which is found at http://www.advamed.org .
1180145_11_ITEM15_P369_S1	All Representatives who deal with customers and Health Care Professionals are separately required to read and understand the SOP and sign an acknowledgement related thereto.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P370_S0	The SOP is intended to provide Representatives guidance about appropriate interactions with customers and Health Care Professionals when conducting business within the United States to enable the Company to remain in compliance with the Federal Anti-kickback Statute and Stark Law.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P370_S1	Representatives conducting business on behalf of CSI, must also comply with this SOP and these policies apply to any expenditure by CSI Representatives, regardless of whether the expenditure is reimbursed by the Company.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P370_S2	In other words, any personal money given to or spent for the benefit of a CSI customer is considered money given or spent by the Company.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P371_S0	As used in this Code, and the Guidelines, the term customer means any individual or organization that purchases, recommends, uses, or prescribes products manufactured or distributed by CSI or an individual who is in a position to determine whether a CSI product is purchased, recommended, used, or prescribed.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P371_S1	This can include physicians, nurses, office administrators, purchasing agents, within hospitals, clinical practices, HMOs, GPOs, etc.

1180145_11_ITEM15_P373_S0	CSI will encourage ethical business practices and socially responsible industry conduct, and will not use any unlawful inducement in order to sell, recommend or arrange the sale, or prescription of its products.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P374_S0	At CSI, we believe that enduring customer relationships are based on integrity and trust.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P374_S1	We seek to gain advantage over competitors through superior products, research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and service, never through improper business practices.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P375_S0	CSI s relationships with customers are intended to benefit patient care and enhance the practice of medicine.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P375_S1	Interactions should be focused on informing customers and prospective customers about products, providing scientific and educational information, and supporting medical research and education and should not, at any time, entice representatives of customers to place their own personal interests above those of the organizations they represent or the patients who will use or need the Company s products.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P376_S0	CSI will not, directly or indirectly, offer or solicit any kind of payments or contributions for the purpose of obtaining, giving, keeping or rewarding business.

1180145_11_ITEM15_P376_S2	See CSI s SOP for guidance when having interactions with Health Care Professionals or customers because any and all entertainment and recreation with Health Care Professionals or customers is prohibited and there is a general prohibition on most gifts.

1180145_11_ITEM15_P384_S7	If you have questions about an ethical situation, you are encouraged to talk with your supervisor or with a Corporate Officer such as the Compliance Officer about any behavior you believe may be illegal or unethical.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P384_S8	You will be assured confidentiality, to the limit of the law.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P384_S9	If you do not feel it is appropriate to discuss the issue with these persons, CSI has established a hotline so that you can report concerns or potential violations anonymously (see below).
1180145_11_ITEM15_P384_S10	Anonymous callers should supply detailed information to address the concern.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P385_S0	It is against the Company s policy to retaliate against any Representative for good faith reporting of violation of this Code.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P385_S1	If you feel you have been retaliated against for raising your good faith reporting, you should immediately contact your supervisor, our Compliance Officer or the Compliance Hotline.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P385_S2	If you would like to notify the board of directors of a suspected violation, contact the Chairman of the Audit Committee: Brent G. Blackey Chairman of the Audit Committee 952.832.8635 brent.blackey@holidaycompanies.com Each report of a known or suspected violation will be promptly and thoroughly investigated.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P385_S3	If a violation has occurred, CSI will take appropriate actions to prevent similar violations.

1180145_11_ITEM15_P386_S1	The Company s hotline is designed to encourage you to report any concerns you might have about the way we are conducting our business or to identify any workplace behavior that you believe violates laws or our Company s Code of Ethics.

1180145_11_ITEM15_P386_S3	What s most important to know about the hotline is that it s available for you to use 24 hours a day and if you prefer, you can have anything you communicate over this system be completely confidential and anonymous .
1180145_11_ITEM15_P386_S4	This confidentiality is ensured because an independent company, In Touch, operates the program and, if a caller does not identify him/herself, there s no way for anyone at the Company to identify who might have called and left a message.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P387_S0	Using the hotline is as simple as dialing 1-877-344-2714 .
1180145_11_ITEM15_P387_S1	You will need to write down a five-digit case number that the automated system will assign to you.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P387_S2	It s important that you copy this number down and store it where you can find it because it s the only way that the Company will be able to request additional information and keep you posted on the progress of its investigation.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P388_S0	After you have been assigned your case number, you will be asked to record a message of any length.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P388_S1	When you ve finished providing what you have to say, either press # or simply hang-up.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P388_S2	and then it will be deleted from the system.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P388_S3	Only the written transcript of your call will be sent to representatives of the Company s management and Board of Directors.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P388_S4	That way, unless you elect to leave your name or other identifying information, anything you have to say remains confidential and anonymous.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P388_S5	As you will be reminded by In Touch after you leave a message, you should call back in five business days and be prepared to provide your five-digit case number.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P388_S6	When you do that, you will receive a message from the Company about the status of your case.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P388_S7	For those that might be more comfortable providing their information by email, you can do so by sending a message to CSI@GetInTouch.com .
1180145_11_ITEM15_P388_S8	Unless you clearly indicate that you wish to be identified, In Touch will remove your name and email address before forwarding the message to representatives of the Company s management and Board of Directors.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P388_S9	Responses from the Company to your emailed message will come from In Touch directly.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P389_S0	Although we always prefer that you first try to resolve any questions or concerns with your supervisor or a Human Resources representative, there may be times when you re not comfortable doing that or you re not satisfied with the outcome.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P389_S1	That s when you should consider using the hotline.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P390_S0	Management is committed to providing a safe, respectful and ethical working environment.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P390_S1	If at any time you don t feel that s the case, we encourage you to use the hotline and let us know.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P390_S2	In addition, we want to assure you that there will never be any retaliation against any individual for responsibly reporting a workplace related concern.
1180145_11_ITEM15_P391_S0	Public Disclosure of Code and Waivers The existence and content of this Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is disclosed to shareholders and made available as part of the Company s filings with the SEC and is also on the Company s website.

1180145_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	We are a medical device company focused on developing and commercializing minimally invasive treatment solutions for vascular disease.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	Interventional endovascular treatment of peripheral artery disease, or PAD, is our initial area of focus.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P4_S2	PAD is caused by the accumulation of plaque in peripheral arteries, most commonly occurring in the pelvis and legs.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P4_S3	PAD is a progressive disease, and, if left untreated, can lead to limb amputation or death.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our primary products, the Stealth 360 PAD System ( Stealth 360 ), Diamondback 360 PAD System ( Diamondback 360 ), and Diamondback Predator 360 PAD System ( Predator 360 ) are catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of plaque types in leg arteries both above and below the knee and address many of the limitations associated with existing treatment alternatives.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	We refer to the Stealth 360 , Diamondback 360 , and the Predator 360 collectively in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the PAD Systems.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	In August 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted us 510(k) clearance for the use of the Diamondback 360 as a therapy in patients with PAD.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	We commenced a limited commercial introduction of the Diamondback 360 in the United States in September 2007 and began a full commercial launch during the quarter ended March 31, 2008.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	We received 510(k) clearance of the Predator 360 in March 2009 and commenced commercial launch in April 2009.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P6_S3	We received 510(k) clearance of the Stealth 360 in March 2011 and commenced a commercial launch that same month.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P6_S4	The Stealth 360 contains additional ease of use and physician control features while incorporating the orbital mechanism of action, optimal shaft and crown configurations of the Diamondback 360 and Predator 360 .
1180145_12_ITEM1_P6_S5	As of June 30, 2012, we estimate that the PAD Systems had been utilized in more than 70,000 procedures.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P6_S6	We intend to expand into the interventional coronary market though we need to complete certain clinical trials and receive FDA approval to do so.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P6_S7	In May 2011, we received approval from the FDA to complete enrollment of 429 patients in our ORBIT II clinical trial for a coronary application for the Diamondback 360 , which followed the FDA s review of data from the first 50 cases in the ORBIT II trial.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P6_S8	In July 2012, we received approval from the FDA to include the new electric coronary device (similar to Stealth 360 technology used in PAD and customized specifically for the coronary application), which improves ease of use.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P6_S9	The FDA requires 100 enrollments with the new electric coronary device and will allow up to 50 additional patients in the trial, as needed, to achieve that enrollment level, bringing the maximum trial enrollment to 479.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P6_S10	More than 350 patients are now enrolled in the trial.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P6_S11	In addition to the PAD Systems, we have expanded our product portfolio through internal product development and establishment of business relationships with other medical device companies.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P6_S12	We offer multiple accessory products designed to complement the use of the PAD Systems, and we have an exclusive distribution agreement with Asahi-Intecc Co., Ltd. to market its peripheral guidewire line in the United States.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	Market Overview Peripheral Artery Disease PAD is a circulatory problem in which plaque deposits build up on the walls of the arteries, reducing blood flow to the limbs.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	The most common early symptoms of PAD are pain, cramping or fatigue in the leg or hip muscles while walking.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	Symptoms may progress to include numbness, tingling or weakness in the leg and, in severe cases, burning or aching pain in the leg, foot or toes while resting.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	As PAD progresses, additional signs and symptoms occur, including cooling or color changes in the skin of the legs or feet, and sores on the legs or feet that may not heal.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P8_S3	Progressing PAD may lead to critical limb ischemia, a condition in which the amount of oxygenated blood being delivered to the limb is insufficient to keep the tissue alive.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P8_S4	Critical limb ischemia often leads to large non-healing ulcers, infections, gangrene and, eventually, limb amputation or death.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	According to a report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 2006, PAD affects approximately eight to 12 million people in the United States.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	According to 2007 statistics from the American Heart Association, PAD becomes more common with age and affects approximately 12% to 20% of the population over 65 years old.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P9_S2	An aging population, coupled with increasing incidence of diabetes and obesity, is likely to increase the prevalence of PAD.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P9_S3	In many older PAD patients, particularly those with diabetes, PAD is characterized by fibrotic (moderately hard) or calcified (extremely hard) plaque deposits that have not been successfully treated with traditional non-invasive treatment techniques.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	PAD may involve arteries throughout the leg.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Arteries above the knee are generally long, straight and relatively wide, while arteries below the knee are shorter and branch into arteries that are progressively smaller in diameter.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Despite the severity of PAD, it remains relatively underdiagnosed.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	According to an article published in Podiatry Today in 2006, only approximately 2.5 million of the eight to 12 million people in the United States with PAD are diagnosed.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	continues due to patients failing to display symptoms or physicians misinterpreting symptoms as normal aging.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	Recent emphasis on PAD education from medical associations, insurance companies and other groups, coupled with publications in medical journals, is increasing physician and patient awareness of PAD risk factors, symptoms and treatment options.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	The PARTNERS study, which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2001, advocated increased PAD screening by primary care physicians.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	Physicians treat a significant portion of the 2.5 million people in the United States who are diagnosed with PAD using medical management, which includes lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise and drug treatment.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	For instance, within a reference group of more than 1,000 patients from the PARTNERS study, 54% of the patients with a prior diagnosis of PAD were receiving antiplatelet medication treatment.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	While medications, diet and exercise may improve blood flow, they do not treat the underlying obstruction and many patients have difficulty maintaining lifestyle changes.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	Additionally, many prescribed medications are contraindicated, or inadvisable, for patients with heart disease, which often exists in PAD patients.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	Coronary Artery Disease Based on data from the 2009 National Discharge Survey, approximately 1,133,000 percutaneous coronary interventions, or PCI, procedures occurred in the United States in 2009.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	Based on various studies, we believe that approximately 38% of PCI procedures involve moderate to severe levels of calcified coronary arteries and may benefit from the use of our device if approved for commercial use.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	In addition, approximately 415,000 coronary artery bypass graft surgeries were performed in the United States.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P17_S3	These patients generally have higher rates of calcification and we believe they may benefit from the use of our device if approved for commercial use.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	The PAD Systems each use a single-use, low-profile catheter that travels over our proprietary ViperWire Advance Guide Wire and is powered by either a saline infusion pump (Stealth 360 ) or an external control unit (Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 ).
1180145_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	a sheath, which covers the drive shaft and permits delivery of saline or medications to the treatment area.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	The ViperWire Advance is the second generation of the ViperWire.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	The ViperWire Advance was designed to offer an improved ability to maneuver through tortuous, twisting blood vessels and cross challenging lesions.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	The PAD Systems travel over this wire to the lesion and operate on this wire.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	ViperSlide is an exclusive lubricant designed to optimize the smooth operation of the PAD Systems.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	On April 4, 2011, we entered into a five-year supply agreement with Fresenius Kabi AB pursuant to which Fresenius manufactures and serves as a single-source supplier of the ViperSlide lubricant through March 2016.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	Used exclusively with the Stealth 360 , the saline infusion pump mounts directly to the intravenous pole and bathes the device s shaft and crown and provides a power supply for the operation of the catheter.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	Used in conjunction with the Diamondback 360 and Predator 360 PAD Systems, the control unit incorporates a touch-screen interface on an easily maneuverable pole.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	Using an external air supply, the control unit regulates air pressure to drive the turbine located in the catheter handle to speeds ranging up to 200,000 revolutions per minute.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	Saline, delivered by a pumping mechanism on the control unit, bathes the device shaft and crown.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P23_S3	The constant flow of saline reduces the risk of heat generation.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	Technology Overview Plaque Modification through Differential Sanding.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	The PAD Systems were designed to allow the devices to differentiate between soft compliant and harder diseased tissue in the artery.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	The diamond grit crown preferentially engages and sands the harder material, but is designed not to damage more compliant parts of the artery.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	Arterial lesions tend to be harder and stiffer than compliant, undiseased vessel tissue, and they often are fibrotic or calcified.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P25_S3	The PAD Systems also treat soft plaque, which is still harder than a normal vessel wall.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	The mechanism of action is a function of the centrifugal force generated by the PAD Systems as they rotate.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	As the crown moves outward, the centrifugal force is offset by the counterforce exerted by the arterial wall.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P26_S2	If the tissue is compliant, it should flex away, rather than generating an opposing force that would allow the PAD Systems to engage and sand the wall.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P26_S3	Diseased tissue provides resistance and is able to generate an opposing force that allows the PAD Systems to engage and sand the plaque.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P26_S4	The sanded plaque is broken down into particles generally smaller than circulating red blood cells that are washed away downstream with the patient s natural blood flow.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P26_S5	Testing performed in carbon blocks, animal and cadaver models showed:
1180145_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	99% of particles were smaller than the lumen of the capillaries (which provide the connection between the arterial and venous system).
1180145_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	The small particle size minimizes the risk of vascular bed overload, or a saturation of the peripheral vessels with large particles, which may cause slow or reduced blood flow to the foot.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	The small size of the particles allows them to be managed by the body s natural cleansing of the blood, whereby various types of white blood cells eliminate worn-out cells and other debris in the bloodstream.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P27_S3	The systems operate on the principles of centrifugal force.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	As the speed of the crown s rotation increases, it creates centrifugal force, which increases the crown s orbit and presses the diamond grit coated offset crown against the lesion or plaque, removing a small amount of plaque with each orbit.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	The characteristics of the orbit and the resulting lumen size can be adjusted by modifying three variables:
1180145_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	An increase in speed creates a larger orbital circle, thus accommodating vessels with larger lumens.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our current Stealth 360 system allows the user to choose between three rotational speeds.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	The crown can be designed with various weights (as determined by crown geometry and material density) and coated with diamond grit of various types.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	The crown is available in two configurations classic and solid.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P32_S2	Physicians select crown sizes and configurations based on several case criteria, including reference vessel size, length and degree of stenosis, stenosis morphology, and anatomy tortuosity.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P32_S3	Physicians often use the classic crown configuration in small, more tortuous vessels.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P32_S4	The solid crown configuration is designed with a tapered, leading edge for frontal sanding, which can be used in tight calcified disease.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	The Stealth 360 device is available with a 1.50 millimeter and 2.00 millimeter classic crown, and 1.25 millimeter, 1.50 millimeter and 2.00 millimeter solid crown configuration.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	There is also a 1.25 millimeter micro-solid crown available with the Stealth 360 device, which is designed to provide hybrid performance between the classic and solid configurations.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	For both configurations, the catheter length is 145 centimeters, which addresses procedural approach and target lesion locations both above and below the knee.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	The PAD Systems are versatile in that by adjusting one or more of the speeds in conjunction with crown selection, multiple lesions can be treated.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	The PAD Systems can be used to treat plaque in multiple anatomic locations.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	Below-the-Knee and Behind-the-Knee Peripheral Artery Disease.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	Behind-the-knee lesions also present challenges if a stent is required because stents frequently fracture due to the forces exerted on the vessels when the knee bends or flexes.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	The PAD Systems are effective in both diffused and calcified vessels.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	This was demonstrated in the OASIS trial, where 94.5% of lesions treated with the Diamondback 360 were behind or below the knee.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	Arteries above-the-knee are longer, straighter and wider than below-the-knee vessels.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	Plaque in these arteries may also be diffuse, fibrotic and calcific.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P39_S2	As a result, our products are often used to treat lesions above the knee.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P39_S3	We have developed a modified version of the Diamondback 360 to treat coronary arteries.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P39_S4	We have conducted numerous bench studies, pre-clinical animal studies, and our ORBIT I 50-patient human feasibility clinical study to evaluate the Diamondback 360 in coronary artery disease.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	A coronary application requires us to conduct a clinical trial and file a premarket application, or PMA, and obtain approval from the FDA.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	We participated in three pre-investigational device exemption, or IDE, meetings with the FDA and completed the human feasibility portion of a coronary trial in the summer of 2008 in India, enrolling 50 patients.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P40_S2	The FDA agreed to accept the data from the India trial to support an IDE submission.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P40_S3	The FDA granted unconditional approval in April 2010 to begin the ORBIT II coronary study in the United States.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P40_S4	In May 2011, we received approval from the FDA to complete enrollment of 429 patients in our ORBIT II clinical trial for a coronary application for the Diamondback 360 , which followed the FDA s review of data from the first 50 cases in the ORBIT II trial.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P40_S5	In July 2012 we received approval from the FDA to include the new electric coronary device (similar to Stealth 360 technology used in PAD and customized specifically for the coronary application), which improves ease of use.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P40_S6	The FDA requires 100 enrollments with the new electric coronary device and will allow up to 50 additional patients in the trial, as needed, to achieve that enrollment level, bringing the maximum trial enrollment to 479.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P40_S7	More than 350 patients are now enrolled in the trial.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our Solution The PAD Systems represent an innovative approach to the treatment of PAD that provides physicians and patients with a procedure that addresses many of the limitations of traditional treatment alternatives.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	The PAD Systems each use single-use catheters that incorporate a flexible drive shaft with an offset diamond grit coated crown.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	Physicians position the crown at the site of an arterial plaque-containing lesion and remove the plaque by spinning the crown to orbit and sand it away, creating a smooth lumen, or channel, in the vessel.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	The PAD Systems are designed to differentiate between hard plaque and soft, compliant arterial tissue, a concept that we refer to as differential sanding.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	Normal arteries are compliant and have the ability to expand and contract as needed to supply blood flow to the legs and feet.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P44_S1	Arteries burdened with fibrotic and/or calcified plaque due to PAD lose their compliance which makes other therapies such as angioplasty, stenting, surgical bypass and atherectomy problematic.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P44_S2	The PAD Systems sand plaque into small particles and restore both blood flow and vessel compliance.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P44_S3	The particles created by the PAD Systems are generally smaller than red blood cells and are carried away by the bloodstream.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P44_S4	The small size of the particles avoids the need for plaque collection reservoirs.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	The PAD Systems can typically treat the diseased arteries with less than two minutes of sanding time, potentially reducing the overall procedure time.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P45_S1	We believe the PAD Systems offer the following key benefits:
1180145_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	Differential Sanding Reduces Risk of Adverse Events.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	The PAD Systems are designed to differentiate between hard plaque and soft compliant arterial tissue.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	Arteries are composed of three tissue layers.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P48_S1	The diamond grit coated offset crown at the working end of the devices engages and removes plaque from the artery wall with minimal likelihood of penetrating or damaging the fragile, inner layer of the arterial wall because soft, compliant tissue flexes away from the crown.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P48_S2	Furthermore, the PAD Systems have rarely penetrated the middle or outer layers of the artery s wall.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	1.6% during our pivotal OASIS trial.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	Analysis by an independent pathology laboratory of more than 434 consecutive cross sections of porcine arteries treated with the Diamondback 360 revealed there was minimal to no damage, on average, to the middle layer, which is typically associated with restenosis.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P50_S1	In addition, the safety profile of the Diamondback 360 was found to be non-inferior to that of angioplasty, which is a common interventional method.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	The PAD Systems sand plaque away from artery walls in a manner that produces particles of such a small size generally smaller than red blood cells that they are carried away by the bloodstream.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P51_S1	The small size of the particles avoids the need for plaque collection reservoirs on the catheter and reduces the need for ancillary distal protection devices, commonly used with directional cutting atherectomy, and also significantly reduces the risk that larger pieces of removed plaque will block blood flow downstream.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	Allows Continuous Blood Flow During Procedure.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	The PAD Systems allow for continuous blood flow during the procedure, except when used in chronic total occlusions.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P52_S2	Other devices may restrict blood flow due to the size of the catheter required or the use of distal protection devices, which could result in complications such as excessive heat and tissue damage.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	Efficacy Demonstrated in a 124-Patient Clinical Trial.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	Our pivotal OASIS clinical trial was a prospective 20-center study that involved 124 patients with 201 lesions treated by the Diamondback 360 .
1180145_12_ITEM1_P54_S1	Performance targets were established cooperatively with the FDA before the trial began.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P54_S2	Despite 55% of the lesions consisting of calcified plaque the Diamondback 360 in the OASIS trial successfully met the FDA s study endpoints.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P54_S3	Because the Predator 360 and Stealth 360 mechanism of action is identical to that of the Diamondback 360 , no additional efficacy trials were required by the FDA for 510(k) clearance of either PAD System.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	Treats Difficult, Fibrotic and Calcified Lesions.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	The PAD Systems enable physicians to remove plaque from long, fibrotic, calcified or bifurcated lesions in peripheral arteries both above and below the knee.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	The orbiting action of the PAD Systems removes the hard plaque in the artery by sanding.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P57_S1	As the crown sands away the plaque, the lumen of the artery is opened and the vessel wall becomes more compliant.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P57_S2	The orbital motion and speed of the crown increases, thus allowing for continuous removal of plaque as the opening of the lumen increases during the operation of the devices.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	Non-orbiting rotational atherectomy catheters remove plaque by either abrading the lesion with a spinning, abrasive burr, or by shaving the lesion with sharp blades.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P58_S1	The burr-type device acts in a manner similar to a drill and only creates a lumen the same size or slightly smaller than the size of the burr.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P58_S2	The shaving devices are not able to discriminate between lesion disease and healthy vessel tissue.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	The differential sanding of the PAD Systems creates a smooth surface inside the lumen.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P59_S1	We believe that the smooth lumens created by the devices increase the velocity of blood flow and decrease the resistance to blood flow, which may decrease the potential for restenosis, or renarrowing of the arteries.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	Physicians using the PAD Systems employ techniques similar to those used in angioplasty, which are familiar to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists who are trained in endovascular techniques.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P60_S1	The devices simple user interfaces require minimal additional training.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	The orbital technology and differential sanding process of the PAD Systems allows for a single insertion to treat lesions, in most cases.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P61_S1	Because the particles of plaque sanded away are of such small sizes, the PAD Systems do not require a collection reservoir that needs to be repeatedly emptied or cleaned during the procedure.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P61_S2	Rather, the PAD Systems allow for multiple passes of the device over the lesion until plaque is removed and a smooth lumen is created.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	The PAD Systems have the ability to treat the entire leg, including small vessels below the knee.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	The PAD Systems have a short treatment time, typically less than two minutes.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	Single Crown Can Create Various Lumen Sizes Limiting Hospital Inventory Costs.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	The orbital mechanism of action with the PAD Systems allows one device to create various diameter lumens inside the artery.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P65_S1	Adjusting the rotational speed of the crown changes the orbit to create the desired lumen diameter, thereby potentially avoiding the need to use multiple catheters of different sizes to treat multiple lesions.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	Since the physician does not need to insert and remove multiple catheters or clean a plaque collection reservoir to complete the procedure, there is a potential for decreased procedure time.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	Our goal is to be the leading provider of minimally invasive solutions for the treatment of vascular disease.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P67_S1	The key elements of our strategy include:
1180145_12_ITEM1_P68_S0	Drive Adoption Through Our Direct Sales Organization and Key Physician Leaders.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P68_S1	We expect to continue to drive adoption of the PAD Systems through our direct sales force, which targets interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P68_S2	As a key element of our strategy, we focus on educating and training physicians on the PAD Systems through our direct sales force and during seminars where physician industry leaders discuss case studies and treatment techniques using the devices.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P69_S0	Collect Additional Clinical Evidence on Benefits of the PAD Systems.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P69_S1	Physicians are increasingly requesting clinical study evidence to allow them to make the best treatment decisions to achieve the best possible short-term and long-term outcomes for their patients.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P69_S2	We are focused on collecting and using clinical evidence to demonstrate the advantages of the PAD Systems and drive physician acceptance.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P70_S0	Expand Product Portfolio within the Market for Treatment of Peripheral Arteries.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	In addition to the PAD Systems, we have expanded our product portfolio.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P71_S1	We offer multiple accessory devices designed to complement the use of the PAD Systems.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P71_S2	We continue to market the following products:
1180145_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	ViperWire Advance guidewire offering improved ability to maneuver through tortuous, twisting blood vessels and cross challenging lesions We are continuing to evaluate internal product development to further expand our portfolio of PAD treatment solutions.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	Evaluate Technology Platform for Coronary Market Use.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P73_S1	We are evaluating our orbital technology to expand into the interventional coronary market.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P73_S2	A coronary application would address a large market opportunity, further leveraging our core technology and expanding its market potential.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	In 2008, we completed the ORBIT I trial, a 50-patient study in India that investigated the safety of the Diamondback 360 device in treating calcified coronary artery lesions.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P74_S1	Results successfully met both safety and efficacy endpoints.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P75_S0	An IDE application has been approved by the FDA for ORBIT II, a pivotal trial that will enroll up to 479 patients in the United States to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the PAD Systems in treating severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P76_S0	In August 2009, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Asahi to market two peripheral guidewire lines in the United States.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P76_S1	In August 2011, we signed an amendment to expand the agreement to include three additional peripheral guidewires.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P76_S2	The product portfolio now includes the Treasure Floppy and Regalia; and three specialty wires: Astato 20, Astao 30, Treasure 12.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P77_S0	In addition to adding to our product portfolio through internal development efforts, we intend to continue to explore the acquisition of other product lines, technologies or companies that may leverage our sales force or complement our strategic objectives.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P77_S1	We plan to continue to evaluate distribution agreements, licensing transactions, other strategic partnerships, and the financial viability of marketing the PAD Systems internationally.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P77_S2	Clinical Trials and Studies for Our Products We are committed to providing relevant clinical evidence to allow physicians to select and utilize the best treatment options for their patients.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P77_S3	We have conducted 13 clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the PAD Systems in treating peripheral vascular disease, enrolling a total of 3,767 patients in our PAD I and PAD II pilot trials, OASIS pivotal trial, OASIS LT, CONFIRM DIAMONDBACK, CONFIRM PREDATOR CONFIRM OUTFLOW Post-Market Registries and the CALCIUM 360 and COMPLIANCE 360 post-market, randomized feasibility studies.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P77_S4	The results of these studies consistently demonstrate that the PAD Systems provide predictable, repeatable and durable results that further differentiate themselves from other PAD treatments.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P78_S0	Coronary artery disease, or CAD, continues to be a widespread and growing problem worldwide.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P78_S1	Performing PCI on calcified lesions can lead to major adverse cardiac event, or MACE, rates as high as 24% at 30 days, stent malapposition and a number of procedural complications.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P79_S0	To demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of orbital atherectomy for use in calcified coronary arteries, the ORBIT I coronary clinical trial was completed in India in 2009.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P79_S1	In 2010, we began the ORBIT II pivotal study in the United States, evaluating the use of the Diamondback 360 in coronary arteries.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P79_S2	The ORBIT II trial is the first trial in the United States designed specifically for difficult to treat calcified coronary artery disease.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P80_S0	The common metrics used to evaluate plaque modification and removal devices for PAD include:
1180145_12_ITEM1_P81_S0	Compliance change as defined in the COMPLIANCE 360 protocol is to achieve 30% residual stenosis with orbital atherectomy followed by a low-pressure balloon inflation of 4 atmospheres pressure (atm).
1180145_12_ITEM1_P82_S0	Absolute plaque reduction is the difference between the pre-treatment percent stenosis, or the narrowing of the vessel and the post-treatment percent stenosis as measured angiographically.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P83_S0	Target lesion revascularization rate, or TLR rate, is the percentage of patients who have undergone another peripheral intervention in the same lesion as treated during index procedure due to their worsening symptoms.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P84_S0	Treatments such as an angioplasty, stenting, surgery or atherectomy may be used to reopen the treated lesion site.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P85_S0	The Ankle Brachial Index, or ABI, is a measurement that is useful to evaluate the adequacy of circulation in the legs and improvement or worsening of leg circulation over time.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P85_S1	The ABI is a ratio between the blood pressure in a patient s ankle and a patient s arm, with a ratio above 0.9 being normal.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P85_S2	The common metrics used to evaluate atherectomy devices for PAD include:
1180145_12_ITEM1_P86_S0	SAEs include any experience that is fatal or life-threatening, is permanently disabling, requires or prolongs hospitalization, or requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P86_S1	SAEs may or may not be related to the device.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P87_S0	Perforations occur when the artery is punctured during atherectomy treatment.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P87_S1	Perforations may be non-serious or serious (referred to as an SAE) depending on the treatment required to repair the perforation.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P88_S0	The first clinical trial was a two-site, 17-patient feasibility clinical trial in Europe, referred to as PAD I, which began in March 2005.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P88_S1	Patients enrolled in the trial had lesions that were less than 10 cm in length in arteries between 1.5 mm and 6.0 mm in diameter, with Rutherford Class scores of IV or lower.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P89_S0	evaluated at the time of the procedure and at 30 days following treatment.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P89_S1	The purpose of PAD I was to obtain the first human clinical experience and evaluate the safety of the Diamondback 360 .
1180145_12_ITEM1_P89_S2	This was determined by estimating the cumulative incidence of patients experiencing one or more SAEs within 30 days post-treatment.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P89_S3	The results of PAD I confirmed that the Diamondback 360 was safe and established that the Diamondback 360 could be used to treat vessels in the range of 1.5 mm to 4.0 mm, which are found primarily below the knee.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P89_S4	PAD I also showed that removal of plaque could be accomplished and the resulting device-to-lumen ratio was approximately 1.0 to 2.0.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P89_S5	The SAE rate in PAD I was 6% (one of 17 patients).
1180145_12_ITEM1_P90_S0	After being granted the CE Mark in May 2005, a 66-patient European clinical trial, PAD II, was initiated at seven sites, in August 2005.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P90_S1	All patients had stenosis in vessels below the femoral artery of between 1.5 mm and 4.0 mm in diameter, with at least 50% blockage.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P91_S0	The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the acute (30 days or less) risk of experiencing an SAE post procedure and provide evidence of device effectiveness.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P91_S1	Effectiveness was confirmed angiographically and based on the percentage of absolute plaque reduction.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P91_S2	The PAD II results demonstrated safe and effective debulking in vessels with diameters ranging from 1.5 mm to 4.0 mm with a mean absolute plaque reduction of 55%.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P91_S3	The SAE rate in PAD II was 9% (six of 66 patients), which did not differ significantly from existing non-invasive treatment options.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P92_S0	An IDE was approved in September 2005 to begin our pivotal United States trial, OASIS.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P93_S0	OASIS was a 124-patient, 20-center, prospective trial that began enrollment in January 2006.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P93_S1	Patients included in the trial had an ABI of less than 0.9, a Rutherford Class score of class V or lower and treated arteries of between 1.5 mm and 4.0 mm or less in diameter via angiogram measurement, with a well-defined lesion of at least 50% diameter stenosis and lesions of no greater than 10.0 cm in length.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P93_S2	The primary efficacy study endpoint was absolute plaque reduction of the target lesions from baseline to immediately post-procedure.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P93_S3	The primary safety endpoint was the cumulative incidence of SAEs at 30 days.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P93_S4	In the OASIS trial, 94.5% of lesions treated were behind or below the knee, an area where lesions have traditionally gone untreated until they require bypass surgery or amputation.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P93_S5	Of the lesions treated in OASIS, 55% were comprised of calcified plaque, which presents a challenge to proper expansion and apposition of balloons and stents, and 48% were diffuse, or greater than 3 cm in length, which typically requires multiple balloon expansions or stent placements.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P93_S6	Competing plaque removal devices are often ineffective with these difficult to treat lesions.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P93_S7	The average time of treatment in the OASIS trial was three minutes per lesion, which compares favorably to the treatment time required by other plaque removal devices.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P93_S8	The following table is a summary of the OASIS trial results:
1180145_12_ITEM1_P94_S0	* Mean Standard Deviation In August 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted us 510(k) clearance for the use of the Diamondback 360 as a therapy in patients with PAD.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P95_S0	CLEAR 360 Study We conducted the CLEAR 360 study to evaluate the incidence of clinically significant hemolysis associated with orbital atherectomy used to treat severe peripheral arterial disease.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P95_S1	This study enrolled 31 patients at four U.S. medical centers and was completed in 2009.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P95_S2	This trial concluded that there was no clinically significant hemolysis after orbital atherectomy.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P96_S0	In May 2010, enrollment was completed in the COMPLIANCE 360 clinical trial.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P96_S1	This post-market prospective, randomized, multi-center study evaluated the clinical and economic benefits of modifying plaque to change large vessel compliance above the knee with the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 .
1180145_12_ITEM1_P96_S2	The study compared the performance of the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 , plus low-pressure balloon angioplasty, if desired, with that of high-pressure balloon inflation alone.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P97_S0	Fifty patients were enrolled at nine U.S. medical centers with six and 12 month follow-up periods.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P97_S1	The study proved that compared to balloon angioplasty alone, the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 plus low pressure balloon angioplasty leads to better luminal gain by improving lesion compliance and decreases the need for adjunctive stenting for the treatment of calcified femoral popliteal disease.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P97_S2	Restenosis and TLR were similar at 12 months despite the large disparity of stent usage between the two groups.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P97_S3	The results of this trial demonstrated that the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 can achieve results in calcified plaque by improving lesion compliance through differential sanding, without the need for stent placement.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P98_S0	In April 2010, enrollment was completed in the CALCIUM 360 o study, a prospective, randomized, multi-center study comparing the effectiveness of the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 to balloon angioplasty in treating calcified lesions below the knee.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P99_S0	Calcified plaque exists in about 75 percent of lesions below the knee.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P100_S0	Fifty patients were enrolled at eight U.S. medical centers.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P100_S1	Procedural success was 93.1% (27 out of 29 lesions) for Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 plus balloon angioplasty and 82.4% (28 out of 34 lesions) for balloon angioplasty alone.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P100_S2	Bail out stenting was seen in two out of 29 (6.9%) of Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 and five out of 35 (14.3%) of balloon angioplasty treated lesions.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P100_S3	At one year follow-up there were no amputations in either group.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P100_S4	Freedom from target vessel revascularization and death was seen in 93.3% and 100% in the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 and 80.0% and 68.4% of the balloon angioplasty group, respectively.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P100_S5	Six and 12 month results showed the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 treatment outperformed balloon angioplasty.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P100_S6	A key finding was that by modifying calcified lesions first, the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 allowed use of a lower-pressure adjunctive balloon therapy, reducing the need for bail out stenting with improved longer-term patient outcomes.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P101_S0	CONFIRM Post-Market Clinical Registry Series We completed enrollment in the CONFIRM Post-Market Clinical Registry Series, that was designed to further evaluate acute parameters related to the use of the PAD Systems.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P101_S1	The CONFIRM Series consisted of three registries: CONFIRM I DIAMONDBACK, CONFIRM II PREDATOR, and CONFIRM III OUTFLOW.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P101_S2	Post-Market Registry was completed in March 2010.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P101_S3	In this prospective registry, 1,146 lesions were treated by 84 investigators at 57 medical centers with the Diamondback 360 .
1180145_12_ITEM1_P101_S4	Patient characteristics were as follows: 81.6% were smokers, 60.0% were diabetic, and 89.7% had hypertension.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P101_S5	Lesions treated were above the knee (46.5%), behind the knee (17.5%) and below the knee (36.0%).
1180145_12_ITEM1_P101_S6	Long and calcified lesions were treated with the Diamondback 360 followed by low pressure balloon angioplasty, if desired.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P101_S7	An average residual stenosis of 12.0% was achieved following treatment, which is consistent with that achieved in PAD I, PAD II, and OASIS.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P101_S8	Bail out stenting, or stenting required due to tears in the vessel wall, occurred in 4.6% of lesions.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P101_S9	This is lower than the 35% to 40% bail-out stent rate reported in the literature for patients treated with high pressure balloon angioplasty alone in this type of challenging patient population.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P101_S10	Results of this study were presented at the Complex Cardiovascular Catheter Therapeutic, or C3, conference in Orlando, FL in June 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P101_S11	Enrollment of 1,127 patients by 153 investigators at 122 institutions in the prospective CONFIRM II PREDATOR Post-Market Registry was completed December 2010.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P101_S12	Data on acute clinical performance and short-term economic parameters were collected during this study.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P101_S13	In this prospective registry, average patient age was 70.7 years; 61.5% were male and 90% had lesion with mild to severe calcium.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P101_S14	The average lesion length was 72 mm.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P102_S0	Predator 360 was used followed by balloon angioplasty (mean 5.44 atms) in 86% of lesions.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P102_S1	Procedural events included minor and major dissection (12.3%), perforation (0.4%), slow flow (3.8%), abrupt closure (1.4%), distal macro embolization (1.9%) and bail-out stenting due to dissection (6.3%).
1180145_12_ITEM1_P102_S2	Average stenosis was 87.8% pre-procedure, 33.9% post-orbital and 9.6% post-adjunctive treatment.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P103_S0	study validates the use of the latest iteration of orbital technology in restoring flow by changing lesion compliance, thus allowing low-pressure balloon angioplasty with limited complications and reduced need for bail out stenting.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P103_S1	These results were presented at the San Francisco TCT conference in November 2011.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P104_S0	Data from CONFIRM DIAMONDBACK and PREDATOR registries were used to design the CONFIRM III OUTFLOW registry.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P104_S1	This was the third study in the CONFIRM series to further evaluate acute procedural outcomes and economic parameters associated with use of the Diamondback Orbital Atherectomy System.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P104_S2	Enrollment of 1,275 patients in the CONFIRM III OUTFLOW Post-Market Registry was completed June 2011.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P104_S3	In this prospective registry 59% were male and the average patient age was 72 years.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P104_S4	Lesions treated above the knee were 42%, behind the knee were 16%, below the knee were 41%, and unknown were 2%.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P104_S5	Lesions were treated with the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 followed by low pressure balloon angioplasty, if desired.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P104_S6	Pre-procedure stenosis was 87% and the average residual stenosis of 10% was achieved following orbital and adjunctive treatment.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P104_S7	Dissections rate was 9.9%, bail-out stenting occurred in 6.0% of lesions and a low perforation rate was 0.7%.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P104_S8	The CONFIRM III OUTFLOW registry provides additional evidence of the consistent results obtained using Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 to treat difficult peripheral arterial disease.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P105_S0	The ORBIT I feasibility study evaluated performance of the Diamondback 360 for the treatment of de novo calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P105_S1	The ORBIT I trial was completed in India in 2009 and enrolled 50 patients.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P105_S2	The endpoints were measured by device performance and MACE rate and TLR at six months.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P105_S3	The observed MACE rate at 30-day and at 6 months was 6% and 8% respectively.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P105_S4	The 30 day and 6 month TLR was 2%.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P106_S0	The ORBIT I trial demonstrates that the Diamondback system can be used to modify de novo calcified coronary lesions and facilitated stent delivery in this difficult-to-treat plaque morphology.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P106_S1	ORBIT II Coronary IDE Study To market the Diamondback 360 in the United States for use in the coronary arteries, we are required to conduct further clinical trials and obtain premarket approval from the FDA.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P106_S2	In May 2010, the FDA approved the IDE and we began the ORBIT II pivotal clinical trial.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P106_S3	This trial plans to enroll up to 479 patients in up to 55 U.S. investigational centers to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the PAD Systems in treating severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P106_S4	In May 2011, we received approval from the FDA to complete enrollment of 429 patients in our ORBIT II clinical trial for a coronary application for the Diamondback 360 , which followed the FDA s review of data from the first 50 cases in the ORBIT II trial.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P106_S5	In July 2012 we received approval from the FDA to include the new electric coronary device (similar to Stealth 360 technology used in PAD and customized specifically for the coronary application), which improves ease of use.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P106_S6	The FDA requires 100 enrollments with the new electric coronary device and will allow up to 50 additional patients in the trial, as needed, to achieve that enrollment level, bringing the maximum trial enrollment to 479.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P106_S7	More than 350 patients are now enrolled in the trial.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P107_S0	Sales and Marketing We market and sell our products through a direct sales force in the United States.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P108_S0	Revenues for the PAD Systems for fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were $73.0 million, $69.3 million and $57.4 million, respectively.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P109_S0	While we sell directly to hospitals and office-based laboratories, we have targeted sales and marketing efforts to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists with experience using similar catheter-based procedures, such as angioplasty, stenting, and cutting or laser atherectomy.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P109_S1	Physician referral programs and peer-to-peer education are other key elements of our sales strategy.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P110_S0	Patient referrals come from general practitioners, podiatrists, nephrologists and endocrinologists.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P110_S1	We target our marketing efforts to practitioners through physician education, medical conferences, seminars, peer-reviewed journals and marketing materials.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P110_S2	Our sales and marketing program focuses on:
1180145_12_ITEM1_P111_S0	We are not marketing our products internationally; however, we continue to evaluate international opportunities.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P111_S1	We executed a Purchasing Agreement with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, L.P., or HPG, that became effective on July 15, 2011.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P111_S2	HPG acts as a group purchasing organization for the healthcare providers belonging to HPG as participants.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P111_S3	Under the Purchasing Agreement, all of HPG s participants located in the United States or its territories are eligible to purchase the PAD Systems and related products at prices set forth in the Purchasing Agreement.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P111_S4	HPG has agreed not to contract with more than one alternative supplier from which participants may purchase products comparable to ours under the agreement.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P111_S5	During the term of the agreement, we have agreed to not solicit any HPG participant to enter into a separate agreement for our products.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P112_S0	Research and Development Our research and development efforts are focused in the development of products to penetrate our three key target markets: below and behind-the-knee, above-the-knee and coronary vessels.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P112_S1	Research and development projects include the development of electric versions of the PAD Systems, shaft designs, crown designs, and PAD and coronary clinical trials.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P112_S2	Research and development expenses for fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were $11.4 million, $8.9 million and $10.3 million, respectively.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P113_S0	Manufacturing We use internally-manufactured and externally-sourced components to manufacture the PAD Systems.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P113_S1	Most of the externally-sourced components are available from multiple suppliers; however, a few key components, including the diamond grit coated crown, micro motors, printed circuit board assemblies, and our ViperSlide Lubricant are single sourced.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P113_S2	We have strategies and arrangements in place for procuring our key components from alternative suppliers in the event that one or more of our single source suppliers were to discontinue supplying us with a key component.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P113_S3	We assemble the shaft, crown and handle components on-site, and test, pack, seal and label the finished assembly before sending the packaged product to a contract sterilization facility.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P113_S4	Upon return from the sterilizer, the product is held in inventory prior to shipping to our customers.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P113_S5	Our manufacturing facility in Minnesota, including the shaft manufacturing and the controlled-environment assembly areas, are equipped to accommodate approximately 30,000 devices per shift annually.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P113_S6	It also has storage capacity for approximately 8,000 devices and 50 control units.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P113_S7	As the control unit becomes obsolete, we will convert our storage space for use with the Stealth 360 PAD System.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P113_S8	Our Pearland, Texas facility is 46,000 square feet and includes a custom-built clean room and production space for future expansion of value-add processes, including machining and electronics assembly.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P113_S9	The facility, when it becomes fully staffed and equipped, will have the capacity to produce approximately 75,000 devices per shift annually.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P113_S10	This facility has finished goods storage capacity for greater than 15,000 devices of the PAD Systems and other accessory products and over 500 Stealth 360 saline infusion pumps.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P113_S11	We are registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P113_S12	We have opted to maintain quality assurance and quality management certifications to enable us to market our products in the member states of the European Union, the European Free Trade Association and countries that have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements with the European Union.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P113_S13	We are ISO 13485:2003 certified, and our renewal is due by December 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P113_S14	Since commercialization, we have had three minor instances of recall, involving a single lot of Diamondback 360 devices (8 units), two boxes of ViperWires (10 wires), and 70 lots of Stealth 360 devices (145 units), related to Use By date labeling issues.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P113_S15	While these recalls were reported to the FDA, according to regulations, they did not present a risk to patient safety.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P113_S16	A separate recall, initiated in 2009 and completed in 2010, involved the ViperSheath, which is owned and manufactured by Thomas Medical Products.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P114_S0	All of the unused ViperSheaths were captured and subsequently destroyed by Thomas Medical Products, with FDA observance.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P114_S1	We also completed a recall in June 2012 involving six lots of Stealth 360 micro crown devices (45 units) due to the potential for an insufficient solder bond.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P114_S2	All unused devices were returned and no patient injuries resulted from this recall.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P115_S0	Third-Party Reimbursement and Pricing Third-party payors, including private insurers, and government insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, pay for a significant portion of patient care provided in the United States.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P115_S1	The single largest payor in the United States is the Medicare program, a federal governmental health insurance program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P115_S2	Medicare covers certain medical care expenses for eligible elderly and disabled individuals, including a large percentage of the population with PAD who could be treated with the PAD Systems.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P115_S3	In addition, private insurers often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P115_S4	Consequently, Medicare s coverage and reimbursement policies are important to our operations.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P116_S0	CMS has established Medicare reimbursement codes describing atherectomy products and procedures using atherectomy products.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P116_S1	We believe that physicians and hospitals that treat PAD with the PAD Systems will generally be eligible to receive reimbursement from Medicare and private insurers for the cost of the single-use catheter and the physician s services.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P117_S0	The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P117_S1	The PAD Systems compete with a variety of other products or devices for the treatment of vascular disease, including stents, balloon angioplasty catheters and atherectomy catheters, as well as products used in vascular surgery.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P117_S2	Large competitors in the stent and balloon angioplasty market segments include Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific, Cook Medical, Johnson Johnson and Medtronic.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P117_S3	We also compete against manufacturers of atherectomy catheters including, among others, Covidien, Spectranetics, Boston Scientific and MEDRAD, a business of Bayer HealthCare, as well as other manufacturers that may enter the market due to the increasing demand for treatment of vascular disease.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P117_S4	Other competitors include pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs for the treatment of mild to moderate PAD and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral bypass procedures.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P117_S5	We are not aware of any competing catheter systems either currently on the market or in development that also use an orbital motion to create lumens larger than the catheter itself.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P118_S0	Because of the size of the peripheral opportunities, competitors and potential competitors have historically dedicated significant resources to aggressively promote their products.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P118_S1	We believe that the PAD Systems compete primarily on the basis of:
1180145_12_ITEM1_P119_S0	Patents and Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and other intellectual property laws, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P120_S0	and 123 foreign patent applications, each of which corresponds to aspects of our U.S. patents and applications.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P120_S1	Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2012 and 2032, and our most important patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,494,890, is due to expire in 2017.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P120_S2	Our issued patents and patent applications relate primarily to the design and operation of certain interventional atherectomy devices, including the PAD Systems.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P120_S3	These patents and applications include claims covering key aspects of certain rotational atherectomy devices, including the design, manufacture and therapeutic use of certain atherectomy abrasive heads, drive shafts, control systems, handles and couplings.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P120_S4	As we continue to research and develop our atherectomy technology, we intend to file additional U.S. and foreign patent applications related to the design, manufacture and therapeutic uses of atherectomy devices.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P120_S5	In addition, we hold 12 registered U.S. trademarks, six registered marks in Europe, five registered marks in Canada, one registered mark in Mexico, and five U.S. trademark applications pending.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P120_S6	We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P120_S7	We seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P120_S8	Agreements with our employees also forbid them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P120_S9	We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P121_S0	Government Regulation of Medical Devices Governmental authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local levels and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of medical devices such as the PAD Systems.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P121_S1	Failure to obtain approval to market our products under development and to meet the ongoing requirements of these regulatory authorities could prevent us from marketing and continuing to market our products.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P122_S0	United States The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the FDA s implementing regulations govern medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P122_S1	Medical devices and their manufacturers are also subject to inspection by the FDA.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P122_S2	The FDCA, supplemented by other federal and state laws, also provides civil and criminal penalties for violations of its provisions.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P123_S0	We manufacture and market medical devices that are regulated by the FDA, comparable state agencies and regulatory bodies in other countries.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P123_S1	Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the United States will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P124_S0	The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization are premarket notification (also called 510(k) clearance) and premarket approval (also called PMA approval).
1180145_12_ITEM1_P125_S0	The type of marketing authorization applicable to a device 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is generally linked to classification of the device.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P126_S0	The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk FDA determines to be associated with a device and the extent of control deemed necessary to ensure the device s safety and effectiveness.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P126_S1	Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P126_S2	Class I devices are deemed to pose the least risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling, premarket notification, and adherence to the FDA s current good manufacturing practice requirements, as reflected in its Quality System Regulation, or QSR.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P126_S3	Class II devices are intermediate risk devices that are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or postmarket surveillance.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P126_S4	Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, and include life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, and devices not substantially equivalent to a device that is already legally marketed.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P127_S0	Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from FDA.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P127_S1	Class I and Class II devices that have not been so exempted are eligible for marketing through the 510(k) clearance pathway.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P127_S2	By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require PMA approval prior to commercial marketing.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P127_S3	The PMA approval process is generally more stringent, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) clearance process.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P127_S4	To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device legally marketed in the United States.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P127_S5	A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P127_S6	A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P128_S0	Generally, the 510(k) clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a year or more.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P129_S0	After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval (if the device as modified is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device).
1180145_12_ITEM1_P129_S1	The determination as to whether new authorization is needed is initially left to the manufacturer; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P129_S2	The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P129_S3	We received 510(k) clearance for use of the Diamondback 360 as a therapy in patients with PAD in the United States on August 22, 2007.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P129_S4	We received additional 510(k) clearances for the control unit used with the Diamondback 360 on October 25, 2007 and for the solid crown version of the Diamondback 360 on November 9, 2007.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P129_S5	We were granted 510(k) clearance of the Predator 360 in March 2009 and Stealth 360 in March 2011.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P130_S0	A PMA application requires the payment of significant user fees and must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P130_S1	A PMA application must also include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P131_S0	After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P131_S1	During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P131_S2	Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P131_S3	In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the FDA s Quality System Regulations, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P131_S4	FDA review of a PMA application is required by statute to take no longer than 180 days, although the process typically takes significantly longer, and may require several years to complete.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P131_S5	The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
1180145_12_ITEM1_P132_S0	changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P133_S0	If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P134_S0	satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P134_S1	If the FDA s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P134_S2	The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P134_S3	Even if a PMA application is approved, the FDA may approve the device with an indication that is narrower or more limited than originally sought.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P134_S4	The agency can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of the device as a condition of approval, or impose post approval requirements such as continuing evaluation and periodic reporting on the safety, efficacy and reliability of the device for its intended use.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P135_S0	New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P135_S1	PMA approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P135_S2	We are currently enrolling patients in an FDA approved IDE trial to support a PMA to use the Diamondback 360 as a therapy in treating patients with calcified coronary artery disease.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P135_S3	The FDA granted unconditional approval in April 2010 to begin the ORBIT II coronary trial in the United States.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P135_S4	This pivotal trial is set up in two phases; Phase I allowed us to enroll up to 100 patients at as many as 50 U.S. sites, Phase II allows us to expand the trial to the full complement of 429 patients.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P135_S5	In May 2011, we received approval from the FDA to complete enrollment of 429 patients in our ORBIT II clinical trial for a coronary application for the Diamondback 360 , which followed the FDA s review of data from the first 50 cases in the ORBIT II trial.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P135_S6	In July 2012 we received approval from the FDA to include the new electric coronary device (similar to Stealth 360 technology used in PAD and customized specifically for the coronary application), which improves ease of use.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P135_S7	The FDA requires 100 enrollments with the new electric coronary device and will allow up to 50 additional patients in the trial, as needed, to achieve that enrollment level, bringing the maximum trial enrollment to 479.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P135_S8	More than 350 patients are now enrolled in the trial Clinical Trials.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P135_S9	Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P135_S10	These trials generally require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P135_S11	The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P135_S12	The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non- significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P135_S13	Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P135_S14	FDA approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P135_S15	With certain exceptions, changes made to an investigational plan after an IDE is approved must be submitted in an IDE supplement and approved by FDA (and by governing institutional review boards when appropriate) prior to implementation.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P136_S0	All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with regulations and requirements collectively known as good clinical practice.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P136_S1	Good clinical practices include the FDA s IDE regulations, which describe the conduct of clinical trials with medical devices, including the recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of sponsors and investigators, and labeling of investigation devices.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P136_S2	They also prohibit promotion, test marketing or commercialization of an investigational device and any representation that such a device is safe or effective for the purposes being investigated.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P136_S3	Good clinical practices also include the FDA s regulations for institutional review board approval and for protection of human subjects (such as informed consent), as well as disclosure of financial interests by clinical investigators.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P136_S4	Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P137_S0	sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P137_S1	The commencement or completion of any clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application or clearance of a premarket notification for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:
1180145_12_ITEM1_P138_S0	the FDA concludes that the trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P139_S0	After a device is approved and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P140_S0	product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device that may present a risk to health.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P140_S1	In addition, the FDA may require a company to conduct postmarket surveillance studies or order it to establish and maintain a system for tracking its products through the chain of distribution to the patient level.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P140_S2	Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions:
1180145_12_ITEM1_P141_S0	We and our contract manufacturers, specification developers and suppliers are also required to manufacture our products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, requirements set forth in the QSR.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P141_S1	The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing and record keeping.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P141_S2	The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P141_S3	If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers is not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to clear or approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P141_S4	Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P141_S5	Fraud and Abuse Our operations will be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the FDCA, federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P141_S6	These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P141_S7	In addition, these laws require us to screen individuals and other companies, suppliers and vendors in order to ensure that they are not debarred by the federal government and therefore prohibited from doing business in the healthcare industry.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P142_S0	The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P142_S1	Several courts have interpreted the statute s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P143_S0	The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P143_S1	Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P144_S0	The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P144_S1	Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P145_S0	In addition to the laws described above, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P146_S0	The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P146_S1	The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P147_S0	Voluntary industry codes, federal guidance documents and a variety of state laws address the tracking and reporting of marketing practices relative to gifts given and other expenditures made to doctors and other healthcare professionals.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P147_S1	In addition to impacting our marketing and educational programs, internal business processes will be affected by the numerous legal requirements and regulatory guidance at the state, federal and industry levels.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P148_S0	International Regulation International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P148_S1	The time required to obtain approval in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P148_S2	For example, the primary regulatory environment in Europe with respect to medical devices is that of the European Union, which includes most of the major countries in Europe.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P148_S3	Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P149_S0	The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P149_S1	Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the European Union, although actual implementation of these directives may vary on a country-by-country basis.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P150_S0	The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of submission of a design dossier, self-assessment by the manufacturer, a third-party assessment and, review of the design dossier by a Notified Body.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P150_S1	This third-party assessment generally consists of an audit of the manufacturer s quality system and manufacturing site, as well as review of the technical documentation used to support application of the CE Mark to one s product and possibly specific testing of the manufacturer s product.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P151_S0	An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the European Union is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P151_S1	We obtained CE marking approval for sale of the Diamondback 360 in May 2005.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P152_S0	Our operations are subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P152_S1	We are currently classified and licensed as a Very Small Quantity Hazardous Waste Generator within Ramsey County, Minnesota.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P152_S2	There are no regulated wastes requiring licensing in our Texas facility.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P153_S0	As of June 30, 2012, we had 290 employees, including 69 employees in manufacturing, 162 employees in sales, 10 employees in marketing, 13 employees in clinical, 21 employees in general and administrative, and 15 employees in research and development, all of which are full-time employees.
1180145_12_ITEM1_P153_S1	None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	net losses and a short commercialization experience, and we are likely to continue to incur losses.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We are not profitable and have incurred net losses in each fiscal year since our formation in 1989.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	In particular, we had net losses of $16.8 million in fiscal 2012, $11.1 million in fiscal 2011, and $23.9 million in fiscal 2010.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P0_S3	As of June 30, 2012, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $179.2 million.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We commenced commercial sales of the Diamondback 360 in September 2007, and our short commercialization experience makes it difficult for us to predict future performance.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We also expect to incur significant additional expenses for sales and marketing and manufacturing as we continue to commercialize the PAD Systems and additional expenses as we seek to develop and commercialize future versions of the PAD Systems, a coronary application for our technology, and other products.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Additionally, we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as our business grows.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P1_S3	As a result, our operating losses are likely to continue.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We may be unable to sustain our revenue growth.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our revenue has grown in each of the fiscal years since we commenced commercial sales of the Diamondback 360 in September 2007.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Our ability to continue to increase our revenues in future periods will depend on our ability to increase sales of the PAD Systems and new and improved products we introduce, including growing our customer base and reorders of the PAD Systems from those customers, and obtaining new applications for our technology.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We may not be able to generate, sustain or increase revenues on a quarterly or annual basis.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	If we cannot achieve or sustain revenue growth for an extended period, our financial results will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Economic conditions may adversely affect our business.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Adverse worldwide economic conditions may have adverse implications on our business.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P2_S7	A significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of our customers could cause unfavorable trends in our receivable collections and additional allowances may be required, which could adversely affect our operating results.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Adverse worldwide economic conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers ability to provide us with materials and components, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P2_S9	The PAD Systems and future products may never achieve broad market acceptance.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P2_S10	The PAD Systems and future products we may develop may never gain broad market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P2_S11	The degree of market acceptance of any of our products will depend on a number of factors, including:
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	the level of education and awareness among physicians and hospitals concerning our products.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Failure of the PAD Systems to significantly penetrate current or new markets would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our customers may not be able to achieve adequate reimbursement for using the PAD Systems, which could affect the acceptance of our products and cause our business to suffer.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved medical devices and procedures is uncertain.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The commercial success of our products is substantially dependent on whether third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement for the use of such products and related services are available.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We expect the PAD Systems to generally be purchased by hospitals and other providers who will then seek reimbursement from various public and private third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers, for the services provided to patients.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We can give no assurance that these third-party payors will provide adequate reimbursement for use of the PAD Systems to permit hospitals and doctors to consider the products cost-effective for patients requiring PAD treatment, or that current reimbursement levels for the PAD Systems will continue.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P4_S4	In addition, the overall amount of reimbursement available for PAD treatment could decrease in the future.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain sufficient reimbursement could cause our business to suffer.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement, and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for use of the PAD Systems.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In order to position the PAD Systems for acceptance by third-party payors, we may have to agree to lower prices than we might otherwise charge.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Governmental and private sector payors have instituted initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs using, for example, price regulation or controls and competitive pricing programs.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Some third-party payors also require demonstrated superiority, on the basis of randomized clinical trials, or pre-approval of coverage, for new or innovative devices or procedures before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such devices or procedures.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	It is uncertain whether the PAD Systems or any future products we may develop will be viewed as sufficiently cost-effective to warrant adequate coverage and reimbursement levels.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If third-party coverage and reimbursement for the PAD Systems is limited or not available, the acceptance of the PAD Systems and, consequently, our business will be substantially harmed.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Healthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	There have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control healthcare costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system, some of which have been enacted into law, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Patient Act.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Certain of these proposals and laws could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Patient Act also imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The adoption of some or all of these proposals, including the recent federal legislation, could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We have limited data and experience regarding the safety and efficacy of the PAD Systems.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Any long-term data that is generated may not be positive or consistent with our limited short-term data, which would affect market acceptance of these products.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Because our technology is relatively new in the treatment of PAD, we have performed clinical trials only with limited patient populations.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The long-term effects of using the PAD Systems in a large number of patients are not known and the results of short-term clinical use of the PAD Systems do not necessarily predict long-term clinical benefit or reveal long-term adverse effects.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Clinical trials conducted with the PAD Systems have involved procedures performed by physicians who are very technically proficient.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Consequently, both short and long-term results reported in these studies may be significantly more favorable than typical results achieved by physicians, which could negatively impact market acceptance of the PAD Systems.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We face significant competition, must innovate to stay competitive, and may be unable to sell the PAD Systems at profitable levels.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The market for medical devices is highly competitive, dynamic and marked by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our ability to compete depends on our ability to innovate successfully, and while certain barriers exist to entry into our market we cannot assure that new entrants or existing competitors will not be able to develop products that compete directly with our products.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We compete against very large and well-known stent and balloon angioplasty device manufacturers, atherectomy catheter manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral bypass procedures.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We may have difficulty competing effectively with these competitors because of their well-established positions in the marketplace, significant financial and human capital resources, established reputations and worldwide distribution channels.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	develop more effective or less expensive products or technologies that render our technology or products obsolete or non-competitive.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We have encountered and expect to continue to encounter potential customers who, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to or prefer the products offered by these competitors.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If we are unable to compete successfully, our revenue will suffer.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Increased competition might lead to price reductions and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Competitive pressures may decrease the demand for our products and could adversely affect our financial results.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S5	We have limited commercial manufacturing experience and could experience difficulty in producing the PAD Systems or will need to depend on third parties to manufacture the products.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S6	We have limited experience in commercially manufacturing the PAD Systems and have no experience manufacturing these products in the volume that we anticipate will be required if we achieve planned levels of commercial sales.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S7	As a result, we may not be able to develop and implement efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to manufacture the PAD Systems or future products in significant volumes, while meeting the legal, regulatory, quality, price, durability, engineering, design and production standards required to market our products successfully.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S8	The forecasts of demand we use to determine order quantities and lead times for components purchased from outside suppliers may be incorrect.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S9	Failure to obtain required components or subassemblies when needed and at a reasonable cost would adversely affect our business.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S10	In addition, we may in the future need to depend upon third parties to manufacture the PAD Systems and future products.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S11	Any difficulties in locating and hiring third-party manufacturers, or in the ability of third-party manufacturers to supply quantities of our products at the times and in the quantities we need, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S12	We depend upon third-party suppliers, including single source suppliers to us and our customers, making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S13	We rely on third-party suppliers to provide us with certain components of our products and to provide key components or supplies to our customers for use with our products.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S14	We rely on single source suppliers for certain components of the PAD Systems.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S15	We depend on our suppliers to provide us and our customers with materials in a timely manner that meet our and their quality, quantity and cost requirements.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S16	These suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand and our customers demands.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S17	Any supply interruption from our suppliers or failure to obtain additional suppliers for any of the components used in our products would limit our ability to manufacture our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S18	We may need to increase the size of our organization and we may experience difficulties managing growth.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S19	If we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business, our future revenue and operating results may be adversely affected.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S20	The growth we may experience in the future may provide challenges to our organization, requiring us to rapidly expand our sales and marketing personnel and manufacturing operations.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S21	Rapid expansion in personnel may result in less experienced people producing and selling our products, which could result in unanticipated costs and disruptions to our operations.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S22	If we cannot scale and manage our business appropriately, our anticipated growth may be impaired and our financial results will suffer.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S23	We may require additional financing, and our failure to obtain additional financing when needed could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S24	We may be dependent on additional financing to execute our business plan.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S25	Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	timely basis, we may terminate or delay the development of one or more of our products, or delay establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In the event we need or desire additional financing, we may be unable to obtain it by borrowing money in the credit markets or raising money in the capital markets.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We face a risk of non-compliance with the financial covenants in our loan and security agreements with Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We are party to loan and security agreements with Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P14_S4	These agreements require us to maintain, among other things, a monthly specified liquidity ratio and a monthly adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, level.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P14_S5	The agreements contain customary events of default, including, among others, the failure to comply with certain covenants or other agreements.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, amounts due under the agreements may be accelerated by Silicon Valley Bank or Partners for Growth.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	If we are unable to meet the financial or other covenants under the current loan and security agreements or negotiate future waivers or amendments of such covenants, events of default could occur under the agreements.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the agreements, Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth have available a range of remedies customary in these circumstances, including declaring all outstanding debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to be due and payable, foreclosing on the assets securing the agreements and/or ceasing to provide additional loans, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The restrictive covenants under these agreements could limit our ability to obtain future financing, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	The financial and restrictive covenants contained in the agreements could also adversely affect our ability to respond to changing economic and business conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies that may be subject to fewer restrictions.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Transactions that we may view as important opportunities, such as acquisitions, may be subject to the consent of Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth, which consents may be withheld or granted subject to conditions specified at the time that may affect the attractiveness or viability of the transaction.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S5	We are dependent on our senior management team and highly skilled personnel, and our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain personnel necessary for our success.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S6	We are highly dependent on our senior management.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Our success will depend on our ability to retain senior management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, including scientists, clinicians, engineers and other highly skilled personnel and to integrate current and additional personnel in all departments.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S8	The loss of members of our senior management, scientists, clinical and regulatory specialists, engineers and sales personnel could prevent us from achieving our objectives of continuing to grow the Company.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S9	We do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S10	Our stock price is volatile and subject to significant fluctuations.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S11	The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S12	Market prices for securities of early-stage pharmaceutical, medical device, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S13	Our common stock traded as low as $7.26 and as high as $16.25 per share during the 12-month period ended June 30, 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S14	Factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Moreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Our ability to market the PAD Systems in the United States is limited to use as a therapy in patients with PAD, and if we want to expand our marketing claims, we will need to file for additional FDA clearances or approvals and conduct further clinical trials, which would be expensive and time consuming and may not be successful.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P16_S4	The PAD Systems received FDA 510(k) clearances in the United States for use as a therapy in patients with PAD.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P16_S5	This general clearance restricts our ability to market or advertise the PAD Systems beyond this use and could affect our growth.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P16_S6	If we determine to market our orbital technology in the United States for other uses, for instance, use in the coronary arteries, we would need to conduct further clinical trials and obtain premarket approval from the FDA.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Clinical trials are complex, expensive, time consuming, uncertain and subject to substantial and unanticipated delays.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P16_S8	Any delays in receiving, or failure to receive, FDA approval for a coronary application for the Diamondback 360 would delay or prevent us from accessing a substantial market segment and would have a substantial adverse effect on our potential future revenue.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P16_S9	The PAD Systems may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation and product liability claims that could exceed the limits of available insurance coverage.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material regulatory deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Any recalls of our products or products that we distribute would divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation with customers and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Also, if the PAD Systems are defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contain defective components or are misused, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	The use, misuse or off-label use of the PAD Systems may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We cannot prevent a physician from using the PAD Systems for off-label applications.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P17_S5	While we have product liability insurance coverage for our products and intend to maintain such insurance coverage in the future, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected from the claims that will be brought against us.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P17_S6	We are subject to many laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P17_S7	The PAD Systems and related manufacturing processes, clinical data, adverse events, recalls or corrections and promotional activities are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory bodies.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P17_S8	In particular, we are required to comply with the FDA s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, and other regulations, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product for which we obtain marketing clearance or approval.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P17_S9	We are also responsible for the quality of components received by our suppliers.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P17_S10	Failure to comply with the QSR requirements or other statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or failure to adequately respond to any observations, could result in, among other things:
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales to suffer.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Our operations are also subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	In addition, our relationships with physicians, hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny under various federal anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S4	If our operations are found to be in violation of these laws, we, as well as our employees, may be subject to penalties, including monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration health programs, workers compensation programs and TRICARE (the healthcare system administered by or on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense for uniformed services beneficiaries, including active duty and their dependents, retirees and their dependents), and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could allow our competitors and others to produce products based on our technology, which could substantially impair our ability to compete.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Our success and ability to compete depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S7	We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Our issued patents and related intellectual property may not be adequate to protect us or permit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S9	Also, we cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S10	Further, if any patents we obtain or license are deemed invalid and unenforceable, or have their scope narrowed, it could impact our ability to commercialize or license our technology.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S11	Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S12	In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, if at all.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S13	We may, in the future, need to assert claims of infringement against third parties to protect our intellectual property.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S14	The outcome of litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in patents, copyrights, trade secrets or trademarks is highly unpredictable, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, reputation and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	misappropriation of our technology or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our products, technology or other information that we regard as proprietary.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to litigate, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Additionally, third parties may be able to design around our patents.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P19_S3	We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P19_S4	In this regard, we seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by having a policy that our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P19_S5	We cannot provide any assurance that employees and third parties will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements, or that we will be effective in securing necessary assignments from these third parties.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others could prohibit us from commercializing products, require us to obtain licenses from third parties or require us to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages and injunctive relief.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The medical technology industry is characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The likelihood that patent infringement or misappropriation claims may be brought against us increases as we achieve more visibility in the marketplace and introduce products to market.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We are aware of numerous patents issued to third parties that relate to the manufacture and use of medical devices for interventional cardiology.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The owners of each of these patents could assert that the manufacture, use or sale of our products infringes one or more claims of their patents.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	There could also be existing patents of which we are unaware that one or more aspects of our technology may inadvertently infringe.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In some cases, litigation may be threatened or brought by a patent-holding company or other adverse patent owner who has no relevant product revenues and against whom our patents may provide little or no deterrence.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Any infringement or misappropriation claim could cause us to incur significant costs, place significant strain on our financial resources, divert management s attention from our business and harm our reputation.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P22_S5	If the relevant patents were upheld in litigation as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe, we could be prohibited from commercializing any infringing products unless we could obtain licenses to use the technology covered by the patent or are able to design around the patent.
1180145_12_ITEM1A_P22_S6	We may be unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may not be able to redesign any infringing products to avoid infringement.
1180145_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	leased this facility through November 2015 with an option to renew through November 2020.
1180145_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	This facility accommodates our research and development, sales, marketing, manufacturing, finance and administrative activities.
1180145_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	In September 2009, we entered into an agreement to lease a 46,000 square foot production facility in Pearland, Texas beginning on April 1, 2010.
1180145_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	We have leased this facility through March 2020.
1180145_12_ITEM2_P0_S4	This facility primarily accommodates additional manufacturing activities.
1180145_12_ITEM2_P0_S5	We believe that our current premises are substantially adequate for our current and anticipated future needs for the foreseeable future.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	On October 27, 2009, Dr. Leonid Shturman, CSI-MN s founder, filed a complaint (the First Action ) in the U.S. District Court in Minnesota (the Court ) against us.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	The First Action asserted that our filing of an action in Switzerland against Dr. Shturman violated provisions of a settlement agreement that we and Dr. Shturman entered into in September 2008.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P0_S2	The 2008 settlement resolved a lawsuit we had brought against Dr. Shturman for breach of his employment agreement with us.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P0_S3	Dr. Shturman s complaint sought an award of damages and injunctive relief to bar us from litigating the action in Switzerland.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P0_S4	Dr. Shturman died subsequent to the filing of the complaint.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	Within three months of Dr. Shturman s death, demands for settlement were made on behalf of the sole heir of Dr. Shturman s estate, his wife, Lela Nadirashvili ( Mrs. Shturman ).
1180145_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	Mrs. Shturman filed a writ to dismiss our patent lawsuit in Switzerland based on res judicata and collateral estoppel (the Switzerland Action ).
1180145_12_ITEM3_P1_S2	The judge ruled in our favor regarding the requested writ.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P1_S3	Under the settlement, Mrs. Shturman assigned the patent application in issue to us in exchange for our forgiveness of approximately $3,000 in costs Mrs. Shturman had been ordered to pay.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	In early 2011, the Court issued an order requesting counsel for Dr. Shturman to advise the Court regarding the status of the First Action.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P2_S1	Subsequent to the Court s order, Mrs. Shturman again began making demands for money in exchange for Dr. Shturman s alleged patent portfolio.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P2_S2	We again declined Mrs. Shturman s demands but instead made our own offer of settlement.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P2_S3	Counsel for Mrs. Shturman rejected the offer and instead informed us that they intended to file an amended complaint in the U.S. District Court in Minnesota.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P3_S0	On August 24, 2011, Mrs. Shturman filed a claim against us in the Court seeking a declaration that she is the true owner of certain counterweight patent applications, as well as compensation for wrongful actions she alleges we perpetrated against her and harm resulting from our alleged wrongful actions (the Second Action ).
1180145_12_ITEM3_P3_S1	We filed a motion to dismiss the Second Action on October 20, 2011.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P3_S2	In December 2011, the Court dismissed the Second Action.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P3_S3	The Court found that it did not have jurisdiction over the Second Action and did not address the merits of the claims.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P4_S0	In February 2012, Mrs. Shturman re-filed her lawsuit in Hennepin County District Court (the Third Action ).
1180145_12_ITEM3_P4_S1	We removed the Third Action to federal court.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P5_S0	In the Third Action, Mrs. Shturman sought a declaration that she is the sole owner of six United States patents that have issued naming Dr. Leonid Shturman as the sole inventor.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P5_S1	In addition, Mrs. Shturman asserted claims for slander of title, tortious interference with prospective business relations, and unfair competition.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P5_S2	Mrs. Shturman sought an unspecified sum of damages.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P5_S3	We asserted counterclaims seeking a declaration that the patents are invalid, imposition of a constructive trust, and unjust enrichment damages.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P5_S4	The parties settled the Third Action on August 27, 2012, resolving all claims and disputes between them.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P6_S0	On July 18, 2011, we received a demand letter from legal counsel for Michael Kallok, a former officer, director and consultant to us, claiming that Mr. Kallok is entitled to 42,594 shares of our common stock or, alternatively, the value of those shares as of July 15, 2011, which was $610,798.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P6_S1	Mr. Kallok asserts that we improperly deemed such shares forfeited under a restricted stock agreement with Mr. Kallok.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P6_S2	This matter is proceeding to arbitration, which is scheduled to take place on September 10 and 11, 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P6_S3	We are defending this claim vigorously, and believe that an adverse outcome of this dispute would not have a materially adverse effect on our business, operations, cash flows or financial condition.
1180145_12_ITEM3_P6_S4	We have not recognized any expense related to the settlement of this matter as we believe an adverse outcome of this action is not probable.

1180145_12_ITEM4_P5_S2	Without admitting or denying the SEC s charges, Mr. Flaherty consented to the entry of a court order enjoining him from any violation of certain provisions of federal securities law.

1180145_12_ITEM5_P2_S1	No cash dividends have been previously paid on our common stock and none are anticipated during fiscal year 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM5_P2_S2	We are restricted from paying dividends under our Loan and Security Agreements with Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth.
1180145_12_ITEM5_P2_S3	Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities On June 29, 2012, in connection with and as additional consideration for entering into a Second Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the Amendment ) with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB ), we issued a ten-year warrant to purchase 18,649 shares of our common stock to SVB, which warrant SVB immediately transferred to its parent company, SVB Financial Group.
1180145_12_ITEM5_P2_S4	The warrant s exercise price was set at $9.652 per share, which price was based on the five-day average closing share price of our common stock prior to the date of the Amendment.
1180145_12_ITEM5_P2_S5	The warrant is filed as an exhibit to this annual report on Form 10-K. We issued the warrant pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

1180145_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Replidyne was a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, in-licensing and commercializing anti-infective products.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	CSI was incorporated in Minnesota in 1989.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	From 1989 to 1997, we engaged in research and development on several different product concepts that were later abandoned.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	Since 1997, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development of the PAD Systems.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P3_S4	From 2003 to 2005, we conducted numerous bench and animal tests in preparation for application submissions to the FDA.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P3_S5	We initially focused our testing on providing a solution for coronary in-stent restenosis, but later changed the focus to PAD.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P3_S6	In 2006, we obtained an investigational device exemption from the FDA to conduct our pivotal OASIS clinical trial, which was completed in January 2007.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P3_S7	The OASIS clinical trial was a prospective 20-center study that involved 124 patients with 201 lesions.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P3_S8	In August 2007, the FDA granted us 510(k) clearance for the use of the Diamondback 360 as a therapy in patients with PAD.

1180145_12_ITEM7_P3_S12	We assemble at our facilities the saline infusion pump used with our Stealth 360 product and the single-use catheter used in the PAD Systems with components purchased from third-party suppliers, as well as with components manufactured in-house.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P3_S13	The control unit and guidewires are purchased from third-party suppliers.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P3_S14	As of June 30, 2012, we had an accumulated deficit of $179.2 million.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P3_S15	We expect our losses to continue in fiscal 2013 as we invest in sales, marketing, and clinical studies for our next phase of growth in the peripheral market and a potential coronary application.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P3_S16	To date, we have financed our operations primarily from the issuance of common and preferred stock, convertible promissory notes, and debt.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	We derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of PAD Systems and other ancillary products.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	The PAD Systems each use a disposable, single-use, low-profile catheter that travels over our proprietary ViperWire guidewire.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	The air powered Diamondback 360 and Predator 360 PAD Systems use an external control unit that powers the system, while the electric powered Stealth 360 PAD System uses a saline infusion pump as a power supply for the operation of the catheter.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	Our ancillary products include the ViperSlide Lubricant and ViperTrack Radiopaque Tape.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P5_S3	We also have an exclusive distribution agreement with Asahi to market its peripheral guide wire line in the United States.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P5_S4	We assemble the single-use catheter with components purchased from third-party suppliers, as well as with components manufactured in-house.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P5_S5	The control unit and guidewires are purchased from third-party suppliers.

1180145_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	We have established valuation allowances to fully offset our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty about our ability to generate the future taxable income necessary to realize these deferred assets, particularly in light of our historical losses.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	The future use of net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on us attaining profitable operations and will be limited in any one year under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 due to significant ownership changes (as defined in Section 382) resulting from our equity financings.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	At June 30, 2012, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax reporting purposes of approximately $129.0 million, which will expire at various dates through fiscal 2032.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect amounts reported in those statements.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	Our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, excess and obsolete inventory, debt conversion option, stock-based compensation, and preferred stock warrants are updated as appropriate at least quarterly.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	We use authoritative pronouncements, our technical accounting knowledge, cumulative business experience, judgment and other factors in the selection and application of our accounting policies.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P15_S4	While we believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments that we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements are appropriate, these estimates, assumptions and judgments are subject to factors and uncertainties regarding their outcome.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P15_S5	Therefore, actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Some of our significant accounting policies require us to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	We believe that the following are our critical accounting policies and estimates: Revenue Recognition.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	We sell the majority of our products via direct shipment to hospitals or office-based labs.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	These criteria are generally met at the time of delivery when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	We record estimated sales returns, discounts and rebates as a reduction of net sales in the same period revenue is recognized.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	Costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	Cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P18_S3	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P18_S4	This allowance is an estimate and is regularly evaluated for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience, credit quality of the customer base, age of the receivable balances, both individually and in the aggregate, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P18_S5	Provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts attributed to bad debt are recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	We have inventories that are principally comprised of capitalized direct labor and manufacturing overhead, raw materials and components, and finished goods.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	Due to the technological nature of our products, there is a risk of obsolescence to changes in our technology and the market, which is impacted by technological developments and events.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	Accordingly, we write down our inventories as we become aware of any situation where the carrying amount exceeds the estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future demands and market conditions.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P19_S3	The evaluation includes analyses of inventory levels, expected product lives, product at risk of expiration, sales levels by product and projections of future sales demand.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P19_S4	The fair value of the conversion option is related to the loan and security agreement with Partners for Growth and has been included as a component of debt conversion option and other assets on our balance sheet.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P19_S5	The Monte Carlo option pricing model used to determine the value of the conversion option includes various inputs including historical volatility, stock price simulations, and the assessed behavior of us and Partners for Growth based on those simulations.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	We recognize stock-based compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments computed at the date of grant.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	The fair value of all restricted stock awards and units are expensed in the consolidated statements of operations over the related vesting period.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	All restricted stock awards and units we have granted become exercisable over periods established at the date of grant.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	The fair value of each restricted stock award and unit was equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant, as determined by management and the board of directors.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	In accordance with FASB guidance, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements related to legal proceedings when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	If a loss is possible, but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P22_S3	In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P22_S4	Our significant legal proceedings are discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands), and, for certain line items, the changes between the specified periods expressed as percent increases or decreases: Comparison of Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2012 with Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2011 Revenues.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	Revenues increased by $3.7 million, or 4.7%, from $78.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2011 to $82.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	This increase was primarily attributable to a $3.7 million, or 5.4%, increase driven by increased average selling prices of PAD Systems during the year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the year ended June 30, 2011.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	Currently, all of our revenues are in the United States; however, we may potentially sell internationally in the future.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P24_S3	We expect our revenue to increase as we continue to increase the number of physicians using the devices, and increase the usage per physician as we continue to focus on physician education programs, introduce new and improved products, and generate clinical data.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P24_S4	Cost of goods sold increased by $2.9 million, or 18.1%, from $16.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2011 to $19.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2012.

1180145_12_ITEM7_P24_S6	The decrease in gross margin from 79.3% during the year ended June 30, 2011 to 76.7% for the year ended June 30, 2012 was primarily due to a higher mix of Stealth 360 sales, which currently carry higher unit costs due to limited initial component purchasing volumes, and reserves for inventory transitions.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P24_S7	Also, the addition of our second manufacturing facility in Texas for future production capacity has temporarily increased production costs but we believe will enhance efficiencies over time.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P24_S8	Cost of goods sold for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 includes $296,000 and $312,000, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	that gross margin in fiscal 2013 will be similar to fiscal 2012 as cost improvements made throughout the year will be offset by the 2.3% medical device tax, effective January 1, 2013.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Quarterly fluctuations could occur based on production volumes, timing of new product introductions, sales mix, pricing changes, or other unanticipated circumstances.

1180145_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	Selling, general, and administrative expense increased by $4.0 million, or 6.4%, from $62.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2011 to $66.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2012 have increased due to the expansion of our marketing organization, increased variable compensation, and increased medical education programs, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 includes $4.4 million and $5.6 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P27_S4	We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as a result of the costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing organization and programs to further commercialize our products and prepare for a potential future coronary application.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P27_S5	Research and development expenses increased by $2.4 million, or 27.2%, from $8.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2011 to $11.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2012.

1180145_12_ITEM7_P27_S7	The increase in these expenses related to advancement of the ORBIT II coronary trial, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P27_S8	Research and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 includes $474,000 and $587,000, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P27_S9	As we continue to expand our product portfolio within the market for the treatment of peripheral arteries and leverage our core technology into the coronary market, we generally expect to incur research and development expenses above amounts incurred for the year ended June 30, 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P27_S10	Fluctuations could occur based on the number of projects and studies and the timing of expenditures.

1180145_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	Net loss available to common stockholders for the year ended June 30, 2011 was $11.1 million, or $0.70 per basic and diluted share, compared to $23.9 million, or $1.62 per basic and diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2010.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION To supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, our management uses a non-GAAP financial measure referred to as Adjusted EBITDA.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands):
1180145_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA of $6.8 million, or 418.7%, is primarily the result of the $5.7 million, or 64.2%, increase in the loss from operations.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	The loss from operations was significantly impacted by increases in operating expenses.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	Adjusted EBITDA was also impacted by a decrease in stock-based compensation and increase in depreciation and amortization.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P40_S3	Stock-based compensation decreased $1.3 million, or 20.1%, from $6.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2011 to $5.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P40_S4	Stock-based compensation decreased as a result of the timing and market price of previously granted shares that became fully vested.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P40_S5	Depreciation and amortization increased as a result of additional investment in capital equipment.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P40_S6	We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of performance and believe this measure facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by factoring out potential differences caused by depreciation and amortization expense and non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P40_S7	Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA to analyze the underlying trends in our business, assess the performance of our core operations, establish operational goals and forecasts that are used to allocate resources and evaluate our performance period over period and in relation to our competitors operating results.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P40_S8	Additionally, our management is partially evaluated on the basis of Adjusted EBITDA when determining achievement of their incentive compensation performance targets.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P40_S9	We believe that presenting Adjusted EBITDA provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P40_S10	We also believe that providing this information better enables our investors to understand our operating performance and evaluate the methodology used by our management to evaluate and measure such performance.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P40_S11	Adjusted EBITDA is also used to measure performance in our financial covenants as required by Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P40_S12	The following is an explanation of each of the items that management excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and the reasons for excluding each of these individual items:
1180145_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP financial measures primarily because such expense, while constituting an ongoing and recurring expense, is not an expense that requires cash settlement.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	Our management also believes that excluding this item from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand its impact on our operational performance, liquidity and ability to make additional investments in the Company, and it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	expenses, are not expenses that require cash settlement and are not used by our management to assess the core profitability of our business operations.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	Our management also believes that excluding these items from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand our operational performance, liquidity and ability to make additional investments in the Company.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	Material Limitations Associated with the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Manner in which We Compensate for these Limitations Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	Some of the limitations associated with our use of these non-GAAP financial measures are:
1180145_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Items such as stock-based compensation do not directly affect our cash flow position; however, such items reflect economic costs to us and are not reflected in our Adjusted EBITDA and therefore these non-GAAP measures do not reflect the full economic effect of these items.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore other companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Our management exercises judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures we use.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily upon our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	We had cash and cash equivalents of $35.5 million and $21.2 million at June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P45_S3	During the year ended June 30, 2012, net cash used in operations amounted to $11.3 million.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P45_S4	As of June 30, 2012, we had an accumulated deficit of $179.2 million.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P45_S5	We have historically funded our operating losses primarily from the issuance of common and preferred stock, convertible promissory notes, debt, and the merger with Replidyne in February 2009.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank On March 29, 2010, we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	The agreement was amended on December 27, 2011 to increase outstanding borrowings, and subsequently amended on June 29, 2012 to modify financial covenants and reduce the interest rate and other fees.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	The agreement, as amended, includes a $12.0 million term loan and a $15.0 million line of credit.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P46_S3	The terms of each of these loans are as follows:
1180145_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	The $12.0 million term loan has an initial interest rate of 8.0%, which can be reduced to 7.0% based on the achievement of positive EBITDA for the trailing six month period.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	The term loan has a 36 month maturity, with repayment terms that include interest only payments during the first six months, followed by 30 equal principal payments of $400,000 plus interest, and a final payment of $100,000 due at maturity.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	This term loan also includes an acceleration provision that requires us to pay the entire outstanding balance, plus a penalty ranging from 1.0% to 3.0% of the commitment amount, upon prepayment or the occurrence and continuance of an event of default.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P47_S3	The balance outstanding on the term loan at June 30, 2012, including the unamortized discount, was $11.7 million.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P47_S4	The unamortized discount associated with warrants issued to Silicon Valley Bank in connection with the loan and other fees paid to the lender will be amortized over the 36 month maturity period.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	The $15.0 million line of credit expires on June 30, 2014 and has a floating interest rate equal to the Wall Street Journal s prime rate, plus 1.25%, with an interest rate floor of 4.5%.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	Interest on borrowings is due monthly and the principal balance is due at maturity.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	Borrowings on the line of credit are based on 85% of eligible accounts.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	The line of credit is subject to non-use fees, annual fees, and cancellation fees.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	There was not an outstanding balance on the line of credit at June 30, 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	Borrowings from Silicon Valley Bank are secured by all of our assets.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P49_S3	The borrowings are subject to prepayment penalties and financial covenants, including maintaining certain liquidity and fixed charge coverage ratios, and certain three-month EBITDA targets.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P49_S4	We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of June 30, 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P49_S5	The agreement also includes subjective acceleration clauses that permit Silicon Valley Bank to accelerate the due date under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, material adverse effects on our financial status or otherwise.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P49_S6	Any non-compliance by us under the terms of debt arrangements could result in an event of default under the Silicon Valley Bank loan, which, if not cured, could result in the acceleration of this debt.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	In connection with and as additional consideration for entering into the amendment to the amended and restated loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank on December 27, 2011, we issued a warrant to purchase 12,760 shares of our common stock to Silicon Valley Bank, which Silicon Valley Bank immediately transferred to its parent company, SVB Financial Group.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	The warrant s exercise price was set at $9.796 per share, which price was based on the five-day average closing share price of our common stock prior to the date of the amendment.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	The warrant expires on the tenth anniversary of the issue date, subject to earlier expiration in accordance with its terms.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	In connection with and as additional consideration for entering into the subsequent amendment to the amended and restated loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank on June 29, 2012, we issued a warrant to purchase 18,649 shares of our common stock to Silicon Valley Bank, which Silicon Valley Bank immediately transferred to its parent company, SVB Financial Group.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	The warrant s exercise price was set at $9.652 per share, which price was based on the five-day average closing share price of our common stock prior to the date of the amendment.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	The warrant expires on the tenth anniversary of the issue date, subject to earlier expiration in accordance with its terms.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	Loan and Security Agreement with Partners for Growth On April 14, 2010, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Partners for Growth III, L.P. (PFG).
1180145_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	The agreement was amended on August 23, 2011 to provide that PFG will make loans to us up to $5.0 million, December 27, 2011 to raise the total amount of indebtedness that we may accrue under the term loan portion of the amended and restated loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank from $10.0 million to $12.0 million, and June 30, 2012 to modify financial covenants.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	The amended agreement provides that PFG will make loans to us up to $5.0 million.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	The agreement has a maturity date of April 14, 2015.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P52_S4	The loans bear interest at a floating per annum rate equal to 2.75% above Silicon Valley Bank s prime rate, and such interest is payable monthly.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P52_S5	The principal balance of and any accrued and unpaid interest on any notes are due on the maturity date and may not be prepaid by us at any time in whole or in part.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	As of June 30, 2012, PFG has provided us the following three loans totaling $5.0 million that are outstanding: (i) a $3.5 million loan dated June 30, 2011 with a conversion price of $13.64, (ii) a $500,000 loan dated August 4, 2011, as amended and restated August 24, 2011, with a conversion price of $15.30, and (iii) a $1.0 million loan dated August 24, 2011 with a conversion price of $13.42.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	At any time prior to the maturity date, PFG may at its option convert any of the outstanding loans into shares of our common stock at the applicable conversion price, which in each case equaled the ten-day volume weighted average price per share of our common stock prior to the issuance date of each note.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	We may also effect at any time a mandatory conversion of amounts, subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations provided in the agreement, including a requirement that the ten-day volume weighted average price of our common stock prior to the date of conversion is at least 15% greater than the conversion price.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	We may reduce the conversion price to a price that represents a 15% discount to the ten-day volume weighted average price of our common stock to satisfy this condition and effect a mandatory conversion.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P54_S3	During the year ended June 30, 2012, PFG, at its option, converted a $500,000 loan (at par) into 40,323 shares of our common stock in accordance with the conversion terms set forth in the agreement.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	write-off of the conversion option on the converted loan, (ii) the write-off of the unamortized debt premium on the converted loan and (iii) the change in fair value of the conversion options on all outstanding loans.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	The balance outstanding under the loan and security agreement at June 30, 2012 was $5.6 million.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	The net unamortized premium associated with warrants issued to PFG in connection with the loan, a beneficial conversion feature, and other fees paid to the lender will be amortized over the remaining maturity period.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	The loans are secured by certain of our assets, and the agreement contains customary covenants limiting our ability to, among other things, incur debt or liens, make certain investments and loans, effect certain redemptions of and declare and pay certain dividends on its stock, permit or suffer certain change of control transactions, dispose of collateral, or change the nature of its business.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	In addition, the PFG loan and security agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain certain liquidity and fixed charge coverage ratios and certain three-month EBITDA targets.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P56_S2	We were in compliance with all financial covenants at June 30, 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P56_S3	If we do not comply with the various covenants, PFG may, subject to various customary cure rights, decline to provide additional loans, require amortization of the loan over its remaining term, or require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the loan and foreclose on any or all collateral, depending on which financial covenants are not maintained.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	In connection with the initial agreement in April 2010, we issued PFG a warrant to purchase 66,299 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $5.43 per share.

1180145_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	One-half of each warrant was immediately exercisable, and the remaining half became exercisable as additional funds were drawn during the year ended June 30, 2011.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P57_S3	The warrants were exercised in June 2011.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P57_S4	In connection with and as additional consideration for entering into the amendment to the loan and security agreement with PFG on December 27, 2011, we issued one warrant to purchase 23,151 shares of our common stock to PFG, one warrant to purchase 3,396 shares of our common stock to PFG Equity Investors, LLC, an affiliate of PFG, and one warrant to purchase 24,900 shares of our common stock to Silicon Valley Bank.

1180145_12_ITEM7_P57_S6	Cash and cash equivalents was $35.5 million and $21.2 million at June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P57_S7	This increase is primarily attributable to net proceeds from our equity financing in May 2012 and refinancing of long-term debt, partially offset by cash used in operations during the year ended June 30, 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P57_S8	Net cash used in operating activities was $11.3 million, $8.4 million, and $13.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P57_S9	For the years ended June 30, 2012, 2011, and 2010, we had a net loss of $16.8 million, $11.1 million, and $23.9 million, respectively.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P57_S10	Changes in working capital accounts also contributed to the net cash used in the years ended June 30, 2012, 2011, and 2010.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P57_S11	Significant changes in working capital during these periods included:
1180145_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	Cash provided by (used in) accrued expenses and other liabilities of $7,000, ($2.4 million), and $3.8 million during the years ended June 30, 2012, 2011, and 2010 respectively.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	For the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, cash used in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily related to the timing and payment of accruals.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	For the year ended June 30, 2010, cash provided by accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily due to receipt of $3.5 million in net cash incentives under the agreement to establish a manufacturing facility in Texas.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P58_S3	Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities was ($975,000), ($1.7 million), and $21.8 million for the years ended June 30, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P58_S4	For the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, cash used in investing activities resulted from investment in property, plant and equipment, and patents.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P58_S5	For the year ended June 30, 2010, cash provided by investing activities primarily resulted from the selling of investments in the amount of $23.0 million.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P58_S6	Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $26.7 million, $7.5 million, and ($17.9 million) during the years ended June 30, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P58_S7	Cash provided by financing activities during these periods included:
1180145_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	Cash used in financing activities in these periods included payments on long-term debt of $1.9 million, $2.4 million, and $25.3 million during the years ended June 30, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	Our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including the extent and duration of future operating losses, the level and timing of future sales and expenditures, the results and scope of ongoing research and product development programs, working capital required to support our sales growth, the receipt of and time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals, our sales and marketing programs, the continuing acceptance of our products in the marketplace, competing technologies and market and regulatory developments.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	As of June 30, 2012, we believe our current cash and cash equivalents and available debt will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and operations for at least the next 12 months.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P60_S2	We intend to retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P60_S3	We may raise additional capital in the future, to fund acceleration of our current growth initiatives or additional growth opportunities, if we believe it will significantly enhance our value.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P60_S4	Our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of June 30, 2012 are summarized below:
1180145_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	(1) The amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum payments under a non-cancellable operating lease for our office and production facility along with equipment.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	(2) This amount reflects open purchase orders.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	(3) The amounts reflected in the table above represents debt maturities under various debt agreements.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	INFLATION We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business and operating results during the periods presented.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Since inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet activities as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In May 2011, the FASB issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements on fair value measurements.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	The new guidance limits the highest-and-best-use measure to nonfinancial assets, permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis, and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P64_S3	Additionally, the new guidance expands the disclosures on Level 3 inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions, as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P64_S4	The new guidance became effective for us beginning January 1, 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P64_S5	Other than requiring additional disclosures, there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance requiring that all non-owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income, and the total of comprehensive income.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P65_S2	The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P65_S3	Other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption as we have no other comprehensive income.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements.
1180145_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	Such forward-looking information is included in this Form 10-K and in other materials filed or to be filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us).
1180145_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	Forward-looking statements include all statements based on future expectations.

1180145_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk or availability.
1180145_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	To achieve these objectives, our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of marketable securities, including money market funds, U.S. government securities, and certain bank obligations.

1180145_12_ITEM8_P0_S1	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of changes in shareholders equity (deficiency) and comprehensive loss and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. at June 30, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P0_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1180145_12_ITEM8_P0_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P0_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits (which were integrated audits in 2012 and 2011).
1180145_12_ITEM8_P0_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1180145_12_ITEM8_P0_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P0_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P0_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P0_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P0_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P1_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P1_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1180145_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	Customer credit terms are established prior to shipment with the general standard being net 30 days.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P12_S1	Collateral or any other security to support payment of these receivables generally is not required.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P12_S2	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P12_S3	This allowance is an estimate and is regularly evaluated by the Company for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience, credit quality of the customer base, age of the receivable balances, both individually and in the aggregate, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P12_S4	Provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts attributed to bad debt are recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P12_S5	The following table shows allowance for doubtful accounts activity for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011:
1180145_12_ITEM8_P13_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method of valuation.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P14_S0	The establishment of inventory allowances for excess and obsolete inventories is based on estimated exposure on specific inventory items.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment is carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P15_S1	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of five years for production equipment and furniture and fixtures; three years for computer equipment and software; and the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term for leasehold improvements.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P15_S2	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs and minor renewals and betterments which do not extend or improve the life of the respective assets are expensed as incurred.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P15_S3	All other expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P15_S4	The assets and related depreciation accounts are adjusted for property retirements and disposals with the resulting gains or losses included in the consolidated statement of operations.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	The capitalized costs incurred to obtain patents are amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P16_S1	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	The recoverability of capitalized patent costs is dependent upon the Company s ability to derive revenue-producing products from such patents or the ultimate sale or licensing of such patent rights.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P17_S1	Patents that are abandoned are written off at the time of abandonment.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P18_S1	The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated by the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company leases manufacturing and office space under operating lease agreements.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P19_S1	The leases contain rent escalation clauses for which the lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases.

1180145_12_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P20_S2	These criteria are generally met at the time of delivery when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company records estimated sales returns, discounts and rebates as a reduction of net sales in the same period revenue is recognized.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P21_S1	Costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P21_S2	Cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	Warranty Costs The Company provides its customers with the right to receive a replacement if a product is determined to be defective at the time of shipment.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P22_S1	Warranty reserve provisions are estimated based on Company experience, volume, and expected warranty claims.

1180145_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P23_S1	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	regulations and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P24_S1	The Company s judgment and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P24_S2	Existing accounting guidance requires that accounting for uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in the financial statements.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P24_S3	The guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P24_S4	Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P24_S5	The guidance also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.

1180145_12_ITEM8_P25_S3	Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	Approved patent applications are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P26_S1	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P27_S1	The Company maintains its cash balances primarily with one financial institution.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P27_S2	At times, these balances exceed federally insured limits.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P27_S3	The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in cash and cash equivalents.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments Under the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P28_S1	The authoritative guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P29_S1	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	The categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	The following table sets forth the fair value of the Company s financial instruments that were measured on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P31_S1	Assets are measured on a recurring basis if they are remeasured at least annually:
1180145_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	The fair value of the conversion option is related to the loan and security agreement with Partners for Growth (described in Note 3) and has been included as a component of debt conversion option and other assets on the accompanying balance sheet.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P32_S1	The Monte Carlo option pricing model used to determine the value of the conversion option included various inputs including historical volatility, stock price simulations, and assessed behavior of the Company and Partners for Growth based on those simulations.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P32_S2	Based upon these inputs, the Company considers the conversion option to be a Level 3 investment.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P32_S3	As of June 30, 2012, the Company believes that the carrying amounts of its other financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P32_S4	The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value based on interest rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	The preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P33_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments computed at the date of grant.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P34_S1	The fair value of all stock option and restricted stock awards are expensed in the consolidated statements of operations ratably over the related vesting period.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements on fair value measurements.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P35_S1	The new guidance limits the highest-and-best-use measure to nonfinancial assets, permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis, and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	assumptions, as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	The new guidance became effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P36_S2	Other than requiring additional disclosures, there was no material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance requiring that all non-owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P37_S1	In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income, and the total of comprehensive income.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P37_S2	The new guidance will be effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P37_S3	Other than requiring additional disclosures, the Company does not anticipate material impacts on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption as the Company has no other comprehensive income.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	As of June 30, 2012, future estimated amortization of patents and patent licenses will be:
1180145_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	This future amortization expense is an estimate.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	Actual amounts may vary from these estimated amounts due to additional intangible asset acquisitions, potential impairment, accelerated amortization or other events.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank On March 29, 2010, the Company entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	The agreement was amended on December 27, 2011 to increase outstanding borrowings, and subsequently amended on June 29, 2012 to modify financial covenants and reduce the interest rate and other fees.

1180145_12_ITEM8_P40_S3	The terms of each of these loans are as follows:
1180145_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	The $12,000 term loan has an initial interest rate of 8.0%, which can be reduced to 7.0% based on the achievement of positive EBITDA for the trailing six month period.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P41_S1	The term loan has a 36 month maturity, with repayment terms that include interest only payments during the first six months, followed by 30 equal principal payments of $400 plus interest, and a final payment of $100 due at maturity.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P41_S2	This term loan also includes an acceleration provision that requires the Company to pay the entire outstanding balance, plus a penalty ranging from 1.0% to 3.0% of the commitment amount, upon prepayment or the occurrence and continuance of an event of default.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P41_S3	The balance outstanding on the term loan at June 30, 2012 and 2011 was $11,694 and $7,286, respectively, net of the unamortized discount associated with warrants issued to Silicon Valley Bank in connection with the loan.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P41_S4	The unamortized discount associated with warrants and other fees paid to the lender will be amortized over the 36 month maturity period.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P41_S5	See Note 6 for additional information.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	The $15,000 line of credit expires on June 30, 2014 and has a floating interest rate equal to the Wall Street Journal s prime rate, plus 1.25%, with an interest rate floor of 4.5%.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	Interest on borrowings is due monthly and the principal balance is due at maturity.

1180145_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	The line of credit is subject to non-use fees, annual fees, and cancellation fees.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P43_S1	There was not an outstanding balance on the line of credit at June 30, 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	Borrowings from Silicon Valley Bank are secured by all of the Company s assets.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P44_S1	The borrowings are subject to prepayment penalties and financial covenants, including maintaining certain liquidity and fixed charge coverage ratios, and certain three-month EBITDA targets.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P44_S2	The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of June 30, 2012.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P44_S3	The agreement also includes subjective acceleration clauses that permit Silicon Valley Bank to accelerate the due date under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, material adverse effects on the Company s financial status or otherwise.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P44_S4	Any non-compliance by the Company under the terms of debt arrangements could result in an event of default under the Silicon Valley Bank loan, which, if not cured, could result in the acceleration of this debt.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	In connection with and as additional consideration for entering into the amendment to the amended and restated loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank on December 27, 2011, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 12,760 shares of its common stock to Silicon Valley Bank, which Silicon Valley Bank immediately transferred to its parent company, SVB Financial Group.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P45_S1	The warrant s exercise price was set at $9.796 per share, which price was based on the five-day average closing share price of the Company s common stock prior to the date of the amendment.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P45_S2	The warrant expires on the tenth anniversary of the issue date, subject to earlier expiration in accordance with its terms.

1180145_12_ITEM8_P96_S0	Michael Kallok Claim On July 18, 2011, the Company received a demand letter from legal counsel for Michael Kallok, a former officer, director and consultant to the Company, claiming that Mr. Kallok is entitled to 42,594 shares of the Company s common stock or, alternatively, the value of those shares as of July 15, 2011, which was $610,798.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P96_S1	Mr. Kallok asserts that the Company improperly deemed such shares forfeited under a restricted stock agreement with Mr. Kallok.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P96_S2	This matter is proceeding to arbitration, which is scheduled to take place on September 10 and 11, 2012.

1180145_12_ITEM8_P96_S4	The Company has not recognized any expense related to the settlement of this matter as it believes an adverse outcome of this action is not probable.
1180145_12_ITEM8_P97_S0	The following table presents a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used in the basic and diluted earnings per common share computations:

1180145_12_ITEM8_P98_S1	The effect of the shares that would be issued upon conversion of these debt agreements has been excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share because those shares are anti-dilutive.

1180145_12_ITEM15_P30_S10	The Compensation Committee also has authority to grant additional discretionary cash bonuses of up to 20% of annual base salary for any executive officer.

1180145_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	We were incorporated as Replidyne, Inc. in Delaware in 2000.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	On February 25, 2009, Replidyne, Inc. completed its business combination with Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., a Minnesota corporation ( CSI-MN ), in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of November 3, 2008, by and among Replidyne, Responder Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Replidyne ( Merger Sub ), and CSI-MN (the Merger Agreement ).
1180145_13_ITEM1_P2_S2	Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into CSI-MN, with CSI-MN continuing after the merger as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Replidyne.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P2_S3	At the effective time of the merger, Replidyne changed its name to Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. and CSI-MN changed its name to CSI Minnesota, Inc.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P2_S4	Following the merger of Merger Sub with CSI-MN, CSI-MN merged with and into CSI, with CSI continuing after the merger as the surviving corporation.

1180145_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	We are a medical device company focused on developing and commercializing minimally invasive treatment solutions for vascular disease.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	Interventional endovascular treatment of peripheral artery disease, or PAD, is our initial area of focus.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P4_S2	PAD is caused by the accumulation of plaque in peripheral arteries, most commonly occurring in the pelvis and legs.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P4_S3	PAD is a progressive disease, and, if left untreated, can lead to limb amputation or death.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our primary products, the Stealth 360 PAD System ( Stealth 360 ), Diamondback 360 PAD System ( Diamondback 360 ), and Diamondback Predator 360 PAD System ( Predator 360 ), are catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of plaque types in leg arteries both above and below the knee and address many of the limitations associated with existing treatment alternatives.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	We refer to the Stealth 360 , the Diamondback 360 , and the Predator 360 collectively in this annual report as the PAD Systems.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	In August 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted us 510(k) clearance for the use of the Diamondback 360 as a therapy in patients with PAD.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	We commenced commercial introduction of the Diamondback 360 in the United States in September 2007.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	We received 510(k) clearance of the Predator 360 in March 2009 and commenced a commercial launch in April 2009.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P6_S3	We received 510(k) clearance of the Stealth 360 in March 2011 and commenced a commercial launch that same month.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P6_S4	The Stealth 360 contains additional ease of use and physician control features while incorporating the orbital mechanism of action and crown configurations of the Diamondback 360 and Predator 360 .
1180145_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	As of June 30, 2013, nearly 120,000 of our devices had been sold to leading institutions across the United States.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	We intend to expand into the interventional coronary market, though we need to receive FDA approval to do so.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	In May 2011, we received approval from the FDA to complete enrollment of 429 patients in our ORBIT II clinical trial for a coronary application for the Diamondback 360 , which followed the FDA's review of data from the first 50 cases in the trial.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	In July 2012, we received approval from the FDA to include in the trial our new electric coronary device (similar to Stealth 360 technology used in PAD and customized specifically for the coronary application), which improves ease of use.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P8_S3	The FDA required 100 enrollments with the new electric coronary device and allowed up to 50 additional patients in the trial, as needed, to achieve that enrollment level, bringing the maximum trial enrollment to 479.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	During our second quarter of fiscal 2013, we completed enrollment in our ORBIT II trial, enrolling 443 patients.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our ORBIT II trial evaluated the safety and effectiveness of our orbital atherectomy technology in treating severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	Statistical analysis shows that the study met its primary safety and efficacy endpoints by significant margins.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	In March 2013, we presented data from our ORBIT II trial at the 2013 American College of Cardiology conference.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	We and the FDA agreed to a modular pre-market approval, or PMA, submission.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P10_S2	Modules 1 (preclinical) and 2 (manufacturing/quality system) were submitted to the FDA in late 2012, and our PMA application was final upon submission on March 15, 2013 of module 3, which included ORBIT II clinical data and proposed labeling.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	It is estimated that moderate to severe arterial calcium is present in approximately 38% of those treated annually for coronary artery disease.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	ORBIT II is the first investigational device exemption, or IDE, trial designed to study these difficult-to-treat patients with severely calcified coronary disease.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	In addition to the PAD Systems, we have expanded our product portfolio through internal product development and establishment of business relationships with other medical device companies.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	We offer multiple accessory products designed to complement the use of the PAD Systems, and we have an exclusive distribution agreement with Asahi-Intecc Co., Ltd. to market its peripheral guidewire line in the United States.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	PAD is a circulatory problem in which plaque deposits build up on the walls of the arteries, resulting in inadequate blood flow to the limbs.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	Arteries above the knee are generally long, straight and relatively wide, while arteries below the knee are shorter and branch into arteries that are progressively smaller in diameter.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	The most common early symptoms of PAD are pain, cramping or fatigue in the leg or hip muscles while walking.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	Symptoms may progress to include numbness, tingling or weakness in the leg and, in severe cases, burning or aching pain in the leg, foot or toes while resting.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P16_S2	As PAD progresses, additional signs and symptoms occur, including cooling or color changes in the skin of the legs or feet, and wounds or sores on the legs or feet that will not heal.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	If left untreated, PAD may continue to progress and lead to a condition called Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI), a condition in which the amount of oxygenated blood being delivered to the limb is insufficient to keep the tissue alive.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	CLI may lead to large non-healing ulcers, infections, gangrene and limb amputation or death.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	There are two primary bases for estimating PAD prevalence: the patient Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) or diabetes rates.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	The most recent comprehensive study based on ABI estimates the U.S. prevalence at 8.5 million (Allison et al, Ethnic-Specific Prevalence of Peripheral Arterial Disease in the United States, Circulation, 2007).
1180145_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	Today, in a 2006 article, estimated the prevalence of PAD in the United States at 12 million people.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P18_S3	Alternatively, a study by The SAGE Group based on the diabetes method estimates prevalence at 17.6 million in 2010.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P18_S4	An aging population, coupled with increasing incidence of diabetes and obesity, is likely to continue to increase the prevalence of PAD.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	In many older PAD patients, particularly those with diabetes, PAD is characterized by fibrotic (moderately hard) or calcified (extremely hard) plaque deposits that are very challenging to treat.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	Although we believe the rate of diagnosis of PAD is increasing, under-diagnosis continues due to patients failing to display symptoms or physicians misinterpreting symptoms as normal aging.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	Emphasis on PAD education from industry, medical associations, insurance companies and other groups, coupled with publications in medical journals and public news channels, is increasing physician and patient awareness of PAD risk factors, symptoms, and treatment options.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	As a result of additional clinical trial outcomes, new 2011 guidelines of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association lowered the recommended age for testing for PAD from 70 to 65, or 50 if patient has a history of smoking or diabetes.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	Physicians treat a significant portion of the PAD diagnosed population using medical management, which includes lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise and drug treatment.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	For instance, within a reference group of more than 1,000 patients from the 2001 AMA PARTNERS study, 54% of the patients with a prior diagnosis of PAD were receiving antiplatelet medication treatment.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	While medications, diet and exercise may improve blood flow, they do not treat the underlying obstruction and many patients have difficulty maintaining lifestyle changes.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	Additionally, many prescribed medications are contraindicated, or inadvisable, for patients with heart disease, which often exists in PAD patients.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P22_S2	As a result of these challenges, many medically managed patients develop more severe symptoms that require procedural intervention.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	Based on data from the Millennium Research Group s U.S. Markets for Interventional Cardiology Devices 2011 Report, approximately 1.1 million percutaneous coronary interventions, or PCI, procedures were projected to occur in the United States in 2012.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	Based on the article in Circulation in 1995 entitled Patterns of Calcification in Coronary Artery Disease, 38% of PCI procedures involve moderate to severe levels of calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	Patients with severely calcified coronary disease may benefit from the use of our device if approved for commercial use.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P23_S3	In addition, based on Millennium Research Group s Coronary Bypass Graft 2010 Report, approximately 288,620 coronary artery bypass graft surgeries were performed in the United States in 2010.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P23_S4	These patients generally have higher rates of calcification and we believe they may benefit from the use of our device if approved for commercial use.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	The PAD Systems each use a single-use, low-profile catheter that travels over our proprietary ViperWire Advance Guide Wire and is powered by either a saline infusion pump (Stealth 360 ) or an external control unit (Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 ).
1180145_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	a sheath, which covers the drive shaft and permits delivery of saline or medications to the treatment area.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	The ViperWire Advance is the second generation of the ViperWire.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	The ViperWire Advance was designed to offer an improved ability to maneuver through tortuous, twisting blood vessels and cross challenging lesions.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	The PAD Systems travel over this wire to the lesion and operate on this wire.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	ViperSlide is an exclusive lubricant designed to optimize the smooth operation of the PAD Systems.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	Used exclusively with the Stealth 360 , the saline infusion pump mounts directly to the intravenous pole and bathes the device's shaft and crown and provides an electric power supply for the operation of the catheter.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	The constant flow of saline reduces the risk of heat generation and improves the flush of particulates.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	Used in conjunction with the Diamondback 360 and Predator 360 PAD Systems, the control unit incorporates a touch-screen interface on an easily maneuverable pole.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	Using an external air supply, the control unit regulates air pressure to drive the turbine located in the catheter handle to speeds ranging up to 200,000 revolutions per minute.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P30_S2	Saline, delivered by a pumping mechanism on the control unit, bathes the device shaft and crown.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P30_S3	The constant flow of saline reduces the risk of heat generation and improves the flush of particulates.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	The PAD Systems were designed to allow the devices to differentiate between soft compliant and harder diseased tissue in the artery.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	Arterial lesions tend to be harder and stiffer than compliant, undiseased vessel tissue, and they often are fibrotic or calcified.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	The diamond grit coated crown preferentially engages and sands the harder material, but is designed not to damage more compliant parts of the artery.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P31_S3	The PAD Systems also treat soft plaque, which is still harder than a normal vessel wall.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	The mechanism of action is a function of the centrifugal force generated by the PAD Systems as they rotate.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	As the crown moves outward, the centrifugal force is offset by the counterforce exerted by the arterial wall.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	If the tissue is compliant, it flexes away, rather than generating an opposing force that would allow the PAD Systems to engage and sand the wall.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	Diseased tissue provides resistance and is able to generate an opposing force that allows the PAD Systems to engage and sand the plaque.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	The sanded plaque is broken down into particles generally smaller than circulating red blood cells that are washed away downstream with the patient's natural blood flow.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P33_S2	Testing performed in carbon blocks, animal and cadaver models showed:
1180145_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	greater than 99% of particles were smaller than the lumen of the capillaries (which provide the connection between the arterial and venous system).
1180145_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	The small particle size minimizes the risk of vascular bed overload, or a saturation of the peripheral vessels with large particles, which may cause slow or reduced blood flow to the foot.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	The small size of the particles allows them to be managed by the body's natural cleansing of the blood, whereby various types of white blood cells eliminate worn-out cells and other debris in the bloodstream.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	The systems operate on the principles of centrifugal force.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	As the speed of the crown's rotation increases, it creates centrifugal force, which increases the crown's orbit and presses the diamond grit coated offset crown against the lesion or plaque, removing a small amount of plaque with each orbit.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	The characteristics of the orbit and the resulting lumen size can be adjusted by modifying three variables:
1180145_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	An increase in speed creates a larger orbital circle, thus accommodating larger diameter vessels.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our current Stealth 360 system allows the user to choose between three rotational speeds.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	The crown can be designed with various weights (as determined by crown geometry and material density) and coated with diamond grit.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	The crown is available in two configurations - classic and solid.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P41_S2	Physicians select crown sizes and configurations based on several case criteria, including reference vessel size, lesion length and degree of stenosis, stenosis morphology, and anatomy tortuosity.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P41_S3	Physicians often use the classic crown configuration in small, more tortuous vessels or when less aggressive sanding is desired.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P41_S4	The solid crown configuration is designed with a tapered, leading edge for frontal sanding, which can be used in tight calcified disease.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	The Stealth 360 device is available with a 1.50 millimeter and 2.00 millimeter classic crown, and 1.25 millimeter, 1.50 millimeter and 2.00 millimeter solid crown configuration.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P42_S1	There is also a 1.25 millimeter solid micro crown available with the Stealth 360 device, which is designed to provide hybrid performance between the classic and solid configurations and treat very small arteries in the lower leg and foot.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P42_S2	For both configurations, the catheter length is 145 centimeters, which addresses procedural approach and target lesion locations both above and below the knee.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	The Diamondback 360 utilizes the classic crown and the Predator 360 utilizes the solid crown.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	Both systems are available in multiple sizes, including 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, and 2.00 millimeter.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P43_S2	There is also a 2.25 millimeter Predator 360 device.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	The PAD Systems are versatile in that by adjusting one or more of the speeds in conjunction with crown selection, multiple lesions and vessel sizes can be treated.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	The PAD Systems can be used to treat plaque in multiple anatomic locations.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	Below-the-Knee and Behind-the-Knee Peripheral Artery Disease.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	Arteries below and behind the knee have small diameters and may be diffusely diseased, calcified or both, limiting the effectiveness of traditional devices.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P46_S2	Behind-the-knee lesions also present challenges if a stent is required because stents frequently fracture due to the forces exerted on the vessels when the knee bends or flexes.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	The PAD Systems are effective in both diffused and calcified vessels.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P47_S1	This was demonstrated in the OASIS trial, where 94.5% of lesions treated with the Diamondback 360 were behind or below the knee.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	Arteries above the knee are longer, straighter and wider than below-the-knee vessels.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	Plaque in these arteries may also be diffuse, fibrotic and calcific.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	Our products are often used to treat lesions above the knee by using higher speeds or larger crown sizes.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	We have developed modified versions of the Stealth 360 and Diamondback 360 to treat coronary arteries.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	A coronary application requires us to conduct a clinical trial and file a premarket application, or PMA, and obtain approval from the FDA.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P51_S1	We participated in three pre-IDE meetings with the FDA and completed the human feasibility portion of a coronary trial in the summer of 2008 in India, enrolling 50 patients.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P51_S2	The FDA agreed to accept the data from the India trial to support an IDE submission.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P51_S3	The FDA granted unconditional approval in April 2010 to begin the ORBIT II coronary study in the United States.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P51_S4	In May 2011, we received approval from the FDA to complete enrollment of 429 patients in our ORBIT II clinical trial for a coronary application for the Diamondback 360 , which followed the FDA's review of data from the first 50 cases in the ORBIT II trial.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P51_S5	In July 2012 we received approval from the FDA to include the new electric coronary device (similar to Stealth 360 technology used in PAD and customized specifically for the coronary application), which improves ease of use.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P51_S6	The FDA required 100 enrollments with the new electric coronary device and would have allowed up to 50 additional patients in the trial, as needed, to achieve that enrollment level.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P51_S7	A total of 443 patients were enrolled in the trial.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P51_S8	The results of the study also demonstrated that 92.8% of patients were free from severe angiographic complications.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P51_S9	Post-atherectomy stents were successfully delivered in 97.7% of the patients with a low core lab assessed final procedure mean residual stenosis of 4.7%.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P51_S10	The ORBIT II study results met the primary safety and efficacy endpoints by significant margins with success rates of 89.6% and 88.9%, respectively, compared to primary endpoint targets of 83.0% and 82.0%, respectively.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P51_S11	Compared to previous studies of calcified lesions, the ORBIT II study results also showed that 92.8% of patients were free from angiographic complications and had significantly lower rates of major adverse cardiac event (MACE) and death.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	The PAD Systems represent an innovative approach to the treatment of PAD that provides physicians and patients with a procedure that addresses many of the limitations of traditional treatment alternatives.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	Each of the PAD Systems utilizes single-use catheters that incorporate a flexible drive shaft with an offset diamond grit coated crown.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	Physicians position the crown at the site of an arterial plaque-containing lesion and remove the plaque by positioning the crown to orbit against it, creating a smooth lumen, or channel, in the vessel.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	The PAD Systems are designed to differentiate between hard plaque and soft, compliant arterial tissue, a concept that we refer to as differential sanding.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	Normal arteries are compliant and have the ability to expand and contract as needed to supply blood flow.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P54_S1	Arteries burdened with fibrotic and/or calcified plaque due to PAD lose their compliance, which makes other therapies such as angioplasty, stenting, surgical bypass and other atherectomy technologies problematic.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	The PAD Systems sand plaque into small particles and restore both blood flow and vessel compliance.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	The particles created by the PAD Systems are generally smaller than red blood cells and are carried away by the bloodstream.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P55_S2	The small size of the particles avoids the need for plaque collection reservoirs.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	The PAD Systems can typically treat the diseased arteries with less than two minutes of sanding time, potentially reducing the overall procedure time.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	We believe the PAD Systems offer the following key benefits:
1180145_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	Differential Sanding Reduces Risk of Adverse Events.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	The PAD Systems are designed to differentiate between hard plaque and soft compliant arterial tissue.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	Arteries are composed of three tissue layers.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P60_S1	The diamond grit coated offset crown at the working end of the devices engages and removes plaque from the artery wall with minimal likelihood of penetrating or damaging the fragile, inner layer of the arterial wall because soft, compliant tissue flexes away from the crown.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P60_S2	Furthermore, the PAD Systems have rarely penetrated the middle or outer layers of the artery's wall.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P60_S3	The Diamondback 360 's perforation rate was 1.6% during our pivotal OASIS trial.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	Analysis by an independent pathology laboratory of more than 434 consecutive cross sections of porcine arteries treated with the Diamondback 360 revealed there was minimal to no damage, on average, to the middle layer, which is typically associated with restenosis.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P61_S1	In addition, the safety profile of the Diamondback 360 was found to be non-inferior to that of angioplasty, which is a common interventional method.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	The PAD Systems sand plaque away from artery walls in a manner that produces particles of such a small size - generally smaller than red blood cells - that they are carried away by the bloodstream.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P62_S1	The small size of the particles avoids the need for plaque collection reservoirs on the catheter and reduces the need for ancillary distal protection devices, commonly used with directional cutting atherectomy, and also significantly reduces the risk that larger pieces of removed plaque will block blood flow downstream.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	Allows Continuous Blood Flow During Procedure.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P63_S1	The PAD Systems allow for continuous blood flow during the procedure, except when initially used in chronic total occlusions.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P63_S2	Other devices may restrict blood flow due to the size of the catheter required or the use of distal protection devices, which could result in complications such as excessive heat and tissue damage.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	Efficacy Demonstrated in a 124-Patient Clinical Trial.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P65_S0	Our pivotal OASIS clinical trial was a prospective 20-center study that involved 124 patients with 201 lesions treated by the Diamondback 360 .
1180145_13_ITEM1_P65_S1	Performance targets were established cooperatively with the FDA before the trial began.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P65_S2	Despite 55% of the lesions consisting of calcified plaque, the Diamondback 360 in the OASIS trial successfully met the FDA's study endpoints.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P65_S3	Because the Predator 360 and Stealth 360 mechanism of action is identical to that of the Diamondback 360 , no additional efficacy trials were required by the FDA for 510(k) clearance of either PAD System.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P66_S0	Treats Difficult, Fibrotic and Calcified Lesions.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	The PAD Systems enable physicians to remove plaque from long, fibrotic, calcified or bifurcated lesions, as well as lesions with softer plaque, in peripheral arteries both above and below the knee.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P68_S0	The orbiting action of the PAD Systems removes the hard plaque in the artery by sanding.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P68_S1	As the crown sands away the plaque, the lumen of the artery is opened and the vessel wall becomes more compliant.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P68_S2	The orbital motion and speed of the crown increases, thus allowing for continuous removal of plaque as the opening of the lumen increases during the operation of the devices.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P69_S0	Non-orbiting rotational atherectomy catheters remove plaque by either abrading the lesion with a spinning, abrasive burr, or by shaving the lesion with sharp blades.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P69_S1	The burr-type device acts in a manner similar to a drill and only creates a lumen the same size or slightly smaller than the size of the burr.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P69_S2	They also generate heat that can traumatize the vessel.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P69_S3	The shaving devices are not able to discriminate between lesion disease and healthy vessel tissue and can generate large debris.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P70_S0	The differential sanding of the PAD Systems creates a smooth surface inside the lumen of a fibrotic or calcified lesion.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P70_S1	We believe that the smooth lumens created by the device increases the velocity of blood flow and decreases the resistance to blood flow, which may decrease the potential for restenosis, or renarrowing of the arteries.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	Physicians using the PAD Systems employ techniques similar to those used in angioplasty, which are familiar to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists who are trained in endovascular techniques.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P71_S1	The devices' simple user interfaces require minimal additional training.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	The orbital technology and differential sanding process of the PAD Systems allows for a single insertion to treat lesions, in most cases.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P72_S1	Because the particles of plaque sanded away are of such small sizes, the PAD Systems do not require a collection reservoir that needs to be repeatedly emptied or cleaned during the procedure, or add time and cost to the procedure.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P72_S2	Rather, the PAD Systems allow for multiple passes of the device over the lesion until plaque is removed and a smooth lumen is created.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	The PAD Systems have the ability to treat the entire leg, including small vessels below the knee and arterial-venus (AV) shunt.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	The PAD Systems have a short treatment time, typically less than two minutes.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	Single Crown Can Create Various Lumen Sizes Limiting Hospital Inventory Costs.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P76_S0	The orbital mechanism of action with the PAD Systems allows one device to create various diameter lumens inside the artery.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P76_S1	Adjusting the rotational speed of the crown changes the orbit to create the desired lumen diameter, thereby potentially avoiding the need to use multiple catheters of different sizes to treat multiple lesions.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	Since the physician does not need to insert and remove multiple catheters or clean a plaque collection reservoir to complete the procedure, there is a potential for decreased procedure time.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	Our goal is to be the leading provider of minimally invasive solutions for the treatment of vascular disease.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P78_S1	The key elements of our strategy include:
1180145_13_ITEM1_P79_S0	Drive Adoption through Our Direct Sales Organization and Key Opinion Leaders.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P79_S1	We expect to continue to drive adoption of the PAD Systems through our direct sales force, which targets interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, and interventional radiologists.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P79_S2	As a key element of our strategy, we focus on educating and training physicians on the PAD Systems through our direct sales force and through seminars where physician industry leaders discuss case studies and treatment techniques using the devices.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	Collect Additional Clinical Evidence on Benefits of the PAD Systems.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P80_S1	Physicians are increasingly requesting clinical study evidence to allow them to make the best treatment decisions to achieve the best possible short-term and long-term outcomes for their patients.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P80_S2	We are focused on collecting and using clinical evidence to demonstrate the advantages of the PAD Systems and drive physician acceptance.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P81_S0	Enhance PAD Systems and Expand Product Portfolio within the Market for Treatment of Peripheral Arteries.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P82_S0	In addition to enhancing the PAD Systems, we have expanded our product portfolio.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P82_S1	We offer multiple accessory devices designed to complement the use of the PAD Systems.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P82_S2	We continue to market the following products:
1180145_13_ITEM1_P83_S0	ViperTrack Radiopaque Tape - a radiopaque tape to assist in measuring lesion lengths and marking lesion locations We are continuing to evaluate internal product development to further expand our portfolio of PAD treatment solutions.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P84_S0	Leveraging our core technology into the coronary market.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P84_S1	We are leveraging our orbital technology to expand into the interventional coronary market.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P84_S2	A coronary application would address a large market opportunity, further leveraging our core technology and expanding its market potential.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P85_S0	In 2008, we completed the ORBIT I trial, a 50-patient study in India that investigated the safety of the Diamondback 360 device in treating calcified coronary artery lesions.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P85_S1	Results successfully met both safety and efficacy endpoints.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P85_S2	An IDE application was approved by the FDA for ORBIT II, and a pivotal trial that enrolled 443 patients in the United States was completed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the PAD Systems in treating severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P85_S3	The ORBIT II study results met the primary safety and efficacy endpoints by significant margins with success of 89.6% and 88.9%, respectively, compared to primary endpoint targets of 83.0% and 82.0%, respectively.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P85_S4	The ORBIT II study also showed significantly lower rates of MACE and death.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P86_S0	With the anticipated coronary approval, we are evaluating a variety of options for international expansion to maximize the coronary and peripheral market opportunities.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P86_S1	The options include a clinical approach in some countries and a commercial approach in others.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P86_S2	Sales channels will also be based on specific country dynamics.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P86_S3	As a result, distributors - including potential strategic partners - and direct sales channels are being evaluated.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P87_S0	In August 2009, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Asahi to market two peripheral guidewire lines in the United States.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P87_S1	In August 2011, we signed an amendment to expand the agreement to include three additional peripheral guidewires.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P87_S2	The product portfolio now includes the Treasure Floppy and Regalia and three specialty wires: Astato 20, Astato 30, and Treasure 12.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P87_S3	In June 2013, we signed an amendment to extend the exclusive guidewire agreement two more years.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P88_S0	In addition to adding to our product portfolio through internal development efforts, we intend to continue to explore the acquisition of other product lines, technologies or companies that may leverage our sales force or complement our strategic objectives.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P88_S1	We plan to continue to evaluate distribution agreements, licensing transactions, and other strategic partnerships.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P89_S0	We are committed to providing relevant clinical evidence that enables physicians to select and utilize the best treatment options for their patients.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P89_S1	We have conducted 12 clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the PAD Systems in treating PAD.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P89_S2	A total of 3,703 patients were enrolled in our PAD I and PAD II pilot studies, OASIS pivotal study, CONFIRM DIAMONDBACK, CONFIRM PREDATOR, CONFIRM OUTFLOW Post-Market Registries and the CALCIUM 360 and COMPLIANCE 360 post-market, randomized feasibility studies.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P89_S3	The results of these studies consistently demonstrated that the PAD systems provide predictable, repeatable and durable results that differentiate themselves from other PAD treatments.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P90_S0	Driven by our ongoing commitment to clinical research, we have initiated three new peripheral clinical studies in 2013, TRUTH, CLARITY, and LIBERTY 360.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P91_S0	Coronary artery disease (CAD), the most common form of heart disease, continues to grow significantly worldwide.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P92_S0	Performing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on calcified lesions can lead to MACE rates as high as 24% at 30 days, stent malapposition, and a number of procedural complications.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P92_S1	Despite being a relatively common problem, there have been no FDA IDE PMA trials studying only patients with severe coronary calcification.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P93_S0	The ORBIT I coronary clinical study was completed in India in 2009 to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of orbital atherectomy for use in calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P93_S1	Working closely with the FDA, the ORBIT II study was designed as a single arm trial since there were no other approved devices indicated to treat severely calcified coronary vessels.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P93_S2	In 2010, we began the ORBIT II pivotal study in the United States, evaluating the use of the Diamondback 360 in treating coronary arteries.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P93_S3	The ORBIT II study is the first study in the United States designed specifically for difficult-to-treat calcified coronary artery disease.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P94_S0	Compliance change as defined in the COMPLIANCE 360 protocol is to achieve 30% residual stenosis with orbital atherectomy followed by a low-pressure balloon inflation of 4 atmospheres pressure (atm).
1180145_13_ITEM1_P95_S0	Absolute plaque reduction is the difference between the pre-treatment percent stenosis, or the narrowing of the vessel, and the post-treatment percent stenosis as measured angiographically.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P96_S0	The target lesion revascularization (TLR) rate is the percentage of patients who have another peripheral intervention in the same lesion due to repeat or worsening symptoms.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P97_S0	Treatments such as angioplasty, stenting, surgery or atherectomy may be used to reopen the previously treated lesion site.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P98_S0	The Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) is a useful measurement in evaluating the adequacy of circulation in the legs and the improvement or worsening of leg circulation over time.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P98_S1	The ABI is a ratio between the blood pressure in a patient's ankle and arm; a ratio above 0.9 is normal.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P99_S0	SAEs include any event that is fatal or life-threatening, permanently disabling, that requires or prolongs hospitalization, or intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P99_S1	SAEs may or may not be related to the device.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P100_S0	Perforation occurs when the artery is punctured during treatment.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P100_S1	Perforations may be non-serious or serious adverse events (SAEs) depending on the treatment required to repair the perforation.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P101_S0	TLR is any repeat revascularization procedure of the original target lesion site due to worsening symptoms.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P101_S1	This includes angioplasty, stenting, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and atherectomy.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P102_S0	MACE includes death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P102_S1	MACE may or may not be related to the device.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P103_S0	Perforation occurs when the artery is punctured during treatment.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P103_S1	Perforations may be non-serious or serious adverse events (SAEs) depending on the treatment required to repair the perforation.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P104_S0	PAD I, our first clinical study, was a two-site, 17-patient feasibility clinical study in Europe initiated in March 2005.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P104_S1	Patients enrolled in the study had lesions less than 10 cm in length in arteries between 2.0 mm and 5.0 mm in diameter, with Rutherford Class scores of IV or lower.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P104_S2	Patients were evaluated at the time of the procedure and at 30 days following treatment.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P104_S3	The purpose of PAD I was to obtain the first human clinical experience and evaluate the safety of the Diamondback 360 , which was determined by estimating the cumulative incidence of patients experiencing one or more SAEs within 30 days post-treatment.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P105_S0	The results of PAD I confirmed that the Diamondback 360 System was safe and established that the Diamondback 360 could be used to treat vessels in the range of 2.0 mm and 5.0 mm diameter found primarily below the knee.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P105_S1	PAD I also showed that removal of plaque could be accomplished with a resulting device-to-lumen ratio of approximately 1.0 to 2.0.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P105_S2	The SAE rate in PAD I was 6% (one of 17 patients).
1180145_13_ITEM1_P106_S0	After being granted the CE Mark in May 2005, we initiated PAD II, a 66-patient European clinical study at seven sites, in August 2005.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P106_S1	All patients had stenosis in vessels below the femoral artery of between 1.5 mm and 4.0 mm in diameter, with at least 50% blockage.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P107_S0	The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the acute (30 days or less) risk of experiencing an SAE post-procedure and provide evidence of device effectiveness.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P107_S1	Effectiveness was confirmed angiographically and based on the percentage of absolute plaque reduction.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P108_S0	The PAD II results demonstrated safe and effective debulking in vessels with diameters ranging from 1.5 mm to 4.0 mm with a mean absolute plaque reduction of 55%.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P108_S1	The SAE rate in PAD II was 9% (six of 66 patients), which did not differ significantly from existing non-invasive treatment options.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P109_S0	An IDE was approved in September 2005 to begin OASIS, our pivotal United States study.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P109_S1	OASIS was a 124-patient, 20-center, prospective study that began enrollment in January 2006.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P109_S2	Patients included in the study had an ABI of less than 0.9, a Rutherford Class score of class V or lower and treated arteries of between 1.5 mm and 4.0 mm or less in diameter via angiogram measurement, with a well-defined lesion of at least 50% diameter stenosis and lesions of no greater than 10.0 cm in length.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P110_S0	The primary efficacy study endpoint was absolute plaque reduction of the target lesions from baseline to immediately post-procedure.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P110_S1	The primary safety endpoint was the cumulative incidence of SAEs at 30 days.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P111_S0	In the OASIS study, 94.5% of lesions treated were behind or below the knee, an area where lesions have traditionally gone untreated until they require bypass surgery or amputation.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P111_S1	Of the lesions treated in OASIS, 55% were comprised of calcified plaque, which presents a challenge to proper expansion and apposition of balloons and stents, and 48% were diffuse, or greater than 3 cm in length, which typically requires multiple balloon expansions or stent placements.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P111_S2	Competing plaque removal devices are often ineffective with these difficult-to-treat lesions.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P112_S0	The average time of treatment in the OASIS study was three minutes per lesion, which compares favorably to the treatment time required by other plaque removal devices.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P112_S1	The following table is a summary of the OASIS study results:
1180145_13_ITEM1_P113_S0	In August 2007, the FDA granted us 510(k) clearance for the use of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy System as a therapy in patients with PAD.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P114_S0	We conducted the CLEAR 360 study to evaluate the incidence of clinically significant hemolysis associated with orbital atherectomy used to treat severe peripheral arterial disease.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P114_S1	Enrolling 31 patients at four U.S. medical centers and completed in 2009, this study concluded that there was no clinically significant hemolysis after orbital atherectomy.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P115_S0	In May 2010, enrollment was completed in the COMPLIANCE 360 clinical study.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P115_S1	This post-market prospective, randomized, multi-center study evaluated the clinical and economic benefits of modifying plaque to change large vessel compliance above the knee with the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 .
1180145_13_ITEM1_P115_S2	The study compared the performance of the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 , plus low-pressure balloon angioplasty, if desired, with that of high-pressure balloon inflation alone.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P116_S0	Fifty patients were enrolled at nine U.S. medical centers with six and 12-month follow-up periods.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P116_S1	The study proved that, compared to balloon angioplasty alone, the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 plus low pressure balloon angioplasty leads to better luminal gain by improving lesion compliance and decreases the need for adjunctive stenting for the treatment of calcified femoral popliteal disease.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P116_S2	Restenosis and TLR were similar at 12 months despite the large disparity of stent usage between the two groups.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P116_S3	The results of this study demonstrated that the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 can achieve results in calcified plaque by improving lesion compliance through differential sanding, without the need for stent placement.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P116_S4	Results from the COMPLIANCE Study were presented at American College of Cardiology (ACC) in Chicago, Illinois in March 2012.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P117_S0	In April 2010, enrollment was completed in the CALCIUM 360 o study, a prospective, randomized, multi-center study comparing the effectiveness of the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy Systems to balloon angioplasty in treating calcified lesions below the knee.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P118_S0	Calcified plaque exists in about 80 percent of lesions below the knee, which makes them difficult to treat and can lead to increased complications.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P119_S0	Fifty patients were enrolled at eight U.S. medical centers.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P119_S1	This study demonstrated procedural success of 93.1% (27 out of 29 lesions) for the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 plus balloon angioplasty and 82.4% (28 out of 34 lesions) for balloon angioplasty alone.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P119_S2	At one year follow-up there were no amputations in either group.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P119_S3	Freedom from target vessel revascularization and death was seen in 93.3% and 100% in the Diamondback 360 and Predator 360 device groups, respectively, and 80.0% and 68.4% of the balloon angioplasty group, respectively.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P119_S4	Six and 12-month results showed that the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 treatment outperformed balloon angioplasty.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P119_S5	A key finding was that by modifying calcified lesions first, the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 allowed use of a lower-pressure adjunctive balloon therapy, reducing the need for bail-out stenting with improved longer-term patient outcomes.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P119_S6	Results of the CALCIUM 360 o study were published in the Journal of Endovascular Therapy in August 2012.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P120_S0	The CONFIRM Post-Market Clinical Registry Series were designed to further evaluate acute parameters related to the use of the PAD Systems.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P120_S1	The CONFIRM Series consisted of three registries: CONFIRM I DIAMONDBACK, CONFIRM II PREDATOR, and CONFIRM III OUTFLOW.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P121_S0	Enrollment of 733 patients in the CONFIRM I DIAMONDBACK Post-Market Registry was completed in March 2010.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P121_S1	In this prospective registry, 1,146 lesions were treated by 84 investigators at 57 medical centers with the Diamondback 360 .
1180145_13_ITEM1_P121_S2	Lesions treated were above the knee (46.5%), behind the knee (17.5%), and below the knee (36.0%).
1180145_13_ITEM1_P121_S3	Long and calcified lesions were treated with the Diamondback 360 followed by low pressure balloon angioplasty, if desired.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P121_S4	Bailout stenting, or stenting required due to tears in the vessel wall, occurred in 4.6% of lesions.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P121_S5	This is lower than the 35% to 40% bail-out stent rate reported in the literature for patients treated with high-pressure balloon angioplasty alone in this type of challenging patient population.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P121_S6	Results of this study were presented at the Complex Cardiovascular Catheter Therapeutic, or C3, conference in Orlando, Florida in June 2012.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P122_S0	Enrollment of 1,127 patients by 153 investigators at 122 institutions in the prospective CONFIRM II PREDATOR Post-Market Registry was completed in December 2010.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P122_S1	Data on acute clinical performance were collected during this study.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P122_S2	In this prospective registry, the average patient age was 70.7 years; 61.5% were male and 90% had lesions with mild to severe calcium.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P122_S3	The average lesion length was 72 mm.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P122_S4	The Predator 360 was used followed by balloon angioplasty (mean 5.44 atms) in 86% of lesions.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P122_S5	Average stenosis was 87.8% pre-procedure, 33.9% post-orbital and 9.6% post-adjunctive treatment.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P122_S6	The CONFIRM II PREDATOR study validates the use of this iteration of orbital technology in restoring flow by changing lesion compliance, thus allowing low-pressure balloon angioplasty with limited complications and reduced need for bail-out stenting.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P122_S7	These results were presented at the San Francisco Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics ( TCT) conference in November 2011.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P123_S0	Data from the CONFIRM DIAMONDBACK and PREDATOR registries were used to design the CONFIRM III OUTFLOW Post-Market Registry.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P123_S1	This was the third study in the CONFIRM series to further evaluate acute procedural outcomes associated with use of the Diamondback 360 .
1180145_13_ITEM1_P124_S0	Enrollment of 1,275 patients in the CONFIRM III OUTFLOW Post-Market Registry was completed in June 2011.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P124_S1	In this prospective registry 59% were male with an average patient age of 72.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P124_S2	Of the lesions treated, 42% were above the knee, 16% were behind the knee, 41% were below the knee, and 2% were unknown.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P124_S3	The average lesion length was 69.6 mm.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P124_S4	Lesions were treated with the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 followed by low pressure balloon angioplasty, if desired.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P124_S5	Pre-procedure stenosis was 87% and the average residual stenosis of 10% was achieved following orbital and adjunctive treatment.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P124_S6	The dissection rate was 9.9%, bail-out stenting occurred in 6.0% of lesions, and there was a low perforation rate of 0.7%.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P124_S7	The CONFIRM III OUTFLOW Registry provides additional evidence of the consistent results obtained using the Diamondback 360 or Predator 360 to treat difficult peripheral arterial disease.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P125_S0	The combined CONFIRM Series of 3,135 patients represents the largest PAD registry ever collected.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P125_S1	The CONFIRM Series presented at the Vascular Intervention Advancements (VIVA) Conference in Las Vegas in October 2012 concluded that vessel preparation through compliance change with orbital atherectomy enables lower-pressure adjunctive balloon angioplasty leading to low procedural events while preserving future treatment options.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P125_S2	The CONFIRM Series was published online in Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions in June 2013.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P126_S0	CSI continues to invest in clinical research through three peripheral studies currently underway.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P126_S1	The LIBERTY 360, TRUTH and CLARITY clinical studies will investigate the Diamondback 360 's acute and long term clinical outcomes, patient quality of life, comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P127_S0	The ORBIT I feasibility study evaluated performance of the Diamondback 360 for the treatment of de novo calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P127_S1	The ORBIT I study completed in India in 2009 enrolled 50 patients.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P127_S2	The endpoints were measured by device performance, MACE rate, and TLR at six months.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P127_S3	The observed MACE rate at 30 days and at 6 months was 6% and 8% respectively.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P127_S4	The 30-day and 6-month TLR was 2%.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P127_S5	A single center follow-up of 33 patients demonstrated a MACE rate of 18.2% at three year follow up as presented at Cardiovascular Research Technologies (CRT) in Washington DC in April 2013.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P128_S0	The ORBIT I study demonstrates that the Diamondback system can be used to modify de novo calcified coronary lesions and facilitated stent delivery in this difficult-to-treat plaque morphology.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P128_S1	Results from the ORBIT I study were published in Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions in June 2013.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P129_S0	To commercialize the Diamondback 360 in the United States for use in the coronary arteries, we are required to conduct further clinical studies to evaluate the safety and effectiveness in treating calcified coronary lesions and obtain a PMA from the FDA.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P130_S0	With FDA approval of the IDE in May 2010, the ORBIT II pivotal clinical study was initiated.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P130_S1	Enrollment of 443 patients was completed in November 2012 and the PMA application was submitted to the FDA in March 2013.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P130_S2	The average age of patients enrolled in the study was 71.4 years and 64.6% were male.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P130_S3	The results of the study demonstrated that 92.8% of patients were free from severe angiographic complications.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P130_S4	Post atherectomy stents were successfully delivered in 97.7% of the patients with a low core lab assessed final procedure mean residual stenosis of 4.7%.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P130_S5	Most importantly, the ORBIT II study met the primary safety and efficacy endpoints by significant margins with success of 89.6% and 88.9%, respectively, compared to primary endpoint targets of 83.0% and 82.0%, respectively.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P130_S6	The ORBIT II study also showed significantly lower rates of MACE and death.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P130_S7	Results from the study were presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) in San Francisco in March 2013.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P131_S0	The MACE study is a multi-center, prospective study to evaluate Major Adverse Coronary Events (MACE) along with target lesion revascularization and perforations in the treatment of moderate to severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P131_S1	This registry will include commercially available devices for revascularization involving stent deployment in de novo coronary lesions.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P131_S2	The data from this registry will demonstrate the rate of calcification in the real-world setting as well as examine health care resource utilization.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P132_S0	Sales and Marketing We market and sell our products through a direct sales force in the United States.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P133_S0	Revenues for the PAD Systems for fiscal 2013 , fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 were $91.2 million , $73.0 million and $69.3 million , respectively.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P134_S0	We have targeted sales and marketing efforts to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists with experience using similar catheter-based procedures, such as angioplasty, stenting, and cutting or laser atherectomy.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P134_S1	Physician referral programs and peer-to-peer education are other key elements of our sales strategy.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P135_S0	Patient referrals come from general practitioners, podiatrists, nephrologists and endocrinologists.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P135_S1	We target our marketing efforts to practitioners through physician education, medical conferences, seminars, peer-reviewed journals and marketing materials.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P135_S2	Our sales and marketing program focuses on:
1180145_13_ITEM1_P136_S0	We are not marketing our products internationally; however, we continue to evaluate international opportunities.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P136_S1	We executed a Purchasing Agreement with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, L.P., or HPG, that became effective on July 15, 2011.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P136_S2	HPG acts as a group purchasing organization for the healthcare providers belonging to HPG as participants.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P136_S3	Under the Purchasing Agreement, all of HPG s participants located in the United States or its territories are eligible to purchase the PAD Systems and related products at prices set forth in the Purchasing Agreement.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P136_S4	HPG has agreed not to contract with more than one alternative supplier from which participants may purchase products comparable to ours under the agreement.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P136_S5	During the term of the agreement, we have agreed to not solicit any HPG participant to enter into a separate agreement for our products.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P137_S0	Research and Development Our research and development efforts are focused in the development of products to penetrate our three key target markets: below and behind-the-knee, above-the-knee and coronary vessels.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P137_S1	Research and development projects include the development of new products, enhancement of existing products, and PAD and coronary clinical trials.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P137_S2	Research and development expenses for fiscal 2013 , fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 were $15.2 million , $11.4 million and $8.9 million , respectively.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P138_S0	We use internally-manufactured and externally-sourced components to manufacture the PAD Systems.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P138_S1	Most of the externally-sourced components are available from multiple suppliers; however, certain key components, including the diamond grit coated crown, and our ViperSlide Lubricant are single sourced.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P138_S2	We have strategies and arrangements in place for procuring our key components from alternative suppliers in the event that one or more of our single source suppliers were to discontinue supplying us with a key component.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P138_S3	We assemble the shaft, crown and handle components on-site, and test, pack, seal and label the finished assembly before sending the packaged product to a contract sterilization facility.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P138_S4	Upon return from the sterilizer, the product is held in inventory prior to shipping to our customers.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P139_S0	Our manufacturing facility in Minnesota, including the shaft manufacturing and the controlled-environment assembly areas, is equipped to accommodate approximately 30,000 devices per shift annually.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P139_S1	It also has storage capacity for approximately 8,000 devices and 100 Stealth 360 saline infusion pumps.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P140_S0	Our Pearland, Texas facility is 46,000 square feet and includes a custom-built clean room and production space for future expansion of value-add processes, including machining and electronics assembly.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P140_S1	The facility, when it becomes fully staffed and equipped, will have the capacity to produce approximately 75,000 devices per shift annually.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P140_S2	This facility has finished goods storage capacity for greater than 15,000 PAD Systems devices and other accessory products and over 500 Stealth 360 saline infusion pumps.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P141_S0	We are registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P141_S1	We have opted to maintain quality assurance and quality management certifications to enable us to market our products in the member states of the European Union, the European Free Trade Association and countries that have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements with the European Union.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P141_S2	We are ISO 13485:2003 certified, and our renewal is due by December 2015.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P141_S3	Under these registrations, our plants are audited by FDA and our Notified Body for the EU CE mark.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P142_S0	Third-party payors, including private insurers, and government insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, pay for a significant portion of patient care provided in the United States.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P142_S1	The single largest payor in the United States is the Medicare program, a federal governmental health insurance program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P142_S2	Medicare covers certain medical care expenses for eligible elderly and disabled individuals, including a large percentage of the population with PAD who could be treated with the PAD Systems.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P142_S3	In addition, private insurers often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P142_S4	Consequently, Medicare's coverage and reimbursement policies are important to our operations.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P143_S0	CMS has established Medicare reimbursement codes describing atherectomy products and procedures using atherectomy products.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P143_S1	We believe that physicians and hospitals that treat PAD with the PAD Systems will generally be eligible to receive reimbursement from Medicare and private insurers for the cost of the single-use catheter and the physician's services.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P144_S0	The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P144_S1	The PAD Systems compete with a variety of other products or devices for the treatment of vascular disease, including stents, balloon angioplasty catheters and atherectomy catheters, as well as products used in vascular surgery.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P144_S2	Large competitors in the stent and balloon angioplasty market segments include Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific, Cook Medical, Johnson Johnson and Medtronic.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P144_S3	We also compete against manufacturers of atherectomy catheters including, among others, Covidien, Spectranetics, Boston Scientific and MEDRAD, a business of Bayer HealthCare, as well as other manufacturers that may enter the market due to the increasing demand for treatment of vascular disease.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P144_S4	Other competitors include pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs for the treatment of mild to moderate PAD and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral bypass procedures.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P144_S5	We are not aware of any competing catheter systems either currently on the market or in development that also use an orbital motion to create lumens larger than the catheter itself.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P145_S0	Because of the size of the peripheral opportunities, competitors and potential competitors have historically dedicated significant resources to aggressively promote their products.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P145_S1	We believe that the PAD Systems compete primarily on the basis of:
1180145_13_ITEM1_P146_S0	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and other intellectual property laws, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P146_S1	As of July 31, 2013, we held 32 issued U.S. patents and have 42 U.S. patent applications pending, as well as 118 issued or granted foreign patents and 133 foreign patent applications, each of which corresponds to aspects of our U.S. patents and applications.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P146_S2	Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2012 and 2032, and our most important patents, U.S. Patent No. 6,494,890 and two key design patents covering our eccentric abrasive crown technology are due to expire on June 1, 2019, February 16, 2024 and December 29, 2023, respectively.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P146_S3	In addition, we have many additional patents relating to our core technology currently pending in the USPTO which will extend our key covered subject matter and coverage dates significantly.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P146_S4	Our issued patents and patent applications relate primarily to the design and operation of interventional atherectomy devices, including the PAD Systems.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P146_S5	These patents and applications include claims covering key aspects of orbital atherectomy devices, including the design, manufacture and therapeutic use of certain atherectomy abrasive heads, drive shafts, control systems, handles and couplings.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P146_S6	As we continue to research and develop our atherectomy technology, we intend to file additional U.S. and foreign patent applications related to the design, manufacture and therapeutic uses of atherectomy devices.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P146_S7	In addition, we hold 14 registered U.S. trademarks, 14 registered marks in the Madrid Protocol, six registered marks in Europe, five registered marks in Canada, five registered marks in Mexico, and three registered marks in Hong Kong.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P146_S8	We hold 11 trademark applications pending in the U.S, 12 trademark applications pending in Canada, six trademark applications pending in Hong Kong, and 16 trademark applications pending in India.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P147_S0	We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P147_S1	We seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P147_S2	Agreements with our employees also forbid them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P147_S3	We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P148_S0	Government Regulation of Medical Devices Governmental authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local levels and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of medical devices such as the PAD Systems.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P148_S1	Failure to obtain approval to market our products under development and to meet the ongoing requirements of these regulatory authorities could prevent us from marketing and continuing to market our products.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P149_S0	United States The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the FDA s implementing regulations govern medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P149_S1	Medical devices and their manufacturers are also subject to inspection by the FDA.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P149_S2	The FDCA, supplemented by other federal and state laws, also provides civil and criminal penalties for violations of its provisions.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P150_S0	We manufacture and market medical devices that are regulated by the FDA, comparable state agencies and regulatory bodies in other countries.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P150_S1	Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the United States will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P151_S0	The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization are premarket notification (also called 510(k) clearance) and premarket approval (also called PMA approval).
1180145_13_ITEM1_P152_S0	The type of marketing authorization applicable to a device 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is generally linked to classification of the device.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P153_S0	The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk FDA determines to be associated with a device and the extent of control deemed necessary to ensure the device s safety and effectiveness.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P153_S1	Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P153_S2	Class I devices are deemed to pose the least risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling, premarket notification, and adherence to the FDA s current good manufacturing practice requirements, as reflected in its Quality System Regulation, or QSR.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P153_S3	Class II devices are intermediate risk devices that are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or postmarket surveillance.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P153_S4	Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, and include life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, and devices not substantially equivalent to a device that is already legally marketed.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P154_S0	Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from FDA.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P154_S1	Class I and Class II devices that have not been so exempted are eligible for marketing through the 510(k) clearance pathway.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P154_S2	By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require PMA approval prior to commercial marketing.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P154_S3	The PMA approval process is generally more stringent, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) clearance process.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P154_S4	To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device legally marketed in the United States.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P154_S5	A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P154_S6	A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P155_S0	Generally, the 510(k) clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a year or more.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P156_S0	After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval (if the device as modified is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device).
1180145_13_ITEM1_P156_S1	The determination as to whether new authorization is needed is initially left to the manufacturer; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P156_S2	The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P156_S3	We received 510(k) clearance for use of the Diamondback 360 as a therapy in patients with PAD in the United States on August 22, 2007.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P156_S4	We received additional 510(k) clearances for the control unit used with the Diamondback 360 on October 25, 2007 and for the solid crown version of the Diamondback 360 on November 9, 2007.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P156_S5	We were granted 510(k) clearance of the Predator 360 in March 2009 and Stealth 360 in March 2011.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P157_S0	A PMA application requires the payment of significant user fees and must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P157_S1	A PMA application must also include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P158_S0	After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P158_S1	During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P158_S2	Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P158_S3	In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with the FDA s Quality System Regulations, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P159_S0	FDA review of a PMA application is required by statute to take no longer than 180 days, although the process typically takes significantly longer, and may require several years to complete.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P159_S1	The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
1180145_13_ITEM1_P160_S0	changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P161_S0	If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P161_S1	When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P161_S2	If the FDA s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P161_S3	The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P161_S4	Even if a PMA application is approved, the FDA may approve the device with an indication that is narrower or more limited than originally sought.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P161_S5	The agency can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of the device as a condition of approval, or impose post approval requirements such as continuing evaluation and periodic reporting on the safety, efficacy and reliability of the device for its intended use.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P162_S0	New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P162_S1	PMA approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P163_S0	We have completed the enrollment of patients in an FDA approved IDE trial to support a PMA to use the Diamondback 360 as a therapy in treating patients with calcified coronary artery disease.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P163_S1	The FDA granted unconditional approval in April 2010 to begin the ORBIT II coronary trial in the United States.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P163_S2	This pivotal trial was set up in two phases; Phase I allowed us to enroll up to 100 patients at as many as 50 U.S. sites, Phase II allowed us to expand the trial to the full complement of 429 patients.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P163_S3	In May 2011, we received approval from the FDA to complete enrollment of 429 patients in our ORBIT II clinical trial for a coronary application for the Diamondback 360 , which followed the FDA s review of data from the first 50 cases in the ORBIT II trial.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P163_S4	In July 2012, we received approval from the FDA to include the new electric coronary device (similar to Stealth 360 technology used in PAD and customized specifically for the coronary application), which improves ease of use.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P163_S5	The FDA required 100 enrollments with the new electric coronary device and would have allowed up to 50 additional patients in the trial, as needed, to achieve that enrollment level.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P163_S6	A total of 443 patients were enrolled in the trial.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P164_S0	Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P164_S1	These trials generally require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P164_S2	The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P164_S3	The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non- significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P164_S4	Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P164_S5	FDA approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P164_S6	With certain exceptions, changes made to an investigational plan after an IDE is approved must be submitted in an IDE supplement and approved by FDA (and by governing institutional review boards when appropriate) prior to implementation.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P165_S0	All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with regulations and requirements collectively known as good clinical practice.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P165_S1	Good clinical practices include the FDA s IDE regulations, which describe the conduct of clinical trials with medical devices, including the recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of sponsors and investigators, and labeling of investigation devices.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P165_S2	They also prohibit promotion, test marketing or commercialization of an investigational device and any representation that such a device is safe or effective for the purposes being investigated.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P165_S3	Good clinical practices also include the FDA s regulations for institutional review board approval and for protection of human subjects (such as informed consent), as well as disclosure of financial interests by clinical investigators.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P166_S0	Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P166_S1	The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P166_S2	The commencement or completion of any clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application or clearance of a premarket notification for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:
1180145_13_ITEM1_P167_S0	the FDA concludes that the trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P168_S0	After a device is approved and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P169_S0	product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device that may present a risk to health.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P170_S0	Since commercialization, we have had three minor instances of recall, involving a single lot of Diamondback 360 devices (8 units), two boxes of ViperWire products (10 wires), and 70 lots of Stealth 360 devices (145 units), related to Use By date labeling issues.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P170_S1	While these recalls were reported to the FDA, according to regulations, they did not present a risk to patient safety.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P170_S2	A separate recall, initiated in 2009 and completed in 2010, involved the ViperSheath, which is owned and manufactured by Thomas Medical Products.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P170_S3	As the distributor for the ViperSheath, we were required to recall all unused units from our customers and return them to Thomas Medical Products.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P170_S4	All of the unused ViperSheath products were captured and subsequently destroyed by Thomas Medical Products, with FDA observance.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P170_S5	We also completed a recall in 2012 involving six lots of Stealth 360 micro crown devices (45 units) due to the potential for an insufficient solder bond.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P170_S6	All unused devices were returned and no patient injuries resulted from this recall.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P170_S7	In addition, the FDA may require a company to conduct postmarket surveillance studies or order it to establish and maintain a system for tracking its products through the chain of distribution to the patient level.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P170_S8	Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions:
1180145_13_ITEM1_P171_S0	We and our contract manufacturers, specification developers and suppliers are also required to manufacture our products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, requirements set forth in the QSR.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P171_S1	The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing and record keeping.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P171_S2	The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P171_S3	If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers is not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to clear or approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P171_S4	Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P171_S5	Fraud and Abuse Our operations will be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the FDCA, federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P171_S6	These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P171_S7	In addition, these laws require us to screen individuals and other companies, suppliers and vendors in order to ensure that they are not debarred by the federal government and therefore prohibited from doing business in the healthcare industry.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P172_S0	The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P172_S1	Several courts have interpreted the statute s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P173_S0	The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P173_S1	Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P174_S0	The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P174_S1	Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P175_S0	In addition to the laws described above, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P176_S0	The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P176_S1	The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P177_S0	The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, was enacted by Congress in 2010 as part of the comprehensive health care reform legislation, and the implementing Open Payment regulations, released in February 2013, require persons to begin collecting certain data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals beginning in August 2013 for public reporting by the end of March 2014.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P177_S1	It is widely anticipated that public reporting under the Sunshine Act and implementing Open Payment regulations will result in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P178_S0	Voluntary industry codes, federal guidance documents and a variety of state laws address the tracking and reporting of marketing practices relative to gifts given and other expenditures made to doctors and other healthcare professionals.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P178_S1	In addition to impacting our marketing and educational programs, internal business processes will be affected by the numerous legal requirements and regulatory guidance at the state, federal and industry levels.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P179_S0	International Regulation International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P179_S1	The time required to obtain approval in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P179_S2	For example, the primary regulatory environment in Europe with respect to medical devices is that of the European Union, which includes most of the major countries in Europe.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P179_S3	Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P180_S0	The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P180_S1	Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the European Union, although actual implementation of these directives may vary on a country-by-country basis.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P181_S0	The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of submission of a design dossier, self-assessment by the manufacturer, a third-party assessment and, review of the design dossier by a Notified Body.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P181_S1	This third-party assessment generally consists of an audit of the manufacturer s quality system and manufacturing site, as well as review of the technical documentation used to support application of the CE Mark to one s product and possibly specific testing of the manufacturer s product.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P182_S0	An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the European Union is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P182_S1	We obtained CE marking approval for sale of the Diamondback 360 in May 2005.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P183_S0	Our operations are subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P183_S1	We are currently classified and licensed as a Very Small Quantity Hazardous Waste Generator within Ramsey County, Minnesota.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P183_S2	There are no regulated wastes requiring licensing in our Texas facility.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P184_S0	As of June 30, 2013 , we had 345 employees, including 79 employees in manufacturing, 174 employees in sales, 18 employees in marketing, 25 employees in clinical, 29 employees in general and administrative, and 20 employees in research and development, all of which are full-time employees.
1180145_13_ITEM1_P184_S1	None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We have a history of net losses and a short commercialization experience, and we are likely to continue to incur losses.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We are not profitable and have incurred net losses in each fiscal year since our formation in 1989.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	In particular, we had net losses of $24.0 million in fiscal 2013 , $16.8 million in fiscal 2012 , and $11.1 million in fiscal 2011 .
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	As of June 30, 2013 , we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $203.3 million .
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We commenced commercial sales of the Diamondback 360 in September 2007, and our short commercialization experience makes it difficult for us to predict future performance.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We also expect to incur significant additional expenses for sales and marketing, research and development and manufacturing as we continue to commercialize the PAD Systems and additional expenses as we seek to develop and commercialize future versions of the PAD Systems, a coronary application for our technology, and other products.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Additionally, we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as our business grows.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	As a result, our operating losses are likely to continue.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We may be unable to sustain our revenue growth.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our revenue has grown in each of the fiscal years since we commenced commercial sales of the Diamondback 360 in September 2007.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Our ability to continue to increase our revenues in future periods will depend on our ability to increase sales of the PAD Systems and new and improved products we introduce, including growing our customer base and reorders from those customers, and obtaining new applications for our technology.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	The extent of our future success will also depend on our ability to successfully obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize our technology for coronary applications.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	We may not be able to generate, sustain or increase revenues on a quarterly or annual basis.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P2_S5	If we cannot achieve or sustain revenue growth for an extended period, our financial results will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Economic conditions may adversely affect our business.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Adverse worldwide economic conditions may have adverse implications on our business.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	A significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of our customers could cause unfavorable trends in their purchases and also in our receivable collections and additional allowances may be required, which could adversely affect our operating results.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Adverse worldwide economic conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers' ability to provide us with materials and components, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P3_S4	The PAD Systems and future products may never achieve broad market acceptance.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P3_S5	The PAD Systems and future products we may develop may never gain broad market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P3_S6	The degree of market acceptance of any of our products will depend on a number of factors, including:
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	the level of education and awareness among physicians and hospitals concerning our products.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Failure of the PAD Systems to significantly penetrate current or new markets would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our customers may not be able to achieve adequate reimbursement for using the PAD Systems, which could affect the acceptance of our products and cause our business to suffer.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved medical devices and procedures is uncertain.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The commercial success of our products is substantially dependent on whether third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement for the use of such products and related services are available.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We expect the PAD Systems to continue to be purchased by hospitals and other providers who will then seek reimbursement from various public and private third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers, for the services provided to patients.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	While third-party payors are currently providing reimbursement for use of the PAD Systems, we can give no assurance that these third-party payors will continue to provide adequate reimbursement for use of the PAD Systems to permit hospitals and doctors to consider the products cost-effective for patients requiring PAD treatment, or that current reimbursement levels for the PAD Systems will continue.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P5_S4	In particular, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services has proposed reductions in reimbursement levels for office-based labs that, if implemented, could adversely affect our business.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P5_S5	In addition, the overall amount of reimbursement available for PAD treatment could decrease in the future.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain sufficient reimbursement could cause our business to suffer.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement, and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for use of the PAD Systems.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In order to position the PAD Systems for acceptance by third-party payors, we may have to agree to lower prices than we might otherwise charge.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Governmental and private sector payors have instituted initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs using, for example, price regulation or controls and competitive pricing programs.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Some third-party payors also require demonstrated superiority, on the basis of randomized clinical trials, or pre-approval of coverage, for new or innovative devices or procedures before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such devices or procedures.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	It is uncertain whether the PAD Systems or any future products we may develop will be viewed as sufficiently cost-effective to warrant adequate coverage and reimbursement levels.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	If third-party coverage and reimbursement for the PAD Systems is limited or not available, the acceptance of the PAD Systems and, consequently, our business will be substantially harmed.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Healthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	There have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control healthcare costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system, some of which have been enacted into law, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Patient Act.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The Patient Act imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers and these taxes will adversely affect our financial results.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The Patient Act and any additional healthcare proposals and laws that may be enacted in the future could also limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The Patient Act and future healthcare legislation could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Our financial performance may be adversely affected by medical device tax provisions in the health care reform legislation.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P9_S5	The imposition of the 2.3% medical device excise tax enacted as part of the Patient Act may require us to identify ways to reduce spending in other areas or raise additional capital to offset the expected increased expense.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P9_S6	We do not expect to be able to pass along the cost of the tax to our customers or to be able to offset the cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting from the expansion of health insurance coverage because of the demographics of the current uninsured population.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The level of difficulty in terms of complying with the medical device tax will depend on the regulations put forth by the U.S. Department of Treasury.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Ongoing implementation of this legislation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We have limited data and experience regarding the safety and efficacy of the PAD Systems.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Any long-term data that is generated may not be positive or consistent with our limited short-term data, which would affect market acceptance of these products.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Because our technology is relatively new in the treatment of PAD, we have performed clinical trials only with limited patient populations.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The long-term effects of using the PAD Systems in a large number of patients have not been studied and the results of short-term clinical use of the PAD Systems do not necessarily predict long-term clinical benefit or reveal long-term adverse effects.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Clinical trials conducted with the PAD Systems have involved procedures performed by physicians who are very technically proficient.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Consequently, both short and long-term results reported in these studies may be significantly more favorable than typical results achieved by physicians, which could negatively impact market acceptance of the PAD Systems.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We face significant competition, must innovate to stay competitive, and may be unable to sell the PAD Systems at profitable levels.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The market for medical devices is highly competitive, dynamic and marked by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovation.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our ability to compete depends on our ability to innovate successfully, and while certain barriers exist to entry into our market we cannot assure that new entrants or existing competitors will not be able to develop products that compete directly with our products.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We compete against very large and well-known stent and balloon angioplasty device manufacturers, atherectomy catheter manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral bypass procedures.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	We may have difficulty competing effectively with these competitors because of their well-established positions in the marketplace, significant financial and human capital resources, established reputations and worldwide distribution channels.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	develop more effective or less expensive products or technologies that render our technology or products obsolete or non-competitive.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We have encountered and expect to continue to encounter potential customers who, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to or prefer the products offered by these competitors.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If we are unable to compete successfully, our revenue will suffer.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Increased competition might lead to price reductions and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Competitive pressures may decrease the demand for our products and could adversely affect our financial results.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We have limited commercial manufacturing experience and could experience difficulty in producing the PAD Systems or may need to depend on third parties to manufacture the products.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We have limited experience in commercially manufacturing the PAD Systems and have no experience manufacturing these products in the volume that we anticipate will be required if we achieve planned levels of commercial sales.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	As a result, we may not be able to develop and implement efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to manufacture the PAD Systems or future products in significant volumes, while meeting the legal, regulatory, quality, price, durability, engineering, design and production standards required to market our products successfully.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	The forecasts of demand we use to determine order quantities and lead times for components purchased from outside suppliers may be incorrect.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Our failure to obtain required components or subassemblies when needed and at a reasonable cost would adversely affect our business.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S5	In addition, we may in the future need to depend upon third parties to manufacture the PAD Systems and future products.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Any difficulties in locating and hiring third-party manufacturers, or in the ability of third-party manufacturers to supply quantities of our products at the times and in the quantities we need, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S7	We depend upon third-party suppliers, including single source suppliers to us and our customers, making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S8	We rely on third-party suppliers to provide us with certain components of our products and to provide key components or supplies to our customers for use with our products.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S9	We rely on single source suppliers for certain components of the PAD Systems.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S10	We depend on our suppliers to provide us and our customers with materials in a timely manner that meet our and their quality, quantity and cost requirements.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S11	These suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand and our customers' demands.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S12	Any supply interruption from our suppliers or failure to obtain additional suppliers for any of the components used in our products would limit our ability to manufacture our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S13	We may need to increase the size of our organization and we may experience difficulties managing growth.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S14	If we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business, our future revenue and operating results may be adversely affected.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S15	The growth we may experience in the future may provide challenges to our organization, requiring us to rapidly expand our sales and marketing personnel and manufacturing operations.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S16	Rapid expansion in personnel may result in less experienced people producing and selling our products, which could result in unanticipated costs and disruptions to our operations.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S17	If we cannot scale and manage our business appropriately, our anticipated growth may be impaired and our financial results will suffer.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S18	We may require additional financing, and our failure to obtain additional financing when needed could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S19	We may be dependent on additional financing to execute our business plan.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S20	Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S21	In the event we need or desire additional financing, we may be unable to obtain it by borrowing money in the credit markets or raising money in the capital markets.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S22	If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, we may terminate or delay the development of one or more of our products, or delay establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S23	We face a risk of non-compliance with the financial covenants in our loan and security agreements with Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S24	We are party to loan and security agreements with Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S25	These agreements require us to maintain, among other things, a monthly specified liquidity ratio and contain customary events of default, including, among others, the failure to comply with certain covenants or other agreements.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S26	Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, amounts due under the agreements may be accelerated by Silicon Valley Bank or Partners for Growth.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If we are unable to meet the financial or other covenants under the current loan and security agreements or negotiate future waivers or amendments of such covenants, events of default could occur under the agreements.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the agreements, Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth have available a range of remedies customary in these circumstances, including declaring all outstanding debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to be due and payable, foreclosing on the assets securing the agreements and/or ceasing to provide additional loans, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The restrictive covenants under these agreements could limit our ability to obtain future financing, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The financial and restrictive covenants contained in the agreements could also adversely affect our ability to respond to changing economic and business conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies that may be subject to fewer restrictions.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Transactions that we may view as important opportunities, such as acquisitions, may be subject to the consent of Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth, which consents may be withheld or granted subject to conditions specified at the time that may affect the attractiveness or viability of the transaction.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We are dependent on our senior management team and highly skilled personnel, and our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain personnel necessary for our success.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We are highly dependent on our senior management.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Our success will depend on our ability to retain senior management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, including scientists, clinicians, engineers and other highly skilled personnel and to integrate current and additional personnel in all departments.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P17_S6	The loss of members of our senior management, scientists, clinical and regulatory specialists, engineers and sales personnel could prevent us from achieving our objectives of continuing to grow our company.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P17_S7	We do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Our stock price is volatile and subject to significant fluctuations.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P17_S9	The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P17_S10	Market prices for securities of early-stage pharmaceutical, medical device, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P17_S11	Our common stock traded as low as $8.60 and as high as $22.67 per share during the 12-month period ended June 30, 2013 .
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P17_S12	Factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Moreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by 5-percent shareholders that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may have experienced an ownership change in the past and we may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock, some of which may be outside our control.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards or other pre-change tax attributes to offset United States federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitations.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Our ability to market the PAD Systems in the United States is limited to use as a therapy in patients with PAD, and if we want to expand our marketing claims, we will need to file for additional FDA clearances or approvals and conduct further clinical trials, which would be expensive and time consuming and may not be successful.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	The PAD Systems received FDA 510(k) clearances in the United States for use as a therapy in patients with PAD.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S4	This general clearance restricts our ability to market or advertise the PAD Systems beyond this use and could affect our growth.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	If we determine to market our orbital technology in the United States for other uses, we would need to conduct further clinical trials and obtain premarket approval from the FDA.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	For example, we recently completed clinical trials for use of our devices in the coronary arteries.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Clinical trials are complex, expensive, time consuming, uncertain and subject to substantial and unanticipated delays.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain FDA approval to use our orbital atherectomy technology for the treatment of coronary artery disease or for applications other than the treatment of PAD.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S4	We are or will be subject to an extensive set of post-market controls that apply to us as we commercialize our products, including annual PMA reports, Medical Device Reports (MDRs) on serious adverse events, complaint handling and analysis under the FDA's Quality System Regulation, or QSR, export controls, advertising and promotion requirements, and potential post-market studies required by the FDA.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S5	We and our suppliers are also subject to regulation by various state authorities, which may inspect our or our suppliers' facilities and manufacturing processes and enforce state regulations.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Failure to comply with applicable state regulations may result in seizures, injunctions or other types of enforcement actions.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Our promotion of the PAD Systems is closely controlled by the FDA and enforcement activities could limit our ability to inform potential customers of the features of the products.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S8	We may not receive FDA approval to market our orbital atherectomy technology for use in coronary arteries or we may be significantly delayed in obtaining such approval or such approval may be subject to limitations or other requirements.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S9	We are required to file a PMA application with the FDA and obtain the FDA's approval before we are permitted to begin marketing our orbital atherectomy technology for use in treating coronary artery disease.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S10	We completed our PMA application on March 15, 2013.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S11	The FDA will review our PMA application to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our device in treating coronary artery disease.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S12	The FDA may conclude that our device does not meet appropriate standards of safety and effectiveness and may not grant the approval necessary to market our device for use in coronary arteries in the United States.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S13	Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain such FDA approval.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S14	The length of time required for the FDA's review will depend upon factors over which we have no control, including whether the FDA submits the review to a panel of independent experts in which case the review is likely to take longer than if the review is not submitted to a panel.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S15	We cannot predict when the FDA will complete its review, and even if approval is ultimately granted, such approval may be significantly delayed.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S16	Any delay in obtaining such FDA approval would delay the commercialization of our coronary application, which would adversely affect our business.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S17	If the FDA approves our orbital atherectomy product for treatment of coronary artery disease, we will be subject to all the postmarket requirements for PMA products, such as an annual report.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S18	Our manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S19	Even if FDA approval is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or effectiveness of the product.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S20	Later discovery of previously unknown problems with the use of orbital atherectomy in coronary arteries, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturer or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the product from the market, voluntary or mandatory recall, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S21	The PAD Systems may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation and product liability claims that could exceed the limits of available insurance coverage.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material regulatory deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	For example, since commercialization, we have had minor instances of recall involving a single lot of Diamondback 360 devices, two boxes of ViperWire products, and 70 lots of Stealth 360 devices, related to Use By date labeling issues; a recall of unused ViperSheath products, which we formerly distributed for Thomas Medical Products; and a recall involving six lots of Stealth 360 micro crown devices due to the potential for an insufficient solder bond.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Any recalls of our products or products that we distribute would divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation with customers and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Also, if the PAD Systems are defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contain defective components or are misused, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P22_S4	The use, misuse or off-label use of the PAD Systems may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P22_S5	We cannot prevent a physician from using the PAD Systems for off-label applications.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P22_S6	While we have product liability insurance coverage for our products and intend to maintain such insurance coverage in the future, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected from claims that are brought against us.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We are subject to many laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The PAD Systems and related manufacturing processes, clinical data, adverse events, recalls or corrections and promotional activities are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory bodies.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In particular, we are required to comply with the QSR and other regulations, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product for which we obtain marketing clearance or approval.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	We are also responsible for the quality of components received by our suppliers.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Failure to comply with the QSR requirements or other statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or failure to adequately respond to any observations, could result in, among other things:
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	If any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales to suffer.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our operations are also subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P24_S3	In addition, our relationships with physicians, hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny under various federal anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws, as further described below.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P24_S4	If our operations are found to be in violation of these laws, we, as well as our employees, may be subject to penalties, including monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration health programs, workers' compensation programs and TRICARE (the healthcare system administered by or on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense for uniformed services beneficiaries, including active duty and their dependents, retirees and their dependents), and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P24_S5	We are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting kickbacks and false and fraudulent claims which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Additionally, any challenges to or investigations into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, and similar state laws, prohibit payments that are intended to induce health care professionals or others either to refer patients or to purchase, lease, order or arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease or order of healthcare products or services.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	A number of states have enacted laws that require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report payments, gifts and other remuneration made to physicians and other health care professionals and health care organizations.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In addition, some state statutes, most notably laws in Massachusetts and Vermont, impose outright bans on certain gifts to physicians.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Some of these laws, referred to as aggregate spend or gift laws, carry substantial fines if they are violated.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, was enacted by Congress in 2010 as part of the comprehensive health care reform legislation, and the implementing Open Payments regulations under the Sunshine Act, released in February 2013, require us to begin collecting certain data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals beginning in August 2013 for public reporting by the end of March 2014.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	It is widely anticipated that public reporting under the Sunshine Act and implementing Open Payments regulations will result in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	These anti-kickback, public reporting and aggregate spend laws affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers or users of medical devices.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	They also impose additional administrative and compliance burdens on us.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	In particular, these laws influence, among other things, how we structure our sales offerings, including discount practices, customer support, education and training programs and physician consulting and other service arrangements.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P27_S4	If we were to offer or pay inappropriate inducements to purchase our products, we could be subject to a claim under the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute or similar state laws.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P27_S5	If we fail to comply with particular reporting requirements, we could be subject to penalties under applicable federal or state laws.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P27_S6	Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payments to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or for items or services that were not provided as claimed.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P27_S7	Although we do not submit claims directly to government healthcare programs or other payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims by providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, by providing improper financial inducements, or through certain other activities.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P27_S8	In providing billing and coding information to customers, we make every effort to ensure that the billing and coding information furnished is accurate and that treating physicians understand that they are responsible for all treatment decisions.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P27_S9	Nevertheless, we cannot provide assurance that the government will regard any billing errors that may be made as inadvertent or that the government will not examine our role in providing information to our customers and physicians concerning the benefits of therapy with our devices.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P27_S10	Likewise, our financial relationships with customers, physicians, or others in a position to influence the purchase or use of our products may be subject to government scrutiny or be alleged or found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	False claims laws prescribe civil, criminal and administrative penalties for noncompliance, which can be substantial.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Moreover, an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business and results of operations.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	New regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses, may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries, as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer's efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	These new requirements will require due diligence efforts for the 2013 calendar year, with initial disclosure requirements effective in May 2014.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	There will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P29_S3	In addition, the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could allow our competitors and others to produce products based on our technology, which could substantially impair our ability to compete.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Our success and ability to compete depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P29_S6	We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P29_S7	Our issued patents and related intellectual property may not be adequate to protect us or permit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P29_S8	Also, we cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P29_S9	Further, if any patents we obtain or license are deemed invalid and unenforceable, or have their scope narrowed, it could impact our ability to commercialize or license our technology and achieve competitive advantages.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, if at all.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We may, in the future, need to assert claims of infringement against third parties to protect our intellectual property.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P30_S3	The outcome of litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in patents, copyrights, trade secrets or trademarks is highly unpredictable, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, reputation and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Despite our efforts to safeguard our unpatented and unregistered intellectual property rights, we may not be successful in doing so or the steps taken by us in this regard may not be adequate to detect or deter misappropriation of our technology or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our products, technology or other information that we regard as proprietary.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to litigate, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Additionally, third parties may be able to design around our patents.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P31_S3	We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P31_S4	In this regard, we seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by having a policy that our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P31_S5	We cannot provide any assurance that employees and third parties will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements, or that we will be effective in securing necessary assignments from these third parties.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others could prohibit us from commercializing products, require us to obtain licenses from third parties or require us to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages and injunctive relief.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The medical technology industry is characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The likelihood that patent infringement or misappropriation claims may be brought against us increases as we achieve more visibility in the marketplace and introduce products to market.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We are aware of numerous patents issued to third parties that relate to the manufacture and use of medical devices for the treatment of vascular disease.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The owners of each of these patents could assert that the manufacture, use or sale of our products infringes one or more claims of their patents.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	There could also be existing patents of which we are unaware that one or more aspects of our technology may inadvertently infringe.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P34_S3	In some cases, litigation may be threatened or brought by a patent-holding company or other adverse patent owner who has no relevant product revenues and against whom our patents may provide little or no deterrence.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Any infringement or misappropriation claim could cause us to incur significant costs, place significant strain on our financial resources, divert management's attention from our business and harm our reputation.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P34_S5	If the relevant patents were upheld in litigation as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe, we could be prohibited from commercializing any infringing products unless we could obtain licenses to use the technology covered by the patent or are able to design around the patent.
1180145_13_ITEM1A_P34_S6	We may be unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may not be able to redesign any infringing products to avoid infringement.
1180145_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	In September 2009, we entered into an agreement to lease a 46,000 square foot production facility in Pearland, Texas beginning on April 1, 2010.

1180145_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are a medical device company focused on developing and commercializing interventional treatment systems for vascular disease.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our primary products, the Stealth 360 PAD System (the Stealth 360 ), the Diamondback 360 PAD System (the Diamondback 360 ), and the Diamondback Predator 360 PAD System (the Predator 360 ) are catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of plaque types in leg arteries both above and below the knee and address many of the limitations associated with existing treatment alternatives.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	We also are pursuing approval of our products for coronary use.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P0_S3	We refer to the Stealth 360 , Diamondback 360 , and the Predator 360 collectively in this report as the PAD Systems.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	We were incorporated as Replidyne, Inc. in Delaware in 2000.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	On February 25, 2009, Replidyne, Inc. completed its business combination with Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., a Minnesota corporation ( CSI-MN ), in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of November 3, 2008 (the Merger Agreement ).
1180145_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, CSI-MN continued after the merger as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Replidyne.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P1_S3	Replidyne changed its name to Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. ( CSI ) and CSI-MN merged with and into CSI, with CSI continuing after the merger as the surviving corporation.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P1_S4	These transactions are referred to herein as the merger.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Replidyne was a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, in-licensing and commercializing anti-infective products.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	CSI was incorporated in Minnesota in 1989.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	From 1989 to 1997, we engaged in research and development on several different product concepts that were later abandoned.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	Since 1997, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development of the PAD Systems and since 2007, to obtaining approval for a coronary application of our orbital technology.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P2_S4	From 2003 to 2005, we conducted numerous bench and animal tests in preparation for application submissions to the FDA.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P2_S5	We initially focused our testing on providing a solution for coronary in-stent restenosis, but later changed the focus to peripheral artery disease, or PAD.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P2_S6	In 2006, we obtained an investigational device exemption from the FDA to conduct our pivotal OASIS clinical trial, which was completed in January 2007.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P2_S7	The OASIS clinical trial was a prospective 20-center study that involved 124 patients with 201 lesions.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P2_S8	In August 2007, the FDA granted us 510(k) clearance for the use of the Diamondback 360 as a therapy in patients with PAD.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P2_S9	We commenced commercial introduction of the Diamondback 360 in the United States in September 2007.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P2_S10	We were granted 510(k) clearance of the Predator 360 in March 2009 and Stealth 360 in March 2011.

1180145_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	We have developed modified versions of the Stealth 360 and Diamondback 360 to treat coronary arteries.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	A coronary application requires us to conduct a clinical trial and file a premarket application, or PMA, and obtain approval from the FDA.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	On March 15, 2013, we completed submission of our PMA application to the FDA for our orbital atherectomy system to treat calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	As of June 30, 2013 , we had an accumulated deficit of $203.3 million .
1180145_13_ITEM7_P4_S3	We expect our losses to continue as we invest in sales, marketing, medical education, clinical studies and product research and development for our next phase of growth in the peripheral market and preparation for a potential coronary application.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P4_S4	To date, we have financed our operations primarily from the issuance of common and preferred stock, convertible promissory notes, and debt.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	We derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of PAD Systems and other ancillary products.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	The PAD Systems each use a disposable, single-use, low-profile catheter that travels over our proprietary ViperWire guidewire.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	The electric powered Stealth 360 PAD System uses a saline infusion pump as a power supply for the operation of the catheter, while the air powered Diamondback 360 and Predator 360 PAD Systems use an external control unit that powers the system.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	Our ancillary products include the ViperSlide Lubricant and ViperTrack Radiopaque Tape.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	We also have an exclusive distribution agreement with Asahi to market its peripheral guide wire line in the United States.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P6_S4	We assemble the single-use catheter with components purchased from third-party suppliers, as well as with components manufactured in-house.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P6_S5	The infusion pump and guidewires are purchased from third-party suppliers.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	Selling, general and administrative expenses include compensation for executive, sales, marketing, finance, information technology, human resources and administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation.

1180145_13_ITEM7_P8_S3	All research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Approved patent applications are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Interest and other income (expense) primarily includes interest expense (including premium and discount amortization), interest income, change in the fair value of the debt conversion option, debt refinancing costs, and net write-offs upon debt conversion (option and unamortized premium or discount).

1180145_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Interest income is attributed to interest earned on deposits in investments that consist of money market funds.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Change in Fair Value of Debt Conversion Option.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	Change in fair value of debt conversion option represents the period to period change in fair value of the debt conversion option associated with outstanding convertible debt.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Net Write-offs Upon Debt Conversion (Option and Unamortized Premium or Discount).
1180145_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	Net write-offs upon debt conversion (option and unamortized premium) are the result of the conversion of convertible debt, and include the write-off of the related debt conversion option and any unamortized debt premium or discount.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	Other consists of miscellaneous non-operating expenses, including state taxes.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	We have established valuation allowances to fully offset our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty about our ability to generate the future taxable income necessary to realize these deferred assets, particularly in light of our historical losses.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	The future use of net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on us attaining profitable operations and will be limited in any one year under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 due to significant ownership changes (as defined in Section 382) resulting from our equity financings.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	At June 30, 2013 , we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax reporting purposes of approximatel y $150.4 million , which will expire at various dates through fiscal 2033.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect amounts reported in those statements.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	Our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, excess and obsolete inventory, the debt conversion option, and stock-based compensation are updated as appropriate at least quarterly.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	We use authoritative pronouncements, our technical accounting knowledge, cumulative business experience, valuation specialists, judgment and other factors in the selection and application of our accounting policies.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P17_S4	While we believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments that we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements are appropriate, these estimates, assumptions and judgments are subject to factors and uncertainties regarding their outcome.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P17_S5	Therefore, actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Some of our significant accounting policies require us to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	We sell the majority of our products via direct shipment to hospitals or office-based labs.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	We record estimated sales returns, discounts and rebates as a reduction of net sales in the same period revenue is recognized.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	Costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P19_S4	Cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P19_S5	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P19_S6	This allowance is an estimate and is regularly evaluated for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience, credit quality of the customer base, age of the receivable balances, both individually and in the aggregate, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P19_S7	Provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts attributed to bad debt are recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	We have inventories that are principally comprised of capitalized direct labor and manufacturing overhead, raw materials and components, and finished goods.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	Due to the technological nature of our products, there is a risk of obsolescence to changes in our technology and the market, which is impacted by technological developments and events.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	Accordingly, we write down our inventories as we become aware of any situation where the carrying amount exceeds the estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future demands and market conditions.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P20_S3	The evaluation includes analyses of inventory levels, expected product lives, product at risk of expiration, sales levels by product and projections of future sales demand.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	The fair value of the debt conversion option is related to the loan and security agreement with Partners for Growth and has been included as a component of debt conversion option and other assets on our balance sheet.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	The Monte Carlo option pricing model used to determine the value of the debt conversion option includes various inputs including historical volatility, stock price simulations, and the assessed behavior of us and Partners for Growth based on those simulations.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	We recognize stock-based compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments computed at the date of grant.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	The fair value of all restricted stock awards and units are expensed in the consolidated statements of operations over the related vesting period.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	All restricted stock awards and units we have granted become exercisable over periods established at the date of grant.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P22_S3	The fair value of each restricted stock award and unit was equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant, as determined by management and the board of directors.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	In accordance with FASB guidance, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements related to legal proceedings when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	If a loss is possible, but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands), and, for certain line items, the changes between the specified periods expressed as percent increases or decreases:
1180145_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Comparison of Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2013 with Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2012 Revenues.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	Revenues increased by $21.4 million , or 26.0% , from $82.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2012 to $103.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2013 .
1180145_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	This increase was primarily attributable to an $18.2 million , or 25.0% , increase in the number of PAD Systems sold and a $3.2 million , or 33.6% , increase in sales of supplemental and other revenue during the year ended June 30, 2013 , compared to the year ended June 30, 2012 .
1180145_13_ITEM7_P25_S3	Currently, all of our revenues are in the United States; however, we may potentially sell internationally in the future.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P25_S4	We expect our revenue to increase as we continue to increase the number of physicians using the devices and the usage per physician as we continue to focus on physician education programs, introduce new and improved products, and generate clinical data.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P25_S5	Cost of goods sold increased by $5.2 million , or 26.9% , from $19.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2012 , to $24.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2013 .
1180145_13_ITEM7_P25_S6	These amounts represent the cost of materials, labor and overhead for single-use catheters, guidewires, control units, pumps, and other supplemental products.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P25_S7	The decrease in gross margin from 76.7% during the year ended June 30, 2012 , to 76.5% for the year ended June 30, 2013 , was primarily due to a higher mix of Stealth 360 sales, which carries a higher unit cost than its predecessor product, and to lower average selling prices, partially offset by the favorable effect of increased production volumes.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P25_S8	Cost of goods sold for the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 includes $427,000 and $296,000 , respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P25_S9	We expect that gross margin in fiscal 2014 will improve slightly compared to fiscal 2013 as cost improvements will be made throughout the year.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Quarterly fluctuations could occur based on production volumes, timing of new product introductions, sales mix, pricing changes, or other unanticipated circumstances.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses .
1180145_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	Selling, general, and administrative expense increased by $20.4 million , or 30.7% , from $66.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2012 , to $86.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2013 .
1180145_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2013 have increased due to increased variable compensation, expansion in our sales and marketing organizations, increased medical education programs, and the medical device excise tax, which became effective January 1, 2013 and resulted in an expense of $987,000 for the year ended June 30, 2013 .
1180145_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 includes $6.2 million and $4.4 million , respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P27_S4	We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as a result of the costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing organization and programs to further commercialize our PAD products and prepare for a potential future coronary application.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P27_S5	Research and development expenses increased by $3.8 million , or 33.8% , from $11.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2012 , to $15.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2013 .
1180145_13_ITEM7_P27_S6	Research and development expenses relate to the development of new products, enhancement of existing products and PAD and coronary clinical trials.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P27_S7	The increase in clinical expenses related to advancement of the ORBIT II coronary trial and related expansion of the clinical organization.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P27_S8	Research and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 include $798,000 and $474,000 , respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P27_S9	As we continue to expand our product portfolio within the market for the treatment of peripheral arteries and leverage our core technology into the coronary market, we generally expect to incur research and development expenses significantly above amounts incurred for the year ended June 30, 2013 .
1180145_13_ITEM7_P27_S10	Fluctuations could occur based on the number of projects and studies and the timing of expenditures.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Interest and other income (expense) was $(1.6) million and $(2.3) million for the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	Significant changes in interest and other expense during these periods included:
1180145_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Change in Fair Value of Debt Conversion Option.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	The change in fair value of the debt conversion option was $(554,000) for the year ended June 30, 2012 and $370,000 for the year ended June 30, 2013 .
1180145_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	The debt conversion option is associated with our outstanding convertible debt and changes in its fair value are primarily driven by the change in the market value of our common stock.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Net Write-offs Upon Conversion (Option and Unamortized Premium or Discount).
1180145_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	Net write-offs upon conversion were $(182,000) during the year ended June 30, 2012 and $(551,000) during the year ended June 30, 2013 .
1180145_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	Net write-offs upon conversion are the result of the conversion of convertible debt and include the write-off of the debt conversion option and any unamortized debt premium or discount.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P30_S3	Net loss for the year ended June 30, 2013 was $24.0 million , compared to $16.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2012 .
1180145_13_ITEM7_P30_S4	Our net loss has increased as a result of increased operating expenses, partially offset by higher gross profit.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Comparison of Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2012 with Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2011 Revenues.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	Revenues increased by $3.7 million, or 4.7%, from $78.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2011 to $82.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2012.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	This increase was primarily attributable to a $3.7 million, or 5.4%, increase in average selling prices of PAD Systems during the year ended June 30, 2012, compared to the year ended June 30, 2011.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P31_S3	Cost of goods sold increased by $2.9 million, or 18.1%, from $16.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2011 to $19.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2012.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P31_S4	These amounts represent the cost of materials, labor and overhead for single-use catheters, guidewires, control units, pumps, and other supplemental products.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P31_S5	The decrease in gross margin from 79.3% during the year ended June 30, 2011 to 76.7% for the year ended June 30, 2012 was primarily due to a higher mix of Stealth 360 sales, which currently carry higher unit costs than its predecessor products due to limited initial component purchasing volumes, and to reserves for inventory transitions.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P31_S6	Also, the addition of our second manufacturing facility in Texas for future production capacity temporarily increased production costs, but we believe will enhance efficiencies over time.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P31_S7	Cost of goods sold for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 includes $296,000 and $312,000, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P31_S8	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses .
1180145_13_ITEM7_P31_S9	Selling, general, and administrative expense increased by $4.0 million, or 6.4%, from $62.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2011 to $66.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2012.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P31_S10	Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2012 have increased due to the expansion of our marketing organization, increased variable compensation, and increased medical education programs, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P31_S11	Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 include $4.4 million and $5.6 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Research and development expenses increased by $2.4 million, or 27.2%, from $8.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2011, to $11.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2012.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	Research and development expenses relate to specific projects to improve our product or expand into new markets, such as the development of an electric version of the PAD Systems, shaft designs, crown designs, and PAD and coronary clinical trials.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	The increase in clinical expenses related to advancement of the ORBIT II coronary trial, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P32_S3	Research and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 include $474,000 and $587,000, respectively, for stock-based compensation.

1180145_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Interest expense was $(1.4) million for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	Interest expense results from outstanding debt balances and debt premium and discount amortization.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Change in Fair Value of Debt Conversion Option.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	The change in fair value of the debt conversion option was $491,000 for the year ended June 30, 2011 and $(554,000) for the year ended June 30, 2012.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	The debt conversion option is associated with our outstanding convertible debt and changes in its fair value are primarily driven by the change in the market value of our common stock.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	Net Write-offs Upon Conversion (Option and Unamortized Premium or Discount).
1180145_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	Net write-offs upon conversion were $(1.4) million during the year ended June 30, 2011 and $(182,000) during the year ended June 30, 2012.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Net write-offs upon conversion are the result of the conversion of convertible debt and include the write-off of the conversion option and any unamortized debt premium or discount.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	Net loss for the year ended June 30, 2012 was $16.8 million, compared to $11.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2011.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	Our net loss has increased as a result of increased operating expenses, partially offset by higher gross profit.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION To supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, our management uses a non-GAAP financial measure referred to as Adjusted EBITDA.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands):
1180145_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA of $5.6 million, or 66.1%, is primarily the result of the $8.0 million, or 55.0%, increase in the loss from operations.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	The loss from operations was significantly impacted by increases in operating expenses.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	Adjusted EBITDA was also impacted by an increase in stock-based compensation and increase in depreciation and amortization.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P38_S3	Stock-based compensation increased $2.3 million, or 44.1%, from $5.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2012 to $7.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2013 .
1180145_13_ITEM7_P38_S4	Stock-based compensation increased as a result of vesting of previously granted share awards with a higher grant date fair value, and the granting of performance based restricted stock awards with shorter vesting periods than service based awards.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P38_S5	Depreciation and amortization increased as a result of additional investment in capital equipment and patents.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P38_S6	We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of performance and believe this measure facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by factoring out potential differences caused by depreciation and amortization expense and non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P38_S7	Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA to analyze the underlying trends in our business, assess the performance of our core operations, establish operational goals and forecasts that are used to allocate resources and evaluate our performance period over period and in relation to our competitors operating results.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P38_S8	We believe that presenting Adjusted EBITDA provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P38_S9	We also believe that providing this information better enables our investors to understand our operating performance and evaluate the methodology used by our management to evaluate and measure such performance.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P38_S10	Adjusted EBITDA is also used to measure performance in our financial covenants as required by Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P38_S11	The following is an explanation of each of the items that management excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and the reasons for excluding each of these individual items:
1180145_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP financial measures primarily because such expense, while constituting an ongoing and recurring expense, is not an expense that requires cash settlement.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	Our management also believes that excluding this item from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand its impact on our operational performance, liquidity and ability to make additional investments in the Company, and it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	We exclude depreciation and amortization expense from our non-GAAP financial measures primarily because such expenses, while constituting ongoing and recurring expenses, are not expenses that require cash settlement and are not used by our management to assess the core profitability of our business operations.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	Our management also believes that excluding these items from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand our operational performance, liquidity and ability to make additional investments in the Company.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	Material Limitations Associated with the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Manner in which We Compensate for these Limitations Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	Some of the limitations associated with our use of these non-GAAP financial measures are:
1180145_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	Items such as stock-based compensation do not directly affect our cash flow position; however, such items reflect economic costs to us and are not reflected in our Adjusted EBITDA and therefore these non-GAAP measures do not reflect the full economic effect of these items.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore other companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Our management exercises judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures we use.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily upon our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	We had cash and cash equivalents of $67.9 million and $35.5 million at June 30, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P43_S3	During the year ended June 30, 2013 , net cash used in operations amounted to $10.8 million .
1180145_13_ITEM7_P43_S4	As of June 30, 2013 , we had an accumulated deficit of $203.3 million .
1180145_13_ITEM7_P43_S5	We have historically funded our operating losses primarily from the issuance of common and preferred stock, convertible promissory notes, debt, and the merger with Replidyne in February 2009.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank On March 29, 2010, we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	The agreement was amended on December 27, 2011 to increase outstanding borrowings, and subsequently amended on June 29, 2012 to modify financial covenants and reduce the interest rate and other fees, and on May 10, 2013 to modify financial covenants.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	The agreement, as amended, includes a $12.0 million term loan and a $15.0 million line of credit.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P44_S3	The terms of each of these loans are as follows:
1180145_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	The $12.0 million term loan has an initial interest rate of 8.0%, which can be reduced to 7.0% based on the achievement of positive EBITDA for the trailing six month period.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	The term loan has a 36 month maturity, with repayment terms that include interest only payments during the first six months, followed by 30 equal principal payments of $400,000 plus interest, and a final payment of $100,000 due at maturity.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	This term loan also includes an acceleration provision that requires us to pay the entire outstanding balance, plus a penalty ranging from 1.0% to 3.0% of the commitment amount, upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P45_S3	The balance outstanding on the term loan at June 30, 2013 , was $7.0 million net of the unamortized discount associated with warrants issued to Silicon Valley Bank in connection with the loan.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P45_S4	The unamortized discount associated with warrants and other fees paid to the lender are being amortized over the 36 month maturity period.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	The $15.0 million line of credit expires on June 30, 2014 and has a floating interest rate equal to the Wall Street Journal's prime rate, plus 1.25%, with an interest rate floor of 4.5%.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	Interest on borrowings is due monthly and the principal balance is due at maturity.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	Borrowings on the line of credit are based on 85% of eligible accounts.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P46_S3	Accounts receivable receipts are deposited into a lockbox account in the name of Silicon Valley Bank.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P46_S4	The line of credit is subject to non-use fees, annual fees, and cancellation fees.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P46_S5	There was not an outstanding balance on the line of credit at June 30, 2013 .
1180145_13_ITEM7_P46_S6	Borrowings from Silicon Valley Bank are secured by all of our assets.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P46_S7	The borrowings are subject to prepayment penalties and financial covenants, including maintaining certain liquidity and fixed charge coverage ratios.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P46_S8	We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of June 30, 2013 .
1180145_13_ITEM7_P46_S9	Any non-compliance by us under the terms of debt arrangements could result in an event of default under the Silicon Valley Bank loan, which, if not cured, could result in the acceleration of this debt.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	Loan and Security Agreement with Partners for Growth On April 14, 2010, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Partners for Growth III, L.P. (PFG), as amended on August 23, 2011, December 27, 2011, June 30, 2012 and May 10, 2013.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	The amended agreement provides that PFG will make loans to us up to $5.0 million.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	The agreement has a maturity date of April 14, 2015.

1180145_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	At any time prior to the maturity date, PFG may at its option convert any of the outstanding loans into shares of our common stock at the applicable conversion price, which in each case equaled the ten-day volume weighted average price per share of our common stock prior to the issuance date of each note.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	We may also effect at any time a mandatory conversion of amounts, subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations provided in the agreement, including a requirement that the ten-day volume weighted average price of our common stock prior to the date of conversion is at least 15% greater than the conversion price.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	We may reduce the conversion price to a price that represents a 15% discount to the ten-day volume weighted average price of our common stock to satisfy this condition and effect a mandatory conversion.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P49_S3	We recorded a benefit (expense) of $370,000 and $(554,000) for the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 related to the change in fair value of the debt conversion options on all outstanding loans.

1180145_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	Cash and cash equivalents was $67.9 million and $35.5 million at June 30, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	The increase is primarily attributable to net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended June 30, 2013 , partially offset by net cash used in operating and investing activities and payments of long term debt.

1180145_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	Our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including the extent and duration of future operating losses, the level and timing of future sales and expenditures, the results and scope of ongoing research and product development programs, working capital required to support our sales growth, the receipt of and time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals, our sales and marketing programs, the continuing acceptance of our products in the marketplace, competing technologies and market and regulatory developments.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	As of June 30, 2013 , we believe our current cash and cash equivalents and available debt will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and operations for greater than 12 months.

1180145_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Since inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance requiring that all non-owner changes in stockholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income, and the total of comprehensive income.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P65_S3	The new guidance became effective for us beginning July 1, 2012.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P65_S4	Other than requiring additional disclosures, there has not been a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption as we have no other comprehensive income.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	The amendments in ASU 2013-11 require us to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion thereof, as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss (NOL) carryforward or a similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward, unless the uncertain tax position is not available to reduce, or would not be used to reduce, the NOL or carryforward under the tax law in the same jurisdiction; otherwise, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a gross liability and should not net the unrecognized tax benefit with a deferred tax asset.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P66_S2	ASU 2013-11 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2013 and should be applied to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist as of the effective date.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P66_S3	Companies may choose to apply this guidance retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented.
1180145_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	We do not anticipate a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption .

1180145_13_ITEM8_P0_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

1180145_13_ITEM8_P0_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1180145_13_ITEM8_P0_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P0_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P0_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

1180145_13_ITEM8_P0_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P1_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

1180145_13_ITEM8_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1180145_13_ITEM8_P9_S1	Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	Customer credit terms are established prior to shipment with the general standard being net 30 days.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P10_S1	Collateral or any other security to support payment of these receivables generally is not required.

1180145_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	The establishment of inventory allowances for excess and obsolete inventories is based on estimated exposure on specific inventory items.

1180145_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	The recoverability of capitalized patent costs is dependent upon the Company s ability to derive revenue-producing products from such patents or the ultimate sale or licensing of such patent rights.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	Patents that are abandoned are written off at the time of abandonment.

1180145_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P17_S1	The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated by the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value.

1180145_13_ITEM8_P18_S1	One lease contains rent escalation clauses for which the lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

1180145_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P20_S1	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P20_S2	Developing a provision for income taxes, including the effective tax rate and the analysis of potential tax exposure items, if any, requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws, regulations and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P20_S3	The Company s judgment and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	Accounting guidance requires that accounting for uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in the financial statements.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P21_S1	The guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P21_S2	Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P21_S3	The guidance also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing, enhancement and regulatory approval of the Company s products.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P22_S1	Research and development expenses include employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, supplies and materials, consulting expenses, patent amortization, travel and facilities overhead.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P22_S2	The Company also incurs significant expenses to operate clinical trials, including trial design, third-party fees, clinical site reimbursement, data management and travel expenses.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P22_S3	Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	Approved patent applications are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P23_S1	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years .
1180145_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P24_S1	The Company maintains its cash balances primarily with one financial institution.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P24_S2	These balances exceed federally insured limits.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P24_S3	The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in cash and cash equivalents.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments Under the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P25_S1	The authoritative guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P26_S1	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	The categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	The following table sets forth the fair value of the Company s financial instruments that were measured on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2013 .
1180145_13_ITEM8_P28_S1	Assets are measured on a recurring basis if they are remeasured at least annually:
1180145_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	The fair value of the debt conversion option is related to the loan and security agreement with Partners for Growth (described in Note 3) and has been included as a component of debt conversion option and other assets on the balance sheet.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P29_S1	The Monte Carlo option pricing model used to determine the value of the debt conversion option included various inputs including expected volatility, stock price simulations, and assessed behavior of the Company and Partners for Growth based on those simulations.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P29_S2	Based upon these inputs, the Company considers the conversion option to be a Level 3 investment.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P29_S3	Significant changes in any of these inputs in isolation would result in a significant change in the fair value measurement.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P29_S4	The following assumptions were utilized in determining the fair value at June 30, 2013 :
1180145_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	As of June 30, 2013 , the Company believes that the carrying amounts of its other financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P30_S1	The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value based on interest rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	The preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P31_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments computed at the date of grant.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	The fair value of all stock option and restricted stock awards are expensed in the consolidated statements of operations ratably over the related vesting period.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance requiring that all non-owner changes in stockholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P33_S1	In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income, and the total of comprehensive income.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P33_S2	The new guidance became effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2012.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P33_S3	Other than requiring additional disclosures, there have not been material impacts on the Company's consolidated financial statements upon adoption as the Company has no other comprehensive income.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P34_S1	The amendments in ASU 2013-11 require companies to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion thereof, as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss (NOL) carryforward or a similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward, unless the uncertain tax position is not available to reduce, or would not be used to reduce, the NOL or carryforward under the tax law in the same jurisdiction; otherwise, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a gross liability and should not net the unrecognized tax benefit with a deferred tax asset.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P34_S2	ASU 2013-11 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2013 and should be applied to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist as of the effective date.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P34_S3	Companies may choose to apply this guidance retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	T he Company does not anticipate a material impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	As of June 30, 2013 , future estimated amortization of patents and patent licenses will be:
1180145_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	This future amortization expense is an estimate.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P37_S1	Actual amounts may vary from these estimated amounts due to additional intangible asset acquisitions, approval of patents-in-process, potential impairment, accelerated amortization or other events.

1180145_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	______________________________ (a) Excludes the effect of shares granted, exercised, forfeited or expired related to activity from shares granted outside the stock option plans described above.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	The Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP).
1180145_13_ITEM8_P78_S1	The plan provides eligible employees the opportunity to acquire common stock in accordance with Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P78_S2	Stock can be purchased each six -month period per year (twice per year).
1180145_13_ITEM8_P78_S3	The purchase price is equal to 85% of the lower of the price at the beginning or the end of the respective period.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	The ESPP allows for an annual increase in reserved shares on each July 1 equal to the lesser of (i) one percent of the common shares outstanding, or (ii) 180,000 shares, provided that the Board of Directors may designate a smaller amount of shares to be reserved.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P79_S1	On July 1, 2013, 180,000 shares were added to the plan.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P79_S2	Employees purchased 180,000 shares at an average price of $9.75 per share during the year ended June 30, 2013 .
1180145_13_ITEM8_P79_S3	Shares reserved under the plan for the year ending June 30, 2014 totaled 180,709 .
1180145_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	The components of the Company s overall deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1180145_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	The Company has established valuation allowances to fully offset its deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty about the Company s ability to generate the future taxable income necessary to realize these deferred assets, particularly in light of the Company s historical losses.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P81_S1	The future use of net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on the Company attaining profitable operations, and may be limited in any one year under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 due to significant ownership changes, as defined under such Section, as a result of the Company s equity financings.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	A summary of the valuation allowances are as follows:
1180145_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	As of June 30, 2013 and 2012, the Company had federal tax NOL carryforwards of approximately $150,381 and $128,273 , respectively.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P83_S1	These NOL carryforwards are available to offset taxable income through 2033 and begin to expire in 2018.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P83_S2	The Company also had various state NOL carryforwards available to offset future state taxable income.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P83_S3	These state NOL carryforwards typically have the same expirations as the Company s federal tax NOL carryforwards.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P83_S4	As of June 30, 2013 and 2012, the Company had approximately $3,171 and $3,065 of federal research and development credit carryforwards, respectively.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P83_S5	As of June 30, 2013 and 2012, the Company had approximately $749 of state research and development credit carryforwards.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P83_S6	The federal and state research and development credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2024.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	As required by FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, the Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P84_S1	For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P84_S2	The Company recorded a liability relating to unrecognized tax benefits of $392 and $381 at June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P84_S3	Due to the Company having a full valuation allowance, this liability has been netted against the deferred tax asset.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P84_S4	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax provisions as part of the provision for income taxes.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P84_S5	The Company has not currently reserved for any interest or penalties for such reserves due to the Company being in an NOL position.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P84_S6	The Company does not expect to recognize any benefits from the unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P84_S7	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
1180145_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P85_S1	Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply.

1180145_13_ITEM8_P87_S0	Amounts payable under the Company s Texas production facility lease are included in the amounts above.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P87_S1	A portion of those rent payments may reduce the deferred grant incentive liability rather than being recorded as expense.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P87_S2	See Note 11 for additional information.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P88_S0	Employee Benefits The Company offers a 401(k) plan to its employees.

1180145_13_ITEM8_P90_S3	The PEDC will provide the Company with an additional $850 of net cash incentive funds in the following amounts and upon achievement of the following milestones:
1180145_13_ITEM8_P90_S4	In order to retain all of the cash incentives, the Company must maintain no fewer than 25 jobs at the Texas facility through June 30, 2015.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P90_S5	Failure to meet this requirement will result in an obligation to make reimbursement payments to the PEDC as outlined in the amended agreement.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P90_S6	The Company will not have any reimbursement requirements after June 30, 2015.

1180145_13_ITEM8_P91_S0	The Company has presented the net cash incentive funds as a current and long-term liability on the balance sheet.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P91_S1	The liabilities are reduced through the term of the agreement and recorded as an offset to expenditures incurred using a systematic methodology.
1180145_13_ITEM8_P91_S2	As of June 30, 2013 , the deferred grant incentive liabilities have been reduced by $3,525 in cumulative expenses, resulting in a remaining current liability of $156 and long-term liability of $83 .

1180145_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	We are a medical technology company leading the way in the effort to successfully treat patients suffering from peripheral and coronary artery diseases, including those with arterial calcium, the most difficult disease to treat.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our employees devote every day to developing and commercializing innovative solutions that help physicians save limbs and lives when facing this difficult disease state.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P5_S2	We are committed to clinical rigor, constant innovation and a defining drive to set the industry standard to deliver safe and effective medical devices that improve lives.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	We have developed a patented orbital atherectomy technology for peripheral and coronary commercial applications.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our peripheral arterial disease systems are catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of plaque types in leg arteries both above and below the knee and address many of the limitations associated with other treatment alternatives.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") granted us 510(k) clearance for the following PAD Systems as a therapy in patients with peripheral artery disease ("PAD"):
1180145_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	As of June 30, 2014, over 155,000 of our PAD Systems have been sold to leading institutions across the United States.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	Sales of PAD Systems during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 represented 84% of revenue.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our coronary product, the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS ("CAD System"), is a catheter-based platform designed to facilitate stent delivery in patients with coronary artery disease ("CAD") who are acceptable candidates for PTCA or stenting due to de novo , severely calcified coronary artery lesions.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	The CAD System design is similar to technology used in our PAD Systems, customized specifically for the coronary application.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	In October 2013, we received PMA approval from the FDA to market the CAD System as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P9_S3	We commenced a commercial launch that same month and as of June 30, 2014, nearly 1,400 patients across the United States have benefited from the use of our coronary technology.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P9_S4	Sales of CAD Systems during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 represented approximately 4% of revenue.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	In addition to the PAD and CAD Systems, we intend to expand our product portfolio through internal product development and establishment of business relationships with other medical device companies.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	We offer multiple accessory products designed to complement the use of the PAD and CAD Systems, and we have an exclusive distribution agreement with Asahi-Intecc Co., Ltd. to market its peripheral guidewire line in the United States.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	Sales of complementary products, primarily guidewire sales, represented 12% of revenue during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	Peripheral artery disease ("PAD") is a circulatory problem in which plaque deposits build up on the walls of the arteries, which can result in inadequate blood flow to the limbs.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	Arteries above the knee are generally long, straight and relatively wide compared to arteries below the knee, which tend to be shorter and branch into arteries that are progressively smaller in diameter.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	The most common early symptoms of PAD are pain, cramping or fatigue in the leg or hip muscles while walking.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	Symptoms may progress to include numbness, tingling or weakness in the leg and, in severe cases, burning or aching pain in the leg, foot or toes while resting.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P13_S2	As PAD progresses, additional signs and symptoms occur, including cooling or color changes in the skin of the legs or feet, and wounds or sores on the legs or feet that will not heal.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	If left untreated, PAD may continue to progress and lead to Critical Limb Ischemia ("CLI"), a condition in which the amount of oxygenated blood being delivered to the limb is insufficient to keep the tissue alive.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	CLI may lead to large non-healing ulcers, infections, gangrene, limb amputation or death.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P14_S2	Untreated CLI eventually results in an estimated 160,000 amputations per year.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	A study by Dr. Miguel Montero-Baker et al. concluded that a traditional antegrade recanalization attempt can fail in up to 20% of the cases (Montero-Baker et al.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	"Retrograde Approach for Complex Popliteal and Tibioperoneal Occlusions," J Endovasc Therapy, 2008).
1180145_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	There are two primary references used for estimating PAD prevalence: the patient Ankle Brachial Index ("ABI") or diabetes rates.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	The most recent comprehensive study, based on ABI, estimates the U.S. prevalence at 8.5 million (Allison et al, Ethnic-Specific Prevalence of Peripheral Arterial Disease in the United States, Circulation, 2007).
1180145_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	Alternatively, a study by The SAGE Group, based on the diabetes method, estimates prevalence at 17.6 million in 2010 (The SAGE Group, "The Diabetes Method," 2011).
1180145_14_ITEM1_P17_S3	An aging population, coupled with increasing incidence of diabetes and obesity, is likely to continue to increase the prevalence of PAD.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	In many older PAD patients, particularly those with diabetes, PAD is characterized by fibrotic (moderately hard) or calcified (extremely hard) plaque deposits that can be very challenging to treat.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	Although we believe the rate of PAD diagnoses is increasing, it is believed that under-diagnosis continues, due to patients failing to display symptoms or physicians misinterpreting symptoms as normal aging.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Emphasis on PAD education from industry, medical associations, insurance companies and other groups, coupled with publications in medical journals and public news channels, is increasing physician and patient awareness of PAD risk factors, symptoms, and treatment options.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	In a Dr. Gary Mintz et al. angiography study, 1,155 native vessel target lesions in 1,117 patients were studied by intravascular ultrasound ("IVUS") and coronary angiography.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	The presences, magnitude, location, and distribution of IVUS calcium were analyzed and compared with the detection and classification (none/mild, moderate, and severe) by angiography.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	lesions (38%): 306 (26%) moderate calcium and 134 (12%) severe calcium.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	The distribution of these lesions are classified as above the knee ("ATK"), at the knee or below the knee ("BTK").
1180145_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	According to our CONFIRM Post-Market Clinical Registry Series, which were designed to further evaluate acute parameters related to the use of the PAD Systems, 46% of the disease is ATK, 16% behind the knee and 36% BTK.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P22_S3	As a result of additional clinical trial outcomes, new 2011 guidelines from the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association lowered the recommended age for testing for PAD from 70 to 65, or 50 if the patient has a history of smoking or diabetes.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P22_S4	As these guidelines are incorporated into physician practice, PAD diagnosis rates are forecasted to increase.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	Physicians manage a significant portion of the PAD diagnosed population by recommending lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, and by prescribing prescription drugs.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	While medications, diet and exercise may improve blood flow, they do not treat the underlying obstruction and many patients have difficulty maintaining lifestyle changes.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	As a result of these challenges, many medically managed patients develop more severe symptoms that require procedural intervention.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	Coronary artery disease ("CAD") is a life-threatening condition and leading cause of death in men and women in the United States.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	CAD occurs when a fatty material called plaque builds up on the walls of arteries that supply blood to the heart.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P24_S2	The plaque buildup causes the arteries to harden and narrow (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	The risk of CAD increases if a person has one or more of the following: high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, or family history of early heart disease.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	According to the American Heart Association, 16.3 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with CAD, the most common form of heart disease.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	Heart disease claims more than 600,000 lives in the United States each year.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	According to estimates, significant arterial calcium is present in nearly 40% of patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention ("PCI").
1180145_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	Significant calcium contributes to poor outcomes and higher treatment costs in coronary interventions when traditional therapies are used, including a significantly higher occurrence of death and major adverse cardiac events ("MACE").
1180145_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our OAS represents an innovative approach to the treatment of PAD and CAD that provides physicians and patients with a procedure that addresses many of the limitations of traditional treatment alternatives.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	Each of the OAS utilize single-use catheters that incorporate a flexible drive shaft with an offset diamond grit coated crown.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	Physicians position the crown at the site of an arterial plaque-containing lesion and remove the plaque by positioning the crown to orbit against it, creating a smooth lumen, or channel, in the vessel.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	The OAS are designed to differentiate between hard plaque and soft, compliant arterial tissue, a concept that we refer to as differential sanding.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	The diamond grit coated crown preferentially engages and sands the harder material, but is designed not to damage more compliant parts of the artery.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P30_S3	The Peripheral OAS also treats soft plaque, which is still harder than a normal vessel wall.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our OAS uses a single-use, low-profile catheter that travels over our proprietary guidewires and is powered by a saline infusion.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	The PAD System reduces plaque on peripheral vessel walls by using a rotating, diamond-coated crown within peripheral arteries.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	Similarly, the CAD System uses the same method to reduce severely calcified plaque on coronary vessel walls within coronary arteries in order to facilitate stent delivery.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	The catheter for our OAS consists of:
1180145_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	a sheath, which covers the drive shaft and permits delivery of saline or medications to the treatment area.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	ViperWire Advance Guidewire and ViperWire Advance Coronary Guidewire.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	The ViperWire guidewires were designed to offer an improved ability to maneuver through tortuous, twisting blood vessels and cross challenging lesions.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	The OAS travels over this wire to the lesion and operate on this wire.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	ViperSlide is an exclusive lubricant designed to optimize the smooth operation of the OAS.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	The saline infusion pump mounts directly to the intravenous pole and bathes the OAS shaft and crown and provides an electric power supply for the operation of the catheter.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	The constant flow of saline reduces the risk of heat generation and improves the flush of particulates.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	The mechanism of action is a function of the centrifugal force generated by the OAS as they rotate.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	As the speed of the crown's rotation increases, it creates centrifugal force, which increases the crown's orbit and presses the diamond grit coated offset crown against the lesion or plaque, removing a small amount of plaque with each orbit.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	The characteristics of the orbit and the resulting lumen size can be adjusted by modifying two variables:
1180145_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	An increase in speed creates a larger orbital circle, thus accommodating larger diameter vessels.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our current PAD Systems allow the user to choose between three rotational speeds.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	Our CAD System allows the user to choose between two rotational speeds.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	The crowns for the OAS are designed with various weights (as determined by crown geometry and material density) and are coated with diamond grit.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	The PAD System crowns are available in two configurations - classic and solid.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P43_S2	Physicians select crown sizes and configurations based on several case criteria, including reference vessel size, lesion length and degree of stenosis, stenosis morphology, and anatomy tortuosity.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P43_S3	Physicians often use the classic crown configuration in small, more tortuous vessels or when less aggressive sanding is desired.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P43_S4	The solid crown configuration is designed with a tapered, leading edge for frontal sanding, which can be used in tight calcified disease.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P43_S5	The PAD Systems are available with a 1.50 millimeter and 2.00 millimeter classic crown, and 1.25 millimeter, 1.50 millimeter and 2.00 millimeter solid crown configuration.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P43_S6	There is also a 1.25 millimeter solid micro crown available with the Diamondback 360 Peripheral device, which is designed to provide hybrid performance between the classic and solid configurations designed to treat very small arteries in the lower leg and foot.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	Catheter lengths are either 145 centimeters or 60 centimeters, which address procedural approach and target lesion locations both above and below the knee and now below the ankle.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P44_S1	The shorter length catheters are designed for the retrograde pedal approach as opposed to the common femoral artery access point.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	The PAD Systems are versatile in that by adjusting one or more of the speeds in conjunction with crown selection, multiple lesions and vessel sizes can be treated.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	The crown for the CAD System is available in one configuration - 1.25 millimeter classic.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	As the crown moves outward, the centrifugal force is offset by the counterforce exerted by the arterial wall.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	Normal arteries are compliant and have the ability to expand and contract as needed to supply blood flow.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	If the tissue is compliant, it flexes away, rather than generating an opposing force that would allow the OAS to engage and sand the wall.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	Diseased tissue provides resistance and is able to generate an opposing force that allows the OAS to engage and sand the plaque.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	The sanded plaque is broken down into particles generally smaller than circulating red blood cells that are washed away downstream with the patient's natural blood flow.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P49_S2	PAD System testing performed in carbon blocks, animal and cadaver models showed:
1180145_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	greater than 99% of particles were smaller than the lumen of the capillaries (which provide the connection between the arterial and venous system).
1180145_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	The small particle size minimizes the risk of vascular bed overload, or a saturation of the peripheral or coronary vessels with large particles, which may cause slow or reduced blood flow.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	The small size of the particles allow them to be managed by the body's natural cleansing of the blood, including various types of white blood cells that eliminate worn-out cells and other debris in the bloodstream.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	We believe the OAS offer the following key benefits:
1180145_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	Differential Sanding Reduces Risk of Adverse Events.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	The OAS are designed to differentiate between hard plaque and soft compliant arterial tissue.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	Arteries are composed of three tissue layers.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	The diamond grit coated offset crown at the working end of the devices engages and removes plaque from the artery wall with minimal likelihood of penetrating or damaging the fragile, inner layer of the arterial wall because soft, compliant tissue flexes away from the crown.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P55_S2	Furthermore, the OAS have rarely penetrated the middle or outer layers of the artery's wall.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P55_S3	The Diamondback 360 Peripheral's perforation rate was 1.6% during our pivotal OASIS trial.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P55_S4	Analysis by an independent pathology laboratory of more than 434 consecutive cross sections of porcine arteries treated with the Diamondback 360 Peripheral revealed there was minimal to no damage, on average, to the middle layer, which is typically associated with restenosis.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P55_S5	Similarly, the CAD System perforation rate was 1.8% during our pivotal ORBIT II trial.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P55_S6	Analysis by an independent pathology laboratory of more than 443 patients enrolled in the ORBIT II Trial revealed 4 patients had a perforation after the OAS treatment and another 4 patients had a perforation after stent deployment, for a total of 8 perforations reported.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	The small size of the particles produced during sanding avoids the need for plaque collection reservoirs on the catheter and reduces the need for ancillary distal protection devices, commonly used with directional cutting atherectomy devices, and also significantly reduces the risk that larger pieces of removed plaque will block blood flow downstream.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	Allows Continuous Blood Flow During Procedure.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	The OAS allow for continuous blood flow during the procedure, except when initially used in chronic total occlusions.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	Other devices may restrict blood flow due to the size of the catheter required or the use of distal protection devices, which could result in complications such as excessive heat and tissue damage.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	Efficacy Demonstrated for Both PAD and CAD Systems.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	Our pivotal OASIS clinical trial was a prospective 20-center study that involved 124 patients with 201 lesions treated by the Diamondback 360 PAD System.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	Performance targets were established cooperatively with the FDA before the trial began.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P59_S2	Despite 55% of the lesions consisting of calcified plaque, the Diamondback 360 Peripheral successfully met the FDA's study endpoints.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P59_S3	Because the Predator 360 and Stealth 360 mechanism of action is identical to that of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral, no additional efficacy trials were required by the FDA for 510(k) clearance of either PAD System.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	For the CAD System, our ORBIT II coronary OAS trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OAS in treating severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	The trial met both the primary safety and efficacy endpoints by significant margins.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P60_S2	Preparation of severely calcified plaque with the OAS not only helped facilitate stent delivery, but also improved both acute and 30-day clinical outcomes compared with the outcomes of historic control subjects in this difficult-to-treat patient population.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	The pre-procedure mean minimal lumen diameter of 0.5 mm increased to 2.9 mm after the procedure.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P61_S1	The primary safety endpoint was 89.6% freedom from 30-day MACE compared with the performance goal of 83%.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P61_S2	The primary efficacy endpoint (residual stenosis 50% post-stent without in-hospital major adverse cardiac events) was 88.9% compared with the performance goal of 82%.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P61_S3	Stent delivery was successful in 97.7% of cases; 50% stenosis was observed in 98.6% of subjects.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P61_S4	Low rates of in-hospital Q-wave myocardial infarction (0.7%), cardiac death (0.2%), and target vessel revascularization (0.7%) were reported.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	Treats Difficult, Fibrotic and Calcified Lesions.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	The OAS enable physicians to remove plaque from long, fibrotic, calcified or bifurcated lesions, as well as lesions with softer plaque, in peripheral arteries both above and below the knee.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	The orbiting action of the OAS removes the hard plaque in the artery by sanding.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P64_S1	As the crown sands away the plaque, the lumen of the artery is opened and the vessel wall becomes more compliant.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P64_S2	The orbital motion and speed of the crown increases, thus allowing for continuous removal of plaque as the opening of the lumen increases during the operation of the devices.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	The differential sanding of the OAS creates a smooth surface lumen, or channel, inside the vessel.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P65_S1	We believe that the smooth lumens created by the device increase the velocity of blood flow and decrease the resistance to blood flow, which may decrease the potential for restenosis, or renarrowing of the arteries.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	Physicians using the OAS employ techniques similar to those used in angioplasty, which are familiar to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists who are trained in endovascular techniques.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	The devices' simple user interfaces require minimal additional training.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	The orbital technology and differential sanding process of the OAS allows for a single insertion to treat lesions, in most cases.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	Because the particles of plaque sanded away are of such small sizes, the OASs do not require a collection reservoir that needs to be repeatedly emptied or cleaned during the procedure, or add time and cost to the procedure.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P68_S1	Rather, the OAS allow for multiple passes of the device over the lesion until plaque is removed and a smooth lumen is created.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	The unique OAS mechanism of action used in both the PAD and CAD Systems can be used to treat multiple anatomic locations.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	Below-the-Knee and Behind-the-Knee Peripheral Artery Disease.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P70_S1	Arteries below and behind the knee have small diameters and may be diffusely diseased, calcified or both, and reaching and treating these small vessels requires a small form factor which eliminates several competitive devices from being an option.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P70_S2	Behind-the-knee lesions also present challenges if a stent is used because stents frequently fracture due to the forces exerted on the vessels when the knee bends or flexes.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	The PAD Systems are effective in both soft and calcified vessels.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P71_S1	This was demonstrated in the Orbital Atherectomy System for the Treatment of Peripheral Vascular Stenosis ("OASIS") trial, where 94.5% of lesions treated with the Diamondback 360 Peripheral were behind or below the knee.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	The recently introduced Diamondback 360 60cm Peripheral OAS offers a shorter shaft length and a smaller profile and a more flexible shaft than their predecessors for improved ease of use.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	This product uses a 4 French catheter which enables physicians to access lesions below-the-knee using retrograde access (access through the ankle or foot).
1180145_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	Arteries above the knee are typically longer, straighter and wider than below-the-knee vessels.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P74_S1	Plaque in these arteries may also be diffuse, fibrotic and calcific.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	Physicians often use higher speeds or larger crown sizes of our products to treat lesions above the knee.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	CAD occurs when a fatty material called plaque builds up on the walls of arteries that supply blood to the heart.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	The plaque buildup causes the arteries to harden and narrow (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	The OAS has a short treatment time, typically less than two minutes.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	Single Crown Can Create Various Lumen Sizes Limiting Hospital Inventory Costs.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	The OAS orbital mechanism of action allow one device to create various diameter lumens inside the artery.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P79_S1	Adjusting the rotational speed of the crown changes the orbit to create the desired lumen diameter, thereby potentially avoiding the need to use multiple catheters of different sizes to treat multiple lesions.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P80_S0	Single Insertion May Reduce Procedural Time.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P80_S1	Since the physician does not need to insert and remove multiple catheters or clean a plaque collection reservoir to complete the procedure, there is a potential for decreased procedure time.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	Our goal is to be the leading provider of minimally invasive solutions for the treatment of peripheral and coronary disease.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P81_S1	The key elements of our strategy include:
1180145_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	Drive Adoption through Our Direct Sales Organization and Key Opinion Leaders.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P82_S1	We expect to continue to drive adoption of the OAS through our direct sales force in both hospital and office-based lab settings, which targets interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, and interventional radiologists.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P82_S2	As a key element of our strategy, we focus on educating and training physicians on the OAS through our direct sales force and through seminars where physician industry leaders discuss case studies and treatment techniques using the devices.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P83_S0	Collect Additional Clinical Evidence on Benefits of the OAS.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P83_S1	Physicians are increasingly requesting clinical study evidence to allow them to make the best treatment decisions to achieve the best possible short-term and long-term outcomes for their patients.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P83_S2	We are focused on collecting and using clinical evidence to demonstrate the advantages of the OAS and drive physician acceptance.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P84_S0	Enhance OAS and Expand Product Portfolio within the Market for Treatment of Peripheral and Coronary Arteries.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	In addition to enhancing the OAS, we have expanded our product portfolio.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P85_S1	We offer multiple accessory devices designed to complement the use of the OAS.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P85_S2	We are continuing to evaluate internal product development to further expand our portfolio of PAD and CAD treatment solutions.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	With CE Mark expected for both the PAD and CAD Systems in fiscal 2015 and the anticipated coronary approval for the next generation coronary OAS device in Japan during the 2016-2017 timeframe, we are evaluating a variety of options for international expansion to maximize the coronary and peripheral market opportunities.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P86_S1	Sales channels will be based on specific country dynamics.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P86_S2	As a result, distributors - including potential strategic partners - and direct sales channels are being evaluated.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P87_S0	In August 2009, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Asahi to market two peripheral guidewire lines in the United States.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P87_S1	In August 2011, we signed an amendment to expand the agreement to include three additional peripheral guidewires.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P87_S2	The product portfolio now includes the Treasure Floppy and Regalia and three specialty wires: Astato 20, Astato 30, and Treasure 12.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P87_S3	In June 2013, we signed an amendment to extend the exclusive guidewire agreement two more years.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P88_S0	Our healthcare policy initiatives are targeted at raising awareness with public and private payors along with key medical societies on the clinical and economic issues associated with peripheral and coronary arterial calcium.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P88_S1	Working with payors and medical societies over time will sustain coverage for our OAS technology and ensure practice guidelines include appropriate treatment options for patients with arterial calcium.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P89_S0	In addition to adding to our product portfolio through internal development efforts, we intend to continue to explore the acquisition of other product lines, technologies or companies that may leverage our sales force or complement our strategic objectives.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P89_S1	We plan to continue to evaluate distribution agreements, licensing transactions, and other strategic partnerships.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P90_S0	We are committed to providing relevant clinical evidence that enables physicians to select and utilize the best treatment options for their patients.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P90_S1	Our clinical studies incorporate rigorous long-term clinical and healthcare economic data that are critical to improve long-term patient care and ongoing healthcare changes.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P90_S2	We have conducted 14 clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the PAD Systems.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P90_S3	A total of 3,777 patients were enrolled in various studies including our PAD I and PAD II pilot studies, OASIS pivotal study, CONFIRM post market registries, the CALCIUM 360 , COMPLIANCE 360 and CLARITY post market, randomized feasibility studies, the TRUTH post market study, and multiple physician sponsored studies.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P90_S4	The results of these studies consistently demonstrated that the PAD Systems provide predictable, repeatable and durable results that differentiate themselves from other PAD treatments.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P90_S5	The following are PAD clinical studies completed or in process during fiscal 2014:
1180145_14_ITEM1_P91_S0	In September 2005 our IDE was approved to begin OASIS, our pivotal U.S. study.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P91_S1	OASIS was a 124-patient, 20-center, prospective study that began enrollment in January 2006.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P91_S2	The primary efficacy study endpoint was absolute plaque reduction of the target lesions from baseline to immediately post-procedure.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P91_S3	The primary safety endpoint was the cumulative incidence of Serious Adverse Events ("SAE") at 30 days.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P92_S0	In the OASIS study, 94.5% of lesions treated were behind or below the knee, an area where lesions have traditionally gone untreated until they require bypass surgery or amputation.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P92_S1	Of the lesions treated in OASIS, 55% were comprised of calcified plaque, which presents a challenge to proper expansion and apposition of balloons and stents, and 48% were diffuse, or greater than 3 cm in length.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P92_S2	Results of OASIS exceeded FDA pre-specified acceptance criteria with an overall plaque reductions of 59.4%, freedom from SAE of 95.2% device related and 90.3% overall and freedom from TLR of 97.6%.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P93_S0	A prospective, single-arm (non-randomized), post-market study that used IVUS imaging and angiography to assess procedural outcomes in patients who have symptomatic peripheral artery disease who are treated with the Sponsor's OAS and adjunctive balloon angioplasty.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P93_S1	An independent IVUS Core Lab was used to provide adjudicated analyses for IVUS outcomes.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P94_S0	A pilot study designed to identify the clinically appropriate endpoint(s) of a larger, statistically powered pivotal trial for treatment of patients with CLI.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P95_S0	We are currently enrolling up to 1,200 patients in our LIBERTY 360 clinical PAD study, which is a prospective, observational, multi-center clinical study to evaluate acute and long term clinical, quality of life and economic outcomes of endovascular device intervention in patients with distal outflow peripheral arterial disease.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P95_S1	This study is designed with unique endpoints to demonstrate how the PAD Systems provide effective long-term clinical and economic outcomes compared to other treatment alternatives.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P96_S0	CAD, the most common form of heart disease, continues to grow significantly worldwide.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P97_S0	Performing PCI on calcified lesions can lead to MACE rates as high as 24% at 30 days, stent malposition, and a number of procedural complications.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P98_S0	Despite being a relatively common problem, there have been no FDA Investigational Device Exemption ("IDE") premarket approval ("PMA") trials studying only patients with severe coronary calcification, before our ORBIT I and ORBIT II trials.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P99_S0	The ORBIT I feasibility study evaluated performance of the Diamondback 360 for the treatment of de novo calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P99_S1	The ORBIT I study completed in India in 2009 enrolled 50 patients.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P99_S2	The endpoints were measured by device performance, MACE rate, and TLR at six months.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P99_S3	The freedom from MACE at 30 days and at 6 months was 94% and 92% respectively.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P99_S4	The 30-day and 6-month freedom from TLR was 98%.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P99_S5	A single center follow-up of 33 patients demonstrated a freedom MACE of 79% at five year follow up as presented at Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions in May 2014.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P100_S0	In 2010, we began the ORBIT II pivotal study in the U.S, evaluating the use of the CAD System in treating coronary arteries and in October 2013, we received PMA from the FDA.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P100_S1	One year ORBIT II study revascularization rate was significantly lower compared to historic controls with a freedom from cardiac death of 97% in this difficult to treat population and freedom from target lesion revascularization ("TLR") of 95%.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P100_S2	We continue to expand our coronary clinical data with long term clinical and economic data demonstrating positive results for patients treated with the CAD System.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P100_S3	ORBIT II one year patient follow-up was completed in fiscal 2014.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P100_S4	The results were presented at Cardiovascular Research Technologies conference as a Late Breaking Clinical Trial in February 2014.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P100_S5	Results demonstrated a freedom from TLR rate of 95.3% and freedom from MACE rate of 83.6% in this difficult-to-treat patient population of severe calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P100_S6	An economic analysis was also completed that demonstrated a reduction in average length of stay of 2.44 days compared to the MedPAR average length of stay with a 414.4 code of 4.24 days.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P100_S7	The average savings was $4,294 per patient, based on the ORBIT II inpatient economic data of the index procedure costs and the 30-day procedure related readmission costs.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P100_S8	A subsequent economic analysis of ORBIT II economic data using both outpatient and inpatient data resulted in an average savings of $3,200 per patient.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P101_S0	The MACE study is a post market coronary multi-center, prospective study to evaluate major adverse coronary events along with TLR and perforations in the treatment of moderate to severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P101_S1	This registry will include commercially available devices for revascularization involving stent deployment in de novo coronary lesions.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P101_S2	The data from this registry will demonstrate the rate of calcification in the real-world setting as well as examine health care resource utilization.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P102_S0	Enrollment in the 500 patient study has begun at up to 50 U.S. sites.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P102_S1	These patients will be followed up to three years.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P103_S0	This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, global study designed to evaluate performance of the Diamondback 360 Coronary Micro Crown OAS.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P103_S1	This study expands on the already effective current Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS to evaluate the next generation coronary OAS coronary device globally.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P103_S2	We have begun enrolling up to 100 subjects at up to 15 U.S. sites and five sites in Japan.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P103_S3	Minimum enrollment is 50 patients in the U.S. and 25 in Japan.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P104_S0	We market and sell our products through a direct sales force in the United States.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P105_S0	Revenues for the PAD and CAD Systems for fiscal 2014 , fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 were $120.4 million , $91.2 million and $73.0 million , respectively.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P106_S0	We have targeted sales and marketing efforts to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists with experience using similar catheter-based procedures, such as angioplasty, stenting, and cutting or laser atherectomy.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P107_S0	Peer-to-peer education is a key element of our sales strategy.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P108_S0	We target our marketing efforts to practitioners through physician education, medical conferences, seminars, peer-reviewed journals and marketing materials.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P108_S1	Our sales and marketing program focuses on:
1180145_14_ITEM1_P109_S0	developing relationships with key opinion leaders.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P110_S0	We are not currently marketing our products internationally; however, we continue to evaluate international opportunities.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P111_S0	Our research and development efforts are focused in the development of products to penetrate our three key target markets: below and behind-the-knee, above-the-knee, and coronary vessels.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P111_S1	In additional to the key target markets, we also focus on alternative access sites.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P111_S2	Research and development projects include the development of new products, enhancement of existing products, and PAD and CAD clinical trials.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P111_S3	Research and development expenses for fiscal 2014 , fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 were $21.1 million , $15.2 million and $11.4 million , respectively.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P112_S0	We use internally-manufactured and externally-sourced components to manufacture the OAS.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P112_S1	Most of the externally-sourced components are available from multiple suppliers; however, certain key components, including the diamond grit coated crown, and our ViperSlide Lubricant are single sourced.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P112_S2	We have strategies and arrangements in place for procuring our key components from alternative suppliers in the event that one or more of our single source suppliers were to discontinue supplying us with a key component.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P112_S3	We assemble the shaft, crown and handle components on-site, and test, pack, seal and label the finished assembly before sending the packaged product to a contract sterilization facility.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P112_S4	Upon return from the sterilizer, the product is held in inventory prior to shipping to our customers.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P113_S0	Our manufacturing facility in Minnesota, including the shaft manufacturing and the controlled-environment assembly areas, is equipped to accommodate approximately 30,000 devices per shift annually.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P113_S1	It also has storage capacity for approximately 8,000 devices and 100 saline infusion pumps.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P114_S0	Our Pearland, Texas facility is 46,000 square feet and includes a custom-built clean room and production space for future expansion of value-add processes, including machining and electronics assembly.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P114_S1	The facility, when it becomes fully staffed and equipped, will have the capacity to produce approximately 75,000 devices per shift annually.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P114_S2	This facility has finished goods storage capacity for greater than 15,000 OAS devices and other accessory products and over 500 Stealth 360 and Diamondback 360 saline infusion pumps.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P115_S0	We are underway with the construction of a new, 125,000-square-foot, two-story building in Minnesota that will have space for more than 500 employees and contain dedicated research and development, training and education, and manufacturing facilities.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P115_S1	The operations-dedicated space will expand our production and inventory capacity significantly.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P115_S2	Depending on staffing scale, the new facility will have the capacity to produce in excess of 75,000 devices per shift annually.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P115_S3	The finished goods storage capacity for nearly 20,000 devices and more than 500 saline infusion pumps, as well as other accessory products.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P115_S4	Occupancy of the new facility is expected to commence in March 2015, with full transfer of operations by December 2015.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P115_S5	We believe that our current facilities, including the new corporate headquarters, are substantially adequate for our current and anticipated future needs for the foreseeable future.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P116_S0	We are registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P116_S1	We have opted to maintain quality assurance and quality management certifications to enable us to market our products in the member states of the European Union, the European Free Trade Association and countries that have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements with the European Union.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P116_S2	We are ISO 13485:2003 certified, and our renewal is due by December 2015.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P116_S3	Under these registrations, our plants are audited by FDA and our Notified Body for the EU CE mark.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P117_S0	Third-party payors, including private insurers, and government insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, pay for a significant portion of patient care provided in the United States.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P117_S1	The single largest payor in the United States is the Medicare program, a federal governmental health insurance program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS").
1180145_14_ITEM1_P117_S2	Medicare covers certain medical care expenses for eligible elderly and disabled individuals, including a large percentage of the population with PAD and CAD who could be treated with the OAS.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P117_S3	In addition, private insurers often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P117_S4	Consequently, Medicare's coverage and reimbursement policies are important to our operations.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P118_S0	CMS has established Medicare reimbursement codes describing atherectomy products and procedures using atherectomy products.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P118_S1	We believe that physicians and hospitals that treat PAD and CAD with the respective OAS will generally be eligible to receive reimbursement from Medicare, as well as private insurers, for the cost of the single-use catheter and the physician's services.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P119_S0	The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P119_S1	The OAS compete with a variety of other products or devices for the treatment of vascular disease, including stents, balloon angioplasty catheters and atherectomy catheters, as well as products used in vascular surgery.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P119_S2	Large competitors in the stent and balloon angioplasty market segments include Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific, Cook Medical, Johnson Johnson, BARD, and Medtronic.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P119_S3	We also compete against manufacturers of atherectomy catheters including, among others, Covidien, Spectranetics, Boston Scientific and Volcano, as well as other manufacturers that may enter the market due to the increasing demand for treatment of vascular disease.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P119_S4	Other competitors include pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs for the treatment of mild to moderate PAD and CAD and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral and coronary bypass procedures.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P119_S5	We are not aware of any competing catheter systems either currently on the market or in development that also use an orbital motion to create lumens larger than the catheter itself.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P120_S0	Because of the size of the peripheral opportunities, competitors and potential competitors have historically dedicated significant resources to aggressively promote their products.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P120_S1	We believe that the PAD and CAD Systems compete primarily on the basis of:
1180145_14_ITEM1_P121_S0	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and other intellectual property laws, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P121_S1	As of July 29, 2014, we held 42 issued U.S. patents and have 46 U.S. patent applications pending, as well as 148 issued or granted foreign patents and 133 foreign patent applications, each of which corresponds to aspects of our U.S. patents and applications.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P121_S2	Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2014 and 2032, and our most important patents, U.S. Patent No. 6,494,890 and two key design patents covering our eccentric abrasive crown technology are due to expire on June 1, 2019, February 16, 2024 and December 29, 2023, respectively.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P121_S3	In addition, we have many additional patents relating to our core technology currently pending in the USPTO which will extend our key covered subject matter and coverage dates significantly.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P121_S4	Our issued patents and patent applications relate primarily to the design and operation of interventional atherectomy devices, including the PAD Systems.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P121_S5	These patents and applications include claims covering key aspects of orbital atherectomy devices, including the design, manufacture and therapeutic use of certain atherectomy abrasive heads, drive shafts, control systems, handles and couplings.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P121_S6	As we continue to research and develop our atherectomy technology, we intend to file additional U.S. and foreign patent applications related to the design, manufacture and therapeutic uses of atherectomy devices.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P121_S7	In addition, we hold 19 registered U.S. trademarks, 15 registered marks in the Madrid Protocol with protection granted within at least one of Australia, Europe, China, Japan and Mexico, six registered marks in Europe, five registered marks in Canada, five registered marks in Mexico, and nine registered marks in Hong Kong.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P121_S8	We hold five trademark applications pending in the U.S, 12 trademark applications pending in Canada and 16 trademark applications pending in India.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P122_S0	We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P122_S1	We seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P122_S2	Agreements with our employees also forbid them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P122_S3	We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P123_S0	Governmental authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local levels and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of medical devices such as the PAD and CAD Systems.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P124_S0	Failure to obtain approval to market our products under development and to meet the ongoing requirements of these regulatory authorities could prevent us from marketing and continuing to market our products.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P125_S0	The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and the FDA s implementing regulations govern medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post market surveillance.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P125_S1	Medical devices and their manufacturers are also subject to inspection by the FDA.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P125_S2	The FDCA, supplemented by other federal and state laws, also provides civil and criminal penalties for violations of its provisions.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P126_S0	We manufacture and market medical devices that are regulated by the FDA, comparable state agencies and regulatory bodies in other countries.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P127_S0	Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P128_S0	The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization are premarket notification (also called 510(k) clearance) and premarket approval (also called PMA approval).
1180145_14_ITEM1_P129_S0	The type of marketing authorization applicable to a device - 510(k) clearance or PMA approval - is generally linked to classification of the device.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P130_S0	The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk FDA determines to be associated with a device and the extent of control deemed necessary to ensure the device s safety and effectiveness.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P130_S1	Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P130_S2	Class I devices are deemed to pose the least risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling, premarket notification, and adherence to the FDA s current good manufacturing practice requirements, as reflected in its Quality System Regulation ("QSR").
1180145_14_ITEM1_P130_S3	Class II devices are intermediate risk devices that are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post market surveillance.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P130_S4	Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, and include life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, and devices not substantially equivalent to a device that is already legally marketed.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P130_S5	Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from FDA.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P130_S6	Class I and Class II devices that have not been so exempted are eligible for marketing through the 510(k) clearance pathway.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P130_S7	By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require PMA approval prior to commercial marketing.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P130_S8	The PMA approval process is generally more stringent, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) clearance process.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P131_S0	To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device legally marketed in the United States.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P131_S1	A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P131_S2	A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P132_S0	Generally, the 510(k) clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a year or more.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P133_S0	After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval (if the device as modified is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device).
1180145_14_ITEM1_P133_S1	The determination as to whether new authorization is needed is initially left to the manufacturer; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P133_S2	The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P134_S0	We received 510(k) clearance for use of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral as a therapy in patients with PAD in the United States on August 22, 2007.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P134_S1	We received additional 510(k) clearances for the control unit used with the Diamondback 360 Peripheral on October 25, 2007 and for the solid crown version of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral on November 9, 2007.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P134_S2	We were granted 510(k) clearance of the Predator 360 in March 2009 and Stealth 360 in March 2011.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P134_S3	We received 510(k) clearance of the Diamondback 360 60cm Peripheral OAS in March 2014.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P135_S0	A PMA application requires the payment of significant user fees and must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P135_S1	A PMA application must also include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P136_S0	an in-depth review of the submitted information.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P136_S1	During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P136_S2	Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P136_S3	In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with the FDA s QSR which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P137_S0	FDA review of a PMA application is required by statute to take no longer than 180 days, although the process typically takes significantly longer, and may require several years to complete.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P137_S1	The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
1180145_14_ITEM1_P138_S0	changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P139_S0	If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P139_S1	When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P139_S2	If the FDA s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P139_S3	The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P139_S4	Even if a PMA application is approved, the FDA may approve the device with an indication that is narrower or more limited than originally sought.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P139_S5	The agency can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of the device as a condition of approval, or impose post approval requirements such as continuing evaluation and periodic reporting on the safety, efficacy and reliability of the device for its intended use.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P140_S0	New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P140_S1	PMA approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P141_S0	The FDA granted unconditional IDE approval in April 2010 to begin the ORBIT II coronary trial in the United States.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P141_S1	This pivotal trial was set up in two phases; Phase I allowed us to enroll up to 100 patients at as many as 50 U.S. sites, Phase II allowed us to expand the trial to the full complement of 429 patients.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P141_S2	In May 2011, we received approval from the FDA to complete enrollment of 429 patients in our ORBIT II clinical trial for a coronary application for the Diamondback 360, which followed the FDA s review of data from the first 50 cases in the ORBIT II trial.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P141_S3	In July 2012, we received approval from the FDA to include the new electric coronary device (similar to Stealth 360 technology used in PAD and customized specifically for the coronary application), which improves ease of use.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P141_S4	The FDA required 100 enrollments with the new electric coronary device and would have allowed up to 50 additional patients in the trial, as needed, to achieve that enrollment level.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P141_S5	A total of 443 patients were enrolled in the trial.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P142_S0	In March 2013, we completed submission of our PMA application to the FDA for our orbital atherectomy system to treat calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P142_S1	In October 2013, we received PMA approval from the FDA to market the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P142_S2	We commenced a controlled commercial launch of the CAD System following receipt of PMA approval.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P143_S0	Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P143_S1	These trials generally require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P143_S2	The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P143_S3	The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non- significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P143_S4	Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P143_S5	FDA approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P143_S6	With certain exceptions, changes made to an investigational plan after an IDE is approved must be submitted in an IDE supplement and approved by FDA (and by governing institutional review boards when appropriate) prior to implementation.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P144_S0	All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with regulations and requirements collectively known as good clinical practice.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P144_S1	Good clinical practices include the FDA s IDE regulations, which describe the conduct of clinical trials with medical devices, including the recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of sponsors and investigators, and labeling of investigation devices.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P144_S2	They also prohibit promotion, test marketing or commercialization of an investigational device and any representation that such a device is safe or effective for the purposes being investigated.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P144_S3	Good clinical practices also include the FDA s regulations for institutional review board approval and for protection of human subjects (such as informed consent), as well as disclosure of financial interests by clinical investigators.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P145_S0	Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P145_S1	The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P145_S2	The commencement or completion of any clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application or clearance of a premarket notification for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:
1180145_14_ITEM1_P146_S0	the FDA concludes that the trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P147_S0	After a device is cleared or approved for use and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P148_S0	product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device that may present a risk to health.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P149_S0	In addition, the FDA may require a company to conduct post market surveillance studies or order it to establish and maintain a system for tracking its products through the chain of distribution to the patient level.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P150_S0	Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions:
1180145_14_ITEM1_P151_S0	We and our contract manufacturers, specification developers and suppliers are also required to manufacture our products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements set forth in the QSR.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P152_S0	The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing and record keeping.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P152_S1	The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P152_S2	If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers is not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to clear or approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P152_S3	Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P153_S0	Our operations will be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the FDCA, federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P153_S1	These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P153_S2	In addition, these laws require us to screen individuals and other companies, suppliers and vendors in order to ensure that they are not debarred by the federal government and therefore prohibited from doing business in the healthcare industry.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P154_S0	The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P154_S1	Several courts have interpreted the statute s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P155_S0	The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P155_S1	Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P156_S0	The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P156_S1	Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P157_S0	In addition to the laws described above, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P158_S0	The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P158_S1	The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P159_S0	On May 8, 2014, we received a letter from the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Western District of North Carolina stating that it is investigating the Company to determine whether we had violated the False Claims Act, resulting in the submission of false claims to federal and state health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P159_S1	The letter enclosed a Civil Investigative Demand ( CID ) for written interrogatories and document requests.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P159_S2	We maintain rigorous policies and procedures to promote compliance with the False Claims Act and other regulatory requirements, and are working with the U.S. Attorney s Office to promptly respond to the CID.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P159_S3	However, we cannot predict when the investigation will be resolved, the outcome of this investigation or its potential impact on the Company.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P160_S0	The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, was enacted by Congress in 2010 as part of the comprehensive health care reform legislation, and the implementing Open Payment regulations, released in February 2013, require persons to begin collecting certain data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals beginning in August 2013 for public reporting by the end of June 2014.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P161_S0	It is widely anticipated that public reporting under the Sunshine Act and implementing Open Payment regulations will result in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P162_S0	Voluntary industry codes, federal guidance documents and a variety of state laws address the tracking and reporting of marketing practices relative to gifts given and other expenditures made to doctors and other healthcare professionals.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P162_S1	In addition to impacting our marketing and educational programs, internal business processes will be affected by the numerous legal requirements and regulatory guidance at the state, federal and industry levels.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P163_S0	International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P163_S1	The time required to obtain approval in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P163_S2	For example, the primary regulatory environment in Europe with respect to medical devices is that of the European Union, which includes most of the major countries in Europe.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P163_S3	Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P164_S0	The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P164_S1	Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the European Union, although actual implementation of these directives may vary on a country-by-country basis.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P165_S0	The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of submission of a design dossier, self-assessment by the manufacturer, a third-party assessment and, review of the design dossier by a Notified Body.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P165_S1	This third-party assessment generally consists of an audit of the manufacturer s quality system and manufacturing site, as well as review of the technical documentation used to support application of the CE Mark to one s product and possibly specific testing of the manufacturer s product.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P166_S0	An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the European Union is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P167_S0	In addition, any international expansion, operations and sales that we undertake will require us to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similiar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions and with U.S. and foreign export control, trade embargo and custom laws.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P168_S0	Our operations are subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P168_S1	We are currently classified and licensed as a Very Small Quantity Hazardous Waste Generator within Ramsey County, Minnesota.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P168_S2	There are no regulated wastes requiring licensing in our Texas facility.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P169_S0	As of June 30, 2014 , we had 479 employees, including 112 employees in manufacturing, 224 employees in sales, 33 employees in marketing, 33 employees in clinical, 43 employees in general and administrative, and 34 employees in research and development, all of which are full-time employees.
1180145_14_ITEM1_P169_S1	None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We have a history of net losses and a short commercialization experience, and we are likely to continue to incur losses.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We are not profitable and have incurred net losses in each fiscal year since our formation in 1989.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In particular, we had net losses of $35.3 million in fiscal 2014, $24.0 million in fiscal 2013 and $16.8 million in fiscal 2012.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	As of June 30, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $238.6 million.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	We commenced commercial sales of the PAD Systems in September 2007 and the CAD System in October 2013, and our short commercialization experience makes it difficult for us to predict future performance.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P1_S4	We also expect to incur significant additional expenses for sales and marketing, research and development and manufacturing as we continue to commercialize the PAD and CAD Systems and additional expenses as we seek to develop and commercialize future versions of the PAD and CAD Systems and any future products.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Additionally, we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as our business grows.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P1_S6	As a result, our operating losses are likely to continue.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We may be unable to sustain our revenue growth.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our revenue has grown in each of the fiscal years since we commenced commercial sales of the PAD Systems in September 2007.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our ability to continue to increase our revenues in future periods will depend on our ability to increase sales of the PAD Systems and generate significant sales from the CAD System and new and improved products we introduce, which will in turn depend in part on our success in growing our customer base and reorders from those customers, and obtaining new applications for our technology.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We may not be able to generate, sustain or increase revenues on a quarterly or annual basis.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	If we cannot achieve or sustain revenue growth for an extended period, our financial results will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Economic conditions may adversely affect our business.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Adverse worldwide economic conditions may negatively impact our business.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	A significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of our customers could cause unfavorable trends in their purchases and also in our receivable collections and additional allowances may be required, which could adversely affect our operating results.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Adverse worldwide economic conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers' ability to provide us with materials and components, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The PAD Systems, the CAD System and future products may never achieve broad market acceptance.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The PAD and CAD Systems and future products we may develop may never gain broad market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The degree of market acceptance of any of our products will depend on a number of factors, including:
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	the level of education and awareness among physicians and hospitals concerning our products.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Failure of the PAD and CAD Systems to significantly penetrate current or new markets would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our customers may not be able to achieve adequate reimbursement for using the PAD and CAD Systems which could affect the acceptance of our products and cause our business to suffer.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved medical devices and procedures is uncertain.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The commercial success of our products is substantially dependent on whether third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement for the use of such products and related services are available.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We expect our products to continue to be purchased by hospitals and other providers who will then seek reimbursement from various public and private third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers, for the services provided to patients.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P11_S3	While third-party payors are currently providing reimbursement for our products, we can give no assurance that these third-party payors will continue to provide adequate reimbursement for use of the PAD and CAD Systems to permit hospitals and doctors to consider the products cost-effective for patients requiring treatment, or that current reimbursement levels for our products will continue.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P11_S4	In addition, the overall amount of reimbursement available for PAD and CAD treatment could decrease in the future.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain sufficient reimbursement could cause our business to suffer.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement, and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for use of our products.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In order to position our products for acceptance by third-party payors, we may have to agree to lower prices than we might otherwise charge.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Governmental and private sector payors have instituted initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs using, for example, price regulation or controls and competitive pricing programs.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Some third-party payors also require demonstrated superiority, on the basis of randomized clinical trials, or pre-approval of coverage, for new or innovative devices or procedures before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such devices or procedures.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	It is uncertain whether our current products or any future products we may develop will be viewed as sufficiently cost-effective to warrant adequate coverage and reimbursement levels.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products is limited or not available, the acceptance of our products and, consequently, our business will be substantially harmed.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Healthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	There have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control healthcare costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system, some of which have been enacted into law, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Patient Act.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The Patient Act imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers and these taxes have begun to adversely affect our financial results.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The Patient Act and any additional healthcare proposals and laws that may be enacted in the future could also limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	The Patient Act and future healthcare legislation could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our financial performance may be adversely affected by medical device tax provisions in the health care reform legislation.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The imposition of the 2.3% medical device excise tax enacted as part of the Patient Act has required, and will continue to require, us to identify ways to reduce spending in other areas or raise additional capital to offset the increased expense.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We have not been able to pass along the cost of the tax to our customers or offset the cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting from the expansion of health insurance coverage, and do not expect to be able to do so in the future, because of the demographics of the current uninsured population.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The regulations put forth by the U.S. Department of Treasury in late 2012 did little to lessen the burden of complying with the excise tax statute.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Ongoing implementation of this legislation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We have limited data and experience regarding the safety and efficacy of the PAD and CAD Systems.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Any long-term data that is generated may not be positive or consistent with our limited short-term data, which would affect market acceptance of these products.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Because our technology is relatively new in the treatment of PAD and CAD, we have performed clinical trials only with limited patient populations.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The long-term effects of using the PAD and CAD Systems in a large number of patients have not been studied and the results of short-term clinical use of the PAD or CAD Systems do not necessarily predict long-term clinical benefits or reveal long-term adverse effects.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Clinical trials conducted with the PAD and CAD Systems have involved procedures performed by physicians who are very technically proficient.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Consequently, both short and long-term results reported in these studies may be significantly more favorable than typical results achieved by physicians, which could negatively impact market acceptance of the PAD and CAD Systems and materially harm our business.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We face significant competition, must innovate to stay competitive, and may be unable to sell the PAD or CAD Systems at profitable levels.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The market for medical devices is highly competitive, dynamic and marked by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovation.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our ability to compete depends on our ability to innovate successfully, and while certain barriers exist to entry into our market we cannot assure that new entrants or existing competitors will not be able to develop products that compete directly with our products.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We compete against very large and well-known stent and balloon angioplasty device manufacturers, atherectomy catheter manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral and coronary bypass procedures.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	We may have difficulty competing effectively with these competitors because of their well-established positions in the marketplace, significant financial and human capital resources, established reputations and worldwide distribution channels.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	develop more effective or less expensive products or technologies that render our technology or products obsolete or non-competitive.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We have encountered and expect to continue to encounter potential customers who, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to or prefer the products offered by these competitors.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	If we are unable to compete successfully, our revenue will suffer.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Increased competition might lead to price reductions and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Competitive pressures may decrease the demand for our products and could adversely affect our financial results.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We have limited commercial manufacturing experience and could experience difficulty in producing the PAD and CAD Systems or may need to depend on third parties to manufacture the products.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We have limited experience in commercially manufacturing the PAD Systems, even less experience in commercially manufacturing the CAD System and no experience manufacturing these products in the volume that we anticipate will be required if we achieve planned levels of commercial sales.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	As a result, we may not be able to develop and implement efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to manufacture the PAD and CAD Systems or future products in significant volumes, while meeting the legal, regulatory, quality, price, durability, engineering, design and production standards required to market our products successfully.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The forecasts of demand we use to determine order quantities and lead times for components purchased from outside suppliers may be incorrect.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our failure to obtain required components or subassemblies when needed and at a reasonable cost would adversely affect our business.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In addition, we may in the future need to depend upon third parties to manufacture the PAD and CAD Systems and future products.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Any difficulties in locating and hiring third-party manufacturers, or in the ability of third-party manufacturers to supply quantities of our products at the times and in the quantities we need, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We depend upon third-party suppliers, including single source suppliers to us and our customers, making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We rely on third-party suppliers to provide us with certain components of our products and to provide key components or supplies to our customers for use with our products.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We rely on single source suppliers for certain components of the PAD and CAD Systems.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	We depend on our suppliers to provide us and our customers with materials in a timely manner that meet our and their quality, quantity and cost requirements.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P32_S3	These suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand and our customers' demands.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Any supply interruption from our suppliers or failure to obtain additional suppliers for any of the components used in our products would limit our ability to manufacture our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We may need to increase the size of our organization and we may experience difficulties managing growth.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business, our future revenue and operating results may be adversely affected.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The growth we may experience in the future may provide challenges to our organization, requiring us to rapidly expand our sales and marketing personnel and manufacturing operations.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Rapid expansion in personnel may result in less experienced people producing and selling our products, which could result in unanticipated costs and disruptions to our operations.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If we cannot scale and manage our business appropriately, our anticipated growth may be impaired and our financial results will suffer.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We intend to sell our products internationally in the future, but we may experience difficulties in obtaining approval to do so or in successfully marketing our products internationally even if approved.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Currently, all of our revenues are in the U.S.; however, we intend to sell internationally in the future and have commenced the process of seeking approval to do so in both Europe and Japan.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	There can be no guarantee that we will receive approval to sell our products internationally, nor can there be any guarantee that any sales would result even if such approval is received.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Additionally, movement into international markets would subject us and our products to different and increased laws and regulations, which could negatively affect our financial results and increase our regulatory expenses.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We may require additional financing, and our failure to obtain additional financing when needed could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We may be dependent on additional financing to execute our business plan.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	In the event we need or desire additional financing, we may be unable to obtain it by borrowing money in the credit markets or raising money in the capital markets.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P39_S3	If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, we may terminate or delay the development of one or more of our products, or delay establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We face a risk of non-compliance with the financial covenants in our loan and security agreements with Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We are party to loan and security agreements with Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	These agreements require us to maintain, among other things, a monthly specified liquidity ratio and contain customary events of default, including, among others, the failure to comply with certain covenants or other agreements.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, amounts due under the agreements may be accelerated by Silicon Valley Bank or Partners for Growth.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	If we are unable to meet the financial or other covenants under the current loan and security agreements or negotiate future waivers or amendments of such covenants, events of default could occur under the agreements.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the agreements, Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth have available a range of remedies customary in these circumstances, including declaring all outstanding debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to be due and payable, foreclosing on the assets securing the agreements and/or ceasing to provide additional loans, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The restrictive covenants under these agreements could limit our ability to obtain future financing, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The financial and restrictive covenants contained in the agreements could also adversely affect our ability to respond to changing economic and business conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies that may be subject to fewer restrictions.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Transactions that we may view as important opportunities, such as acquisitions, may be subject to the consent of Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth, which consents may be withheld or granted subject to conditions specified at the time that may affect the attractiveness or viability of the transaction.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We are dependent on our senior management team and highly skilled personnel, and our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain personnel necessary for our success.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We are highly dependent on our senior management.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Our success will depend on our ability to retain senior management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, including scientists, clinicians, engineers and other highly skilled personnel and to integrate current and additional personnel in all departments.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P45_S2	The loss of members of our senior management, scientists, clinical and regulatory specialists, engineers and sales personnel could prevent us from achieving our objectives of continuing to grow our company.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P45_S3	We do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our stock price is volatile and subject to significant fluctuations.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Market prices for securities of early-stage pharmaceutical, medical device, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Our common stock traded as low as $18.83 and as high as $37.73 per share during the 12-month period ended June 30, 2014.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Moreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P49_S1	These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by 5-percent shareholders that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We may have experienced an ownership change in the past and we may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock, some of which may be outside our control.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards or other pre-change tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitations.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Our ability to market the PAD Systems in the United States is limited to use as a therapy in patients with PAD and our ability to market the CAD System in the United States is limited to use as a therapy in patients with coronary artery disease, and if we want to expand our marketing claims, we will need to file for additional FDA clearances or approvals and conduct further clinical trials, which would be expensive and time consuming and may not be successful.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The PAD Systems received FDA 510(k) clearances in the United States for use as a therapy in patients with PAD, and in October 2013, we received PMA approval to use the CAD System as a therapy in patients with coronary artery disease.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P55_S1	These general clearances and approvals restrict our ability to market or advertise the PAD Systems and the CAD System beyond these uses and could affect our growth.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	If we determine to market our orbital technology in the United States for other uses, we would need to conduct further clinical trials and obtain premarket approval from the FDA.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Clinical trials are complex, expensive, time consuming, uncertain and subject to substantial and unanticipated delays.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P56_S2	There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain FDA approval to use our orbital atherectomy technology for applications other than the treatment of PAD and coronary artery disease.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We are or will be subject to an extensive set of post-market controls that apply to us as we commercialize our products, including annual PMA reports, Medical Device Reports on serious adverse events, complaint handling and analysis under the FDA's Quality System Regulation ("QSR"), export controls, advertising and promotion requirements, and potential post-market studies required by the FDA.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We and our suppliers are also subject to regulation by various state authorities, which may inspect our or our suppliers' facilities and manufacturing processes and enforce state regulations.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Failure to comply with applicable state regulations may result in seizures, injunctions or other types of enforcement actions.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Our promotion of the PAD and CAD Systems is closely controlled by the FDA and enforcement activities could limit our ability to inform potential customers of the features of the products.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The PAD Systems or the CAD System may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation and product liability claims that could exceed the limits of available insurance coverage.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material regulatory deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P61_S1	For example, since commercialization of the PAD Systems, we have had minor instances of recall involving a single lot of Diamondback 360 Peripheral devices, two boxes of ViperWire products, and 70 lots of Stealth 360 devices, related to Use By date labeling issues; a recall of unused ViperSheath products, which we formerly distributed for Thomas Medical Products; a recall involving six lots of Stealth 360 micro crown devices due to the potential for an insufficient solder bond; a recall of 318 Diamondback 318 Coronary devices due to incorrect saline catheter specifications; and a recall involving 48 Diamondback 360 Peripheral devices due to issues with the polymer coating on the saline sheath.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Any recalls of our products or products that we distribute would divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation with customers and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Also, if the PAD or CAD Systems are defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contain defective components or are misused, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P62_S1	The use, misuse or off-label use of the PAD or CAD Systems may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P62_S2	We cannot prevent a physician from using the PAD or CAD Systems for off-label applications.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P62_S3	While we have product liability insurance coverage for our products and intend to maintain such insurance coverage in the future, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected from claims that are brought against us.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We are subject to many laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The PAD and CAD Systems and related manufacturing processes, clinical data, adverse events, recalls or corrections and promotional activities are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory bodies.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P64_S1	In particular, we are required to comply with the QSR and other regulations, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product for which we obtain marketing clearance or approval.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P64_S2	We are also responsible for the quality of components received by our suppliers.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Failure to comply with the QSR requirements or other statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or failure to adequately respond to any observations, could result in, among other things:
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	If any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales to suffer.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Our operations are also subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	In addition, our relationships with physicians, hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny under various federal anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws, as further described below.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	If our operations are found to be in violation of these laws, we, as well as our employees, may be subject to penalties, including monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration health programs, workers' compensation programs and TRICARE (the healthcare system administered by or on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense for uniformed services beneficiaries, including active duty and their dependents, retirees and their dependents), and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting kickbacks and false and fraudulent claims which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Additionally, any challenges to or investigations into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, and similar state laws, prohibit payments that are intended to induce health care professionals or others either to refer patients or to purchase, lease, order or arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease or order of healthcare products or services.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P70_S1	A number of states have enacted laws that require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report payments, gifts and other remuneration made to physicians and other health care professionals and health care organizations.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P70_S2	In addition, some state statutes, most notably laws in Massachusetts and Vermont, impose outright bans on certain gifts to physicians as well as requiring reporting of payments to physicians.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P70_S3	Some of these laws, referred to as aggregate spend or gift laws, carry substantial fines if they are violated.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Beginning in August 2013, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, which was enacted by Congress in 2010 as part of the comprehensive health care reform legislation, and the implementing Open Payments regulations under the Sunshine Act, released in February 2013, require us to collect certain data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Public reporting of such information commenced in June 2014.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	It is widely anticipated that public reporting under the Sunshine Act and implementing Open Payments regulations will result in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P72_S1	These anti-kickback, public reporting and aggregate spend laws affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers or users of medical devices.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P72_S2	They also impose additional administrative and compliance burdens on us.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P72_S3	In particular, these laws influence, among other things, how we structure our sales offerings, including discount practices, customer support, education and training programs and physician consulting and other service arrangements.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P72_S4	If we were to offer or pay inappropriate inducements to purchase our products, we could be subject to a claim under the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute or similar state laws.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P72_S5	If we fail to comply with particular reporting requirements, we could be subject to penalties under applicable federal or state laws.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P72_S6	Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payments to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or for items or services that were not provided as claimed.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P72_S7	Although we do not submit claims directly to government healthcare programs or other payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims by providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, by providing improper financial inducements, or through certain other activities.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	In providing billing and coding information to customers, we make every effort to ensure that the billing and coding information furnished is accurate and that treating physicians understand that they are responsible for all treatment decisions.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Nevertheless, we cannot provide assurance that the government will regard any billing errors that may be made as inadvertent or that the government will not examine our role in providing information to our customers and physicians concerning the benefits of therapy with our devices.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Likewise, our financial relationships with customers, physicians, or others in a position to influence the purchase or use of our products may be subject to government scrutiny or be alleged or found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	False claims laws prescribe civil, criminal and administrative penalties for noncompliance, which can be substantial.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Moreover, an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business and results of operations.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	For example, on May 8, 2014, we received a letter from the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Western District of North Carolina stating that it is investigating the Company to determine whether we had violated the False Claims Act, resulting in the submission of false claims to federal and state health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P75_S1	The letter enclosed a Civil Investigative Demand ( CID ) for written interrogatories and document requests.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P75_S2	We maintain rigorous policies and procedures to promote compliance with the False Claims Act and other regulatory requirements, and are working with the U.S. Attorney s Office to promptly respond to the CID.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P75_S3	However, we cannot predict when the investigation will be resolved, the outcome of this investigation or its potential impact on the Company.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses, may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries, as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer's efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P77_S1	These disclosure requirements require ongoing due diligence efforts and disclosure on Form SD in May of each year for the prior calendar year.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P77_S2	We filed our initial Form SD in May 2014.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P77_S3	There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P77_S4	In addition, our ongoing implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could allow our competitors and others to produce products based on our technology, which could substantially impair our ability to compete.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Our success and ability to compete depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P79_S1	We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Our issued patents and related intellectual property may not be adequate to protect us or permit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P79_S3	Also, we cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P79_S4	Further, if any patents we obtain or license are deemed invalid and unenforceable, or have their scope narrowed, it could impact our ability to commercialize or license our technology and achieve competitive advantages.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P80_S1	In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, if at all.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We may, in the future, need to assert claims of infringement against third parties to protect our intellectual property.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P81_S1	The outcome of litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in patents, copyrights, trade secrets or trademarks is highly unpredictable, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, reputation and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Despite our efforts to safeguard our unpatented and unregistered intellectual property rights, we may not be successful in doing so or the steps taken by us in this regard may not be adequate to detect or deter misappropriation of our technology or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our products, technology or other information that we regard as proprietary.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P82_S1	In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to litigate, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Additionally, third parties may be able to design around our patents.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P83_S1	In this regard, we seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by having a policy that our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P83_S2	We cannot provide any assurance that employees and third parties will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements, or that we will be effective in securing necessary assignments from these third parties.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others could prohibit us from commercializing products, require us to obtain licenses from third parties or require us to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages and injunctive relief.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P85_S0	The medical technology industry is characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P85_S1	The likelihood that patent infringement or misappropriation claims may be brought against us increases as we achieve more visibility in the marketplace and introduce products to market.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We are aware of numerous patents issued to third parties that relate to the manufacture and use of medical devices for the treatment of vascular disease.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P86_S1	The owners of each of these patents could assert that the manufacture, use or sale of our products infringes one or more claims of their patents.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P86_S2	There could also be existing patents of which we are unaware that one or more aspects of our technology may inadvertently infringe.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P86_S3	In some cases, litigation may be threatened or brought by a patent-holding company or other adverse patent owner who has no relevant product revenues and against whom our patents may provide little or no deterrence.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Any infringement or misappropriation claim could cause us to incur significant costs, place significant strain on our financial resources, divert management's attention from our business and harm our reputation.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P87_S1	If the relevant patents were upheld in litigation as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe, we could be prohibited from commercializing any infringing products unless we could obtain licenses to use the technology covered by the patent or are able to design around the patent.
1180145_14_ITEM1A_P87_S2	We may be unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may not be able to redesign any infringing products to avoid infringement.
1180145_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal executive offices are located in a 47,000 square foot facility in St. Paul, Minnesota.
1180145_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	We have leased this facility through November 2015 with an option to renew through November 2020.
1180145_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	In September 2013, we leased an additional 13,000 square foot office facility located in St. Paul, Minnesota which is leased through November 2015.
1180145_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	These facilities accommodate our research and development, sales, marketing, manufacturing, finance and administrative activities.
1180145_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	In September 2009, we entered into an agreement to lease a 46,000 square foot production facility in Pearland, Texas beginning in April 2010 through March 2020.
1180145_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	This facility primarily accommodates additional manufacturing activities.
1180145_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	In June 2014, we announced plans to build a new corporate headquarters in New Brighton, Minnesota.
1180145_14_ITEM2_P2_S1	The 125,000-square-foot, two-story building will have space for more than 500 employees and contain dedicated research and development, training and education, and manufacturing facilities.
1180145_14_ITEM2_P2_S2	This new facility will replace the two St. Paul, Minnesota leased facilities above.
1180145_14_ITEM2_P3_S0	We believe that our current facilities, including the new corporate headquarters, are substantially adequate for our current and anticipated future needs for the foreseeable future.

1180145_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	CSI trades on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol CSII.
1180145_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for our common stock (based upon intra-day trading) as reported by the Nasdaq Global Market:
1180145_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	The number of record holders of our common stock on August 22, 2014 was approximately 231.
1180145_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	No cash dividends have been previously paid on our common stock and none are anticipated during fiscal year 2015.
1180145_14_ITEM5_P1_S2	We are restricted from paying dividends under our Loan and Security Agreements with Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information).
1180145_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	For information on our equity compensation plans, refer to Item 12, Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.
1180145_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	We were incorporated as Replidyne, Inc. ("Replidyne") in Delaware in 2000.
1180145_14_ITEM5_P3_S1	On February 25, 2009, Replidyne completed its business combination with Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., a Minnesota corporation ( CSI-MN ), in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of November 3, 2008, by and among Replidyne, Responder Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Replidyne ( Merger Sub ), and CSI-MN (the Merger Agreement ).
1180145_14_ITEM5_P3_S2	Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into CSI-MN, with CSI-MN continuing after the merger as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Replidyne.
1180145_14_ITEM5_P3_S3	At the effective time of the merger, Replidyne changed its name to Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. ("CSI") and CSI-MN changed its name to CSI Minnesota, Inc.
1180145_14_ITEM5_P3_S4	Following the merger of Merger Sub with CSI-MN, CSI-MN merged with and into CSI, with CSI continuing after the merger as the surviving corporation.

1180145_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many important factors, including the factors we describe under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are a medical device company focused on developing and commercializing interventional treatment systems for vascular disease.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our peripheral arterial disease ("PAD") products, the Stealth 360 PAD System (the "Stealth 360"), the Diamondback 360 PAD Systems (the Diamondback 360 Peripheral ) and the Diamondback Predator 360 (the "Predator 360") are catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of plaque types in leg arteries both above and below the knee and address many of the limitations associated with existing treatment alternatives.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	In March 2014, we received approval for the Diamondback 360 60cm Peripheral OAS access device which allows physicians to treat PAD patients in the small and tortuous vessels located below the knee through alternative access sites in the ankle or foot.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P1_S3	We have also obtained approval to market our Diamondback 360 Coronary Orbital Atherectomy System ("CAD System") as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	We were incorporated as Replidyne, Inc. ("Replidyne") in Delaware in 2000.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	On February 25, 2009, Replidyne completed its business combination with Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., a Minnesota corporation ( CSI-MN ), in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of November 3, 2008 (the Merger Agreement ).
1180145_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, CSI-MN continued after the merger as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Replidyne.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P2_S3	Replidyne changed its name to Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. ( CSI ) and CSI-MN merged with and into CSI, with CSI continuing after the merger as the surviving corporation.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P2_S4	These transactions are referred to herein as the merger.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Replidyne was a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, in-licensing and commercializing anti-infective products.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	CSI-MN was incorporated in Minnesota in 1989.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	From 1989 to 1997, we engaged in research and development on several different product concepts.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	Since 1997, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development of the PAD Systems and, since 2007, to the approval of our CAD System.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	From 2003 to 2005, we conducted numerous bench and animal tests in preparation for application submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA").
1180145_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	We initially focused our testing on providing a solution for coronary in-stent restenosis, but later changed the focus to PAD.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	In 2006, we obtained an investigational device exemption from the FDA to conduct our pivotal OASIS PAD clinical trial, which was completed in January 2007.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P5_S3	The OASIS clinical trial was a prospective 20-center study that involved 124 patients with 201 lesions.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	In August 2007, the FDA granted us 510(k) clearance for the use of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral as a therapy in patients with PAD.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	We commenced commercial introduction of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral in the United States in September 2007.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	We were granted 510(k) clearance of the Predator 360 in March 2009 and Stealth 360 in March 2011.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	We received 510(k) clearance of the Diamondback 360 60cm Peripheral OAS in March 2014.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P6_S4	We market the PAD Systems in the United States through a direct sales force and expend significant capital on our sales and marketing efforts to expand our customer base and utilization per customer.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P6_S5	We assemble at our facilities the saline infusion pump and the single-use catheter used in the PAD Systems with components purchased from third-party suppliers, as well as with components manufactured in-house.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P6_S6	Supplemental products are purchased from third-party suppliers.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	We have developed modified versions of the PAD System to treat coronary arteries.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	A coronary application required us to conduct a clinical trial and file a premarket application ("PMA"), and obtain approval from the FDA.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	In March 2013, we completed submission of our PMA application to the FDA for our orbital atherectomy system to treat calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	In October 2013, we received PMA from the FDA to market the Diamondback 360 Coronary Orbital Atherectomy System ( OAS ) as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P8_S3	We commenced a controlled commercial launch of CAD System following receipt of PMA approval.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	As of June 30, 2014 , we had an accumulated deficit of $238.6 million .
1180145_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	We expect our losses to continue as we invest in sales, marketing, medical education, clinical studies and product research and development for our next phase of growth in the peripheral market and broaden the commercial launch of our CAD System.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	To date, we have financed our operations primarily from the issuance of common and preferred stock, convertible promissory notes, and debt.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	We derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of PAD Systems, the CAD System and other ancillary products.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	The PAD and CAD Systems each use a disposable, single-use, low-profile catheter that travels over our proprietary ViperWire guidewire.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	The systems use a saline infusion pump as a power supply for the operation of the catheter.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	Our ancillary products include the ViperSlide Lubricant and ViperTrack Radiopaque Tape.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	We also have an exclusive distribution agreement with Asahi to market its peripheral guide wire line in the United States.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	We assemble the single-use catheter with components purchased from third-party suppliers, as well as with components manufactured in-house.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	The infusion pump and guidewires are purchased from third-party suppliers.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses include compensation for executive, sales, marketing, finance, information technology, human resources and administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	Other significant expenses include travel and marketing costs and professional fees.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing, enhancement and regulatory approval of our products.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	Research and development expenses include employee compensation including stock-based compensation, supplies and materials, patent expenses, consulting expenses, travel and facilities overhead.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	We also incur significant expenses to operate clinical trials, including trial design, third-party fees, clinical site reimbursement, data management and travel expenses.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P15_S3	All research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Approved patent applications are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Interest and other, net primarily includes interest expense (including premium and discount amortization), interest income, change in the fair value of the debt conversion option, debt refinancing costs, and net write-offs upon debt conversion (option and unamortized premium or discount).
1180145_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Interest expense (including premium and discount amortization) results from outstanding debt balances and debt premiums and discounts.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	Interest income is attributed to interest earned on deposits in investments that consist of money market funds.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Change in Fair Value of Debt Conversion Option.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	Change in fair value of debt conversion option represents the period to period change in fair value of the debt conversion option associated with outstanding convertible debt.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	Net write-offs upon debt conversion are the result of the conversion of convertible debt, and include the write-off of the related debt conversion option and any unamortized debt premium or discount.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Other consists of miscellaneous non-operating expenses, including state taxes.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	We have established valuation allowances to fully offset our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty about our ability to generate the future taxable income necessary to realize these deferred assets, particularly in light of our historical losses.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	The future use of net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on us attaining profitable operations and will be limited in any one year under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 due to significant ownership changes (as defined in Section 382) resulting from our equity financings.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	At June 30, 2014 , we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax reporting purposes of approximately $159.2 million , which will expire at various dates through fiscal 2033.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect amounts reported in those statements.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	Our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, excess and obsolete inventory, the debt conversion option, and stock-based compensation are updated as appropriate at least quarterly.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	We use authoritative pronouncements, our technical accounting knowledge, cumulative business experience, valuation specialists, judgment and other factors in the selection and application of our accounting policies.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P24_S4	While we believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments that we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements are appropriate, these estimates, assumptions and judgments are subject to factors and uncertainties regarding their outcome.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P24_S5	Therefore, actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Some of our significant accounting policies require us to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	We sell the majority of our products via direct shipment to hospitals or office-based labs.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	We record estimated sales returns, discounts and rebates as a reduction of net sales.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period the revenue is recognized.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	Cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	This allowance is an estimate and is regularly evaluated for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience, credit quality of the customer base, age of the receivable balances, both individually and in the aggregate, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	Provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts attributed to bad debt are recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	We have inventories that are principally comprised of capitalized direct labor and manufacturing overhead, raw materials and components, and finished goods.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	Due to the technological nature of our products, there is a risk of obsolescence for changes in our technology and the market, which is impacted by technological developments and events.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	Accordingly, we write down our inventories as we become aware of any situation where the carrying amount exceeds the estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future demands and market conditions.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P30_S3	The evaluation includes analysis of inventory levels, expected product lives, product at risk of expiration, sales levels by product and projections of future sales demand.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	The fair value of the debt conversion option is related to the loan and security agreement with Partners for Growth ("PFG") and has been included as a component of debt conversion option and other assets on our balance sheet.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	The Monte Carlo option pricing model was used to determine the value of the debt conversion option and includes various inputs including historical volatility, stock price simulations, and the assessed behavior of us and PFG based on those simulations.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	In fiscal 2014, PFG converted all of the remaining loans (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information).
1180145_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	We have stock-based compensation plans, which includes stock options, nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	We determine the fair value of our option awards using option-pricing models.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	We determine the fair value of nonvested share awards with market conditions using the Monte Carlo simulation.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	Fair value of nonvested share awards that vest based upon performance or time conditions is determined by the closing market price of our stock on the date of grant, as determined by management and the board of directors.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	Stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period for the awards expected to vest.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Management's key assumptions are developed with input from independent third-party valuation advisors.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	In accordance with FASB guidance, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements related to legal proceedings when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	If a loss is possible, but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P36_S3	In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands), and, for certain line items, the changes between the specified periods:
1180145_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	Revenues increased by $32.7 million , or 31.5% , from $103.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2013 to $136.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2014 .
1180145_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	This increase was primarily attributable to a $24.2 million, or 26.5%, increase in the number of PAD Systems sold, which reflects a 30.8% increase in number of devices sold, partially offset by a 3.3% reduction in average selling prices.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	Additionally, the sale of the CAD System contributed approximately $5.0 million in revenues following our PMA approval in October 2013.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P38_S3	Other product revenue also increased $3.5 million , or 28.0% , during the year ended June 30, 2014 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2013 , primarily driven by increased sales of PAD and CAD Systems, which the products support.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P38_S4	Currently, all of our revenues are in the United States; however, we intend to sell internationally in the future and have commenced the process of seeking approval to do so in both Europe and Japan.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P38_S5	We expect our revenue to increase as we continue to increase the number of physicians using the devices, increase the usage per physician, introduce new and improved products, generate additional clinical data, continue the commercial launch of our CAD System, and expand into new geographies.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Cost of goods sold increased by $6.6 million, or 27.3% , from $24.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2013 to $31.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2014 .
1180145_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	These amounts represent the cost of materials, labor and overhead for single-use catheters, guidewires, control units, and other ancillary products.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	The increase was due to an increase in the quantities of products sold, partially offset by lower indirect costs per unit from higher production volumes and manufacturing efficiencies.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P39_S3	The increase in gross margin from 76.5% during the year ended June 30, 2013 , to 77.3% for the year ended June 30, 2014 , was primarily due to lower indirect costs per unit, partially offset by lower average selling prices of PAD Systems.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P39_S4	Cost of goods sold for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 includes $0.7 million and $0.4 million , respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P39_S5	We expect that gross margin in fiscal 2015 will improve slightly compared to fiscal 2014 as cost improvements will be made throughout the year.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	Quarterly fluctuations could occur based on production volumes, timing of new product introductions, sales mix, pricing changes, or other unanticipated circumstances.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses .
1180145_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $31.3 million , or 36.1% , from $86.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2013 to $118.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2014 .
1180145_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2014 have increased due to our commercial CAD System launch, the expansion of our sales and marketing organization, increased variable compensation, increased promotion and medical education programs, higher stock-based compensation, increased costs related to health care policy initiatives and higher medical device excise taxes.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P41_S3	Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 include $9.2 million and $6.2 million , respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P41_S4	We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as a result of the costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing organization and medical education and other programs to further commercialize our PAD products and expanding the commercial launch of our CAD System.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	Research and development expenses increased by $5.9 million , or 38.4% , from $15.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2013 to $21.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2014 .
1180145_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	Research and development expenses relate to the specific projects to develop new products or expand into new markets, such as the development of new versions of the PAD and CAD Systems, shaft designs, crown design, and PAD and CAD clinical studies.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	The increase primarily related to additional product development projects and clinical studies which began in fiscal 2014, and the related increase in headcount.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	Research and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 include $1.1 million and $0.8 million , respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P42_S4	As we continue to expand our product portfolio and clinical studies within the PAD and CAD markets, we generally expect to incur research and development expenses significantly above amounts incurred for the year ended June 30, 2014 .
1180145_14_ITEM7_P42_S5	Fluctuations could occur based on the number of projects and studies and the timing of expenditures.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Interest and other, net was $(1.8) million and $(1.6) million for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	The increase was primarily due to the change in fair value of the debt conversion option which was associated with the previously outstanding convertible debt (changes in fair value was primarily driven by the change in the market value of our common stock) and the write-off's associated with the debt conversions.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	Slightly offsetting this was a decrease in interest expense as a result of lower debt balances as well as debt premium and discount amortization.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	Net loss for the year ended June 30, 2014 was $(35.3) million , compared to $(24.0) million for the year ended June 30, 2013 .
1180145_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	Our net loss has increased as a result of increased operating expenses, partially offset by higher gross profit.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Revenues increased by $21.4 million, or 26.0%, from $82.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2012 to $103.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2013.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	This increase was primarily attributable to an $18.2 million, or 25.0%, increase in the number of PAD Systems sold, which reflects a 26.0% increase in the number of devices sold, partially offset by a 0.8% reduction in average selling prices.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	Other product revenue increased $3.2 million, or 33.6%, during the year ended June 30, 2013, compared to the year ended June 30, 2012, primarily driven by increased sales of PAD Systems, which the products support.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	Cost of goods sold increased by $5.2 million, or 26.9%, from $19.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2012 to $24.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2013.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	These amounts represent the cost of materials, labor and overhead for single-use catheters, guidewires, control units, pumps, and other supplemental products.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P46_S2	The decrease in gross margin from 76.7% during the year ended June 30, 2012, to 76.5% for the year ended June 30, 2013, was primarily due to a higher mix of Stealth 360 sales, which carried a higher unit cost than its predecessor product, and to lower average selling prices, partially offset by the favorable effect of increased production volumes.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P46_S3	Cost of goods sold for the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 includes $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $20.4 million, or 30.7%, from $66.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2012 to $86.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2013.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2013 increased due to increased variable compensation, expansion in our sales and marketing organizations, increased medical education programs, and the medical device excise tax, which became effective January 1, 2013 and resulted in an expense of $1.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2013.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 include $6.2 million and $4.4 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	Research and development expenses increased by $3.8 million, or 33.8%, from $11.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2012, to $15.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2013.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	Research and development expenses relate to the development of new products, enhancement of existing products and PAD and CAD clinical trials.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	The increase in clinical expenses was related to the advancement of the ORBIT II coronary trial and related expansion of the clinical organization.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P48_S3	Research and development expenses for the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 include $0.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Interest and other, net was $(1.6) million and $(2.3) million for the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	The decrease was primarily due to the change in fair value of the debt conversion option which was associated with the previously outstanding convertible debt and changes in its fair value were primarily driven by the change in the market value of our common stock.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	Slightly offsetting this was an increase in net write-offs upon conversion which were the result of the conversion of convertible debt and includes the write-off of the debt conversion option and any unamortized debt premium or discount.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Net loss for the year ended June 30, 2013 was $(24.0) million, compared to $(16.8) million for the year ended June 30, 2012.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	Our net loss increased as a result of increased operating expenses, partially offset by higher gross profit.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	To supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, our management uses a non-GAAP financial measure referred to as Adjusted EBITDA.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands):
1180145_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA of $7.2 million, or 51.3%, is primarily the result of the $11.1 million, or 49.4%, increase in the loss from operations.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	The loss from operations was significantly impacted by increases in operating expenses, slightly offset by an increase in gross profit.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Adjusted EBITDA was also impacted by an increase in stock-based compensation and increase in depreciation and amortization.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	Stock-based compensation increased $3.5 million, or 46.8%, from $7.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2013 to $10.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2014 .
1180145_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	Stock-based compensation increased as a result of vesting of previously granted share awards with a higher grant date fair value, and the granting of performance based restricted stock awards with shorter vesting periods than service based awards.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P53_S3	Depreciation and amortization increased as a result of additional investment in capital equipment and patents.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of performance and believe this measure facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by factoring out potential differences caused by non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expense.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA to analyze the underlying trends in our business, assess the performance of our core operations, establish operational goals and forecasts that are used to allocate resources and evaluate our performance period over period and in relation to our competitors operating results.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	We believe that presenting Adjusted EBITDA provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	We also believe that providing this information better enables our investors to understand our operating performance and evaluate the methodology used by our management to evaluate and measure such performance.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P55_S2	Adjusted EBITDA is also used to measure performance in our financial covenants as required by Silicon Valley Bank and Partners for Growth.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	The following is an explanation of each of the items that management excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and the reasons for excluding each of these individual items:
1180145_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP financial measures primarily because such expense, while constituting an ongoing and recurring expense, is not an expense that requires cash settlement.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	Our management also believes that excluding this item from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand its impact on our operational performance, liquidity and ability to make additional investments in the Company, and it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	We exclude depreciation and amortization expense from our non-GAAP financial measures primarily because such expenses, while constituting ongoing and recurring expenses, are not expenses that require cash settlement and are not used by our management to assess the core profitability of our business operations.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	Our management also believes that excluding these items from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand our operational performance, liquidity and ability to make additional investments in the Company.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	Some of the limitations associated with our use of these non-GAAP financial measures are:
1180145_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	Items such as stock-based compensation do not directly affect our cash flow position; however, such items reflect economic costs to us and are not reflected in our Adjusted EBITDA and therefore these non-GAAP measures do not reflect the full economic effect of these items.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore other companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	Our management exercises judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures we use.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily upon our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	We had cash and cash equivalents of $126.6 million and $67.9 million at June 30, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	During the year ended June 30, 2014 , net cash used in operations amounted to $26.8 million .
1180145_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	As of June 30, 2014 , we had an accumulated deficit of $238.6 million .
1180145_14_ITEM7_P64_S3	We have historically funded our operating losses primarily from the issuance of stock, convertible promissory notes, and debt.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	On March 29, 2010, we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank ("SVB").
1180145_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	The agreement was amended on December 27, 2011 to increase outstanding borrowings, amended on June 29, 2012 to modify financial covenants and reduce the interest rate and other fees, amended on May 10, 2013 to modify financial covenants and amended on June 26, 2014 to extend the line of credit to September 30, 2014 and reduce the interest rate.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	The agreement, as amended, includes a $12.0 million term loan and a $15.0 million line of credit.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P65_S3	The terms of each of these loans are as follows:
1180145_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	The $12.0 million term loan had an initial interest rate of 8.0% , which could have been reduced to 7.0% based on the achievement of positive EBITDA for the trailing six month period.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	The term loan had a maturity of 36 months , with repayment terms that included interest only payments during the first six months , followed by 30 equal principal payments of $400,000 plus interest, and a final payment of $100,000 due at maturity.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	This term loan also included an acceleration provision that required us to pay the entire outstanding balance, plus a penalty ranging from 1.0% to 3.0% of the commitment amount, upon prepayment or the occurrence and continuance of an event of default.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P66_S3	The balance outstanding on the term loan at June 30, 2014 and 2013 was $0 and $7.0 million , respectively, net of the unamortized discount associated with warrants issued to SVB in connection with the loan.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P66_S4	The unamortized discount associated with warrants and other fees paid to the lender were amortized over the 36 months maturity period.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P66_S5	See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P66_S6	The term loan expired on June 30, 2014.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	The $15.0 million line of credit expires on September 30, 2014 and has a floating interest rate equal to the Wall Street Journal's prime rate.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	Interest on borrowings is due monthly and the principal balance is due at maturity.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	Borrowings on the line of credit are based on 85% of eligible accounts.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P67_S3	Accounts receivable receipts are deposited into a lockbox account in the name of SVB.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P67_S4	The line of credit is subject to non-use fees, annual fees, and cancellation fees.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P67_S5	During the quarter ended December 31, 2013, we paid the remaining balance on the term loan with funds from the line of credit.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P67_S6	The balance outstanding on the line of credit at June 30, 2014 and 2013 was $2.4 million and $0 , respectively.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Borrowings from SVB are secured by all of our assets.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	The borrowings are subject to prepayment penalties and financial covenants, including maintaining certain liquidity and fixed charge coverage ratios.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of June 30, 2014 .
1180145_14_ITEM7_P68_S3	Any non-compliance by under the terms of debt arrangements could result in an event of default under the SVB loan, which, if not cured, could result in the acceleration of this debt.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	On April 14, 2010, we entered into a loan and security agreement with PFG, as amended on August 23, 2011, December 27, 2011, June 30, 2012 and May 10, 2013.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	The amended agreement provides that PFG will make loans to us up to $5.0 million .
1180145_14_ITEM7_P69_S2	The agreement has a maturity date of April 14, 2015.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P69_S3	The loans bear interest at a floating per annum rate equal to 2.75% above SVB's prime rate, and such interest is payable monthly.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P69_S4	The principal balance of and any accrued and unpaid interest on any notes are due on the maturity date and may not be prepaid at any time in whole or in part.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P69_S5	As of June 30, 2014, PFG had converted all remaining loans.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	At any time prior to the maturity date, PFG may at its option convert any outstanding loans into shares of our common stock at the applicable conversion price, which in each case equaled the ten -day volume weighted average price per share of our common stock prior to the issuance date of each note.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	We may also effect at any time a mandatory conversion of amounts, subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations provided in the agreement, including a requirement that the ten -day volume weighted average price of our common stock prior to the date of conversion is at least 15% greater than the conversion price.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	We may reduce the conversion price to a price that represents a 15% discount to the ten -day volume weighted average price of its common stock to satisfy this condition and effect a mandatory conversion.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P70_S3	We recorded an (expense) benefit of $(61,000) and $0.4 million for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 related to the change in fair value of the conversion options on all outstanding loans.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P70_S4	This amount is a component of interest and other, net on the accompanying statement of operations.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P70_S5	The balance outstanding under the loan and security agreement at June 30, 2014 and 2013 was $ 0 and $5.0 million, respectively, including the net unamortized premium.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P70_S6	The net unamortized premium associated with the loan, a beneficial conversion feature, and other fees paid to the lender was recorded as a component of interest and other, net on the accompanying statement of operations.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	During the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 , PFG converted various loans, in accordance with the conversion terms set forth in the agreement.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	The non-cash conversion activity was as follows (in thousands, except share amounts):
1180145_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	Upon conversion of the PFG loans, we recorded a noncash write-off of $252,000 and $400,000 of premiums related to the loans during the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	Any loans are secured by certain of our assets, and the agreement contains customary covenants limiting our ability to, among other things, incur debt or liens, make certain investments and loans, effect certain redemptions of and declare and pay certain dividends on its stock, permit or suffer certain change of control transactions, dispose of collateral, or change the nature of its business.

1180145_14_ITEM7_P73_S2	We were in compliance with all financial covenants at June 30, 2014 .
1180145_14_ITEM7_P73_S3	If we do not comply with the various covenants, PFG may, subject to various customary cure rights, decline to provide additional loans, require amortization of any future loan over its remaining term, or require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under any future loan and foreclose on any or all collateral, depending on which financial covenants are not maintained.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	We had the following registered underwritten public offerings:
1180145_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	(1) Proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses (in thousands).
1180145_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	We intend to use the net proceeds from the offerings for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not limited to:
1180145_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	repayment of indebtedness with Silicon Valley Bank.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	We may also use a portion of the net proceeds offering for the potential acquisition of businesses, technologies and products, although we have no current understandings, commitments or arrangements to do so.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to us from the offerings.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P79_S1	Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion over the use of these proceeds.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P79_S2	Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in investment-grade, interest-bearing securities.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	Cash and cash equivalents was $126.6 million and $67.9 million at June 30, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	The increase is primarily attributable to net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended June 30, 2014 , partially offset by net cash used in operating and investing activities and payments of long term debt.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	Net cash used in operating activities was $26.8 million , $10.8 million , and $11.3 million for the years ended June 30, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	For the years ended June 30, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , we had a net loss of $35.3 million , $24.0 million , and $16.8 million , respectively.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P81_S2	Changes in working capital accounts also contributed to the net cash used in the years ended June 30, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 .
1180145_14_ITEM7_P81_S3	Significant changes in working capital during these periods included:

1180145_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	Cash used in accounts receivable is due to higher receivable balances from revenue growth, which has grown in each of the last three fiscal years.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	Cash provided by (used in) inventories of $(6.6) million , $0.8 million , and $(1.2) million during the years ended June 30, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	Cash used by inventories in fiscal 2014 was due to higher levels of inventory for future sales growth, including the CAD System commercial launch, as well as timing of inventory purchases and sales.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P83_S2	Cash provided by (used in) inventories in fiscal 2013 and 2012 was primarily due to the timing of inventory purchases and sales.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	Cash provided by (used in) prepaid expenses and other current assets of $(0.6) million , $0.9 million , and $(0.4) million during the years ended June 30, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	Cash provided by (used in) prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to payment timing of vendor deposits and other expenditures.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	Cash provided by accounts payable of $4.6 million , $1.5 million , and $0.3 million during the years ended June 30, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	Cash provided by accounts payable was primarily due to timing of purchases and vendor payments and overall increased levels of expenses.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	Cash provided by accrued expenses and other liabilities of $4.5 million , $2.5 million , and $7,000 during the years ended June 30, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	Cash provided by accrued expenses and other liabilities for fiscal 2014 was primarily related to increased incentive compensation related to performance above goals, higher accrued commissions due to increased sales, and higher payroll related expenses related to headcount and timing of payments.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P86_S2	Cash provided by accrued expenses and other liabilities for fiscal 2013 and 2012 was primarily related to the timing and payment of accruals.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	Net cash used in investing activities was $13.4 million , $2.5 million , and $1.0 million for the years ended June 30, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	Cash used in investing activities resulted from investment in property, plant and equipment, and patents.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P87_S2	In fiscal 2014, we paid $11.1 million towards the construction of our new corporate headquarters, including a $9.1 million escrow deposit.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P87_S3	We expect the total cost of the building to be approximately $32 million.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	Net cash provided by financing activities was $99.0 million , $45.6 million , and $26.7 million during the years ended June 30, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively.

1180145_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	Cash used in financing activities in these periods included payments on long-term debt of $9.9 million , $4.8 million , and $1.9 million during the years ended June 30, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	Our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including the extent and duration of future operating losses, the level and timing of future sales and expenditures, the results and scope of ongoing research and product development programs, working capital required to support our sales growth, the receipt of and time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals, our sales and marketing programs, the continuing acceptance of our products in the marketplace, competing technologies and market and regulatory developments.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	As of June 30, 2014 , we believe our current cash and cash equivalents and available debt will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures (including the new corporate headquarters discussed below) and operations for the foreseeable future.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P90_S2	We intend to retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P90_S3	We may raise additional capital in the future, to fund acceleration of our current growth initiatives or additional growth opportunities, if we believe it will significantly enhance our value.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	On June 11, 2014, we entered into a Redevelopment Agreement, a Design-Build Contract, and a Development Services Agreement (as defined below) as well as various ancillary agreements related to the acquisition of real property located in New Brighton, Minnesota and the development of such property into our new corporate headquarters.

1180145_14_ITEM7_P93_S2	We anticipate that the total cost for the construction of the headquarters will be approximately $25 million, subject to certain increases or decreases if work is completed prior to or after March 1, 2015 or if changes are made to the project plans during construction.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P93_S3	We will pay Ryan a fee of 3.85% of the cost of the work.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P93_S4	We also anticipate that the total cost of furnishing, equipping and opening the headquarters will be approximately $7 million.

1180145_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	In connection with the agreements above, we were required to hold approximately $9.1 million in an escrow account which will be used to fund the final construction payments.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	The escrow is classified as construction in progress in property and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheet.

1180145_14_ITEM7_P101_S1	The amendments in ASU 2013-11 require us to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion thereof, as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss ("NOL") carryforward or a similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward, unless the uncertain tax position is not available to reduce, or would not be used to reduce, the NOL or carryforward under the tax law in the same jurisdiction; otherwise, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a gross liability and should not net the unrecognized tax benefit with a deferred tax asset.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P101_S2	ASU 2013-11 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2013 and should be applied to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist as of the effective date.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P101_S3	Companies may choose to apply this guidance retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	We do not anticipate a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue From Customers With Contracts.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P103_S1	The guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P103_S2	The guidance also requires expanded disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P103_S3	Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P104_S0	ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, using one of two prescribed retrospective methods.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P105_S0	We are evaluating the impact of the amended revenue recognition guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P106_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, " Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period" .
1180145_14_ITEM7_P106_S1	The guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period should be treated as a performance condition.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	ASU 2014-12 is effective for annual and interim periods within the annual period beginning after December 15, 2015.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P107_S1	We do not currently have share-based payment awards that fall within the scope of this standard and therefore we do not anticipate an impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
1180145_14_ITEM7_P108_S0	The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements.

1180145_14_ITEM7_P111_S3	Other than as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, even though our situation may change in the future.
1180145_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk or availability.
1180145_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	To achieve these objectives, our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of marketable securities, including money market funds, U.S. government securities, and certain bank obligations.
1180145_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2014 include liquid money market accounts.
1180145_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of changes in shareholders equity and comprehensive loss and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. at June 30, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P1_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1180145_14_ITEM8_P1_S2	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P1_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1180145_14_ITEM8_P1_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P1_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P1_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P1_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1180145_14_ITEM8_P8_S2	Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, CSI-MN continued after the merger as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Replidyne.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P8_S3	At the effective time of the merger, Replidyne changed its name to Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. ( CSI ) and CSI-MN merged with and into CSI, with CSI continuing after the merger as the surviving corporation.

1180145_14_ITEM8_P9_S2	In October 2013, the Company received premarket approval ( PMA ) from the FDA to market the Diamondback 360 Coronary Orbital Atherectomy System ( OAS ) as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P9_S3	The Company began a controlled commercial launch of the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS following receipt of PMA approval.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	The consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and comprehensive loss, and cash flows include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, after elimination of all intercompany transactions and accounts.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	The Company considers all money market funds and other investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.

1180145_14_ITEM8_P12_S1	Customer credit terms are established prior to shipment with the general standard being net 30 days.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P12_S2	Collateral or any other security to support payment of these receivables generally is not required.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P12_S3	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P12_S4	This allowance is an estimate and is regularly evaluated by the Company for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience, credit quality of the customer base, age of the receivable balances, both individually and in the aggregate, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P12_S5	Provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts attributed to bad debt are recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P12_S6	The following table shows the allowance for doubtful accounts activity (in thousands):
1180145_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method of valuation.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	The establishment of inventory allowances for excess and obsolete inventories is based on estimated exposure on specific inventory items.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	Property and equipment is carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of five years for production equipment and furniture and fixtures; three years for computer equipment and software; and the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term for leasehold improvements.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P15_S2	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs and minor renewals and betterments which do not extend or improve the life of the respective assets are expensed as incurred.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P15_S3	All other expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P15_S4	The assets and related depreciation accounts are adjusted for property retirements and disposals with the resulting gains or losses included in the consolidated statement of operations.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	The capitalized costs incurred to obtain patents are amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P16_S1	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	The recoverability of capitalized patent costs is dependent upon the Company s ability to derive revenue-producing products from such patents or the ultimate sale or licensing of such patent rights.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P17_S1	Patents that are abandoned are written off at the time of abandonment.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company regularly evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or that the remaining estimated useful life should be changed.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P19_S1	The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated by the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company leases manufacturing and office space under operating lease agreements.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P20_S1	One lease contains rent escalation clauses for which the lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P20_S2	Rent expense that is recognized but not yet paid is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

1180145_14_ITEM8_P21_S1	The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P21_S2	The Company records estimated sales returns, discounts and rebates as a reduction of net sales.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	Costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period the revenue is recognized.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P22_S1	Cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company provides its customers with the right to receive a replacement if a product is determined to be defective at the time of shipment.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P23_S1	Warranty reserve provisions are estimated based on Company experience, volume, and expected warranty claims.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P23_S2	Warranty reserve, provisions and claims were as follows (in thousands):
1180145_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	Developing a provision for income taxes, including the effective tax rate and the analysis of potential tax exposure items, if any, requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws, regulations and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P25_S1	The Company s judgment and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	Accounting guidance requires that accounting for uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in the financial statements.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P26_S1	The guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P26_S2	Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P26_S3	The guidance also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing, enhancement and regulatory approval of the Company s products.

1180145_14_ITEM8_P27_S3	Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	Approved patent applications are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years .
1180145_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P29_S1	The Company maintains its cash balances primarily with one financial institution.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P29_S2	These balances exceed federally insured limits.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P29_S3	The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in cash and cash equivalents.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	Under the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	The authoritative guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P31_S1	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	The categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	The hierarchy is broken down into three levels defined as follows:
1180145_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	The following table sets forth the fair value of the Company s financial instruments that were measured on a recurring basis (in thousands):
1180145_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	The fair value of the debt conversion option is related to the loan and security agreement with Partners for Growth III.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	L.P. ("PFG") (described in Note 3) and is included as a component of debt conversion option and other assets on the balance sheet.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P34_S2	The Monte Carlo option pricing model was used to determine the value of the debt conversion option and included various inputs such as expected volatility, stock price simulations, and assessed behavior of the Company and PFG based on those simulations.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P34_S3	Based upon these inputs, the Company determined the conversion option to be a Level 3 investment.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P34_S4	Significant increases (decreases) in any of these inputs in isolation would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	As of June 30, 2014, there was no balance for the debt conversion option asset as all of the associated convertible debt had been converted.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	As of June 30, 2014 , the Company believes that the carrying amounts of its other financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	The preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company has stock-based compensation plans, which includes stock options, nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P38_S1	Fair value of option awards is determined using option-pricing models, fair value of nonvested share awards with market conditions is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation, and fair value of nonvested share awards that vest based upon performance or time conditions is determined by the closing market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant, as determined by management and the board of directors.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P38_S2	Stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period for the awards expected to vest.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	The amendments in ASU 2013-11 require companies to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion thereof, as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss ("NOL") carryforward or a similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward, unless the uncertain tax position is not available to reduce, or would not be used to reduce, the NOL or carryforward under the tax law in the same jurisdiction; otherwise, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a gross liability and should not net the unrecognized tax benefit with a deferred tax asset.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P39_S2	ASU 2013-11 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2013 and should be applied to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist as of the effective date.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P39_S3	Companies may choose to apply this guidance retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented.

1180145_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	The guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1180145_14_ITEM8_P40_S2	The guidance also requires expanded disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

1180145_14_ITEM15_P46_S1	Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA Goals Receipt of cash incentive compensation for fiscal 2015 is based on the Company s achievement of revenue and adjusted EBITDA financial goals for fiscal 2015.

1180145_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	Management by Objective Targets The Bonus Plan also provides management by objective (MBO) targets related to certain predetermined milestones for fiscal 2015 relating to clinical studies and sales productivity.

1180145_14_ITEM15_P48_S3	Restricted stock grants vesting on total shareholder return and revenue growth provide the executive officer the opportunity to earn up to 200% of the target number of shares if performance goals are satisfied.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P49_S0	Stock Ownership Guidelines In connection with the approval of the fiscal 2015 executive officer compensation, the Board also established stock ownership guidelines for the officers, pursuant to which the officers are expected to acquire and hold the following amounts of the Company s common stock: - Chief Executive Officer: five times base salary - Executive Vice Presidents, Chief Officers, and Senior Vice Presidents: three times base salary - Vice Presidents: two times base salary New officers shall have five years from the date of appointment to reach this ownership level.

1180145_14_ITEM15_P51_S1	Directors may irrevocably elect, in advance of each fiscal year, to receive these fees in cash, in common stock of the Company or a combination thereof, or in restricted stock units ( RSUs ).
1180145_14_ITEM15_P51_S2	Each director electing to receive fees in RSUs shall at the time of such election also irrevocably select the date of settlement of the RSU.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P51_S3	On the settlement date, RSUs may be settled, at the Company s discretion, in cash or in shares of common stock or a combination thereof.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	An RSU award with a value of $125,000 payable, in the Company s discretion, in cash or in shares of common stock.

1180145_14_ITEM15_P54_S1	The Board has therefore established minimum stock ownership guidelines for non-employee directors which require each director to own Company common stock having a value of at least five times his or her annual cash retainer of $40,000.

1180145_14_ITEM15_P600_S1	MPCA has determined that an Environmental Covenant is needed for the Property because of the presence of a capped and closed landfill adjacent to the Property.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P600_S2	The adjacent closed landfill has the potential for on-going landfill gas generation.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P601_S0	A. Facts About the Release and Response Actions.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P602_S0	The Property was first developed for commercial and industrial uses in the 1960s.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P602_S1	A closed landfill, known as the Old Miller Dump, operated for several years in the mid-1960s and previously extended onto the eastern portion of the Property.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P602_S2	The Old Miller Dump is believed to contain primarily household garbage and demolition debris.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P603_S0	Environmental investigations of the Old Miller Dump determined that the concentrations of several metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) found in the dump materials exceed the MPCA s criteria for industrial land use known as the Tier 2 Industrial Soil Reference Values ( SRVs ).
1180145_14_ITEM15_P603_S1	Shallow groundwater near the Old Miller Dump was found to contain low levels of contaminants that are not adversely impacting nearby surface water receptors.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P604_S0	Soil gas surveys conducted at the Old Miller Dump indicated that landfill gases are being generated at the landfill and were migrating outward from the dump to nearby areas, including the Property.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P604_S1	Detailed information regarding soil, groundwater, and soil gas investigations are included in the following reports prepared by Barr Engineering Company ( Barr ) for the eastern portion of the Northwest Quadrant: February 2004 Phase II Summary Report, November 2005 Response Action Plan, and December 2006 Environmental Investigation Results and Updated Conceptual Response Action Plan.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P604_S2	These reports may be found in the files of the MPCA or the City, as defined below.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P605_S0	The City enrolled the Property in the MPCA s Voluntary Investigation and Cleanup Program ( VIC ) on January 21, 2004.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P605_S1	At the same time, the City also enrolled adjacent lands in the VIC program as part of the City s redevelopment of a larger area known as the New Brighton Exchange, f/k/a the Northwest Quadrant.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P605_S2	Barr submitted a Response Action Plan for the eastern portion of the Northwest Quadrant ( RAP ), which included the Property, in February 2008.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P605_S3	The MPCA approved the RAP with modifications on May 15, 2008.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P606_S0	The City implemented the RAP in a series of efforts from between 2008 to 2011.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P606_S1	All dump materials that had been located on the Property were excavated and removed from the Property.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P606_S2	The excavations were backfilled with clean soils.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P606_S3	Documentation sampling within the dump excavation limits at the Property met MPCA Residential SRVs within 12 feet of the final grade.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P606_S4	Soil sampling from within the remotely accessible zone (i.e., deeper than twelve feet below final grade) also met MPCA Tier 2 Industrial SRVs, with the exception of one test sample taken approximately 14 feet below final grade that showed a carcinogenic PAH concentration of 3.1 mg/kg, which is slightly greater than the MPCA Tier 2 Industrial SRV of 3.0 mg/kg for that compound.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P606_S5	The approximate location of this sample location is in the southeastern corner of the Property and is shown in Exhibit B .
1180145_14_ITEM15_P607_S0	A passive landfill gas collection system was installed over a majority of the consolidated dump footprint, as shown in Exhibit B .

1180145_14_ITEM15_P608_S0	In March 2009, Barr prepared a Contingency Action Plan for Landfill Gas Control in March 2009 for the eastern Northwest Quadrant ( CAP ), which was approved by the MPCA on April 28, 2009 with modifications.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P608_S1	The CAP describes the landfill gas monitoring and contingency actions following closure of the Old Miller Dump.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P608_S2	The City installed landfill vapor monitoring points along the dump perimeter in 2010, including two vapor monitoring points installed at the Property as shown on Exhibit B .
1180145_14_ITEM15_P608_S3	The City began periodic monitoring of the perimeter vapor monitoring points in October 2010.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P609_S0	Grantor installed one shallow groundwater well, designated MWT-07, at the Property in 2010 as shown on Exhibit B .
1180145_14_ITEM15_P609_S1	The results from four rounds of groundwater monitoring conducted from September 2010 through May 2011 did not identify concerns for the nearby surface water receptors.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P609_S2	Barr summarized the groundwater monitoring results in a report dated July 25, 2011.
1180145_14_ITEM15_P609_S3	The MPCA has approved the City s request to close and abandon the well at the Property.

1180145_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	In October 2013, we received premarket approval ( PMA ) from the FDA to market the CAD System as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P9_S3	We commenced a commercial launch that same month and as of June 30, 2015, over 9,000 CAD Systems have been sold to leading institutions across the United States.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P9_S4	Sales of CAD Systems during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 represented approximately 15% of revenue.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	In addition to the PAD and CAD Systems, we intend to expand our product portfolio through internal product development and establishment of business relationships with other medical device companies.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	We offer multiple accessory products designed to complement the use of the PAD and CAD Systems.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P10_S2	Sales of complementary products, primarily guide wire sales, represented 11% of revenue during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P10_S3	Included in this amount are revenues from our exclusive distribution agreement with Asahi to market its peripheral guide wire line in the United States, which expired in June 2015.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P10_S4	Sales of Asahi products were 4% of revenue during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	Peripheral arterial disease typically refers to the chronic obstruction of the arteries supplying the lower extremities due to plaque deposition on the walls of the arteries resulting in inadequate blood flow to the limbs.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	The anatomy of lower extremity arteries varies by location: arteries above the knee are generally long, straight and relatively wide compared to arteries below the knee, which tend to be shorter, more tortuous, and branch into progressively smaller in diameter arteries distally.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	The most common early symptoms of PAD are pain, cramping, or fatigue in the leg or hip muscles while walking, which typically subsides at rest.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	Symptoms may progress to include numbness, tingling or weakness in the leg and, in severe cases, burning or aching pain in the leg, foot, or toes while resting.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	As PAD progresses, additional signs and symptoms occur, including cooling or color changes in the skin of the legs or feet.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	If left untreated, PAD may continue to progress to Critical Limb Ischemia ( CLI ), a condition in which the amount of oxygenated blood being delivered to the limb is insufficient to keep the tissue alive.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	CLI may lead to large non-healing ulcers, infections, gangrene, limb amputation or death.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P14_S2	Within the first year of diagnosis, an estimated 25 to 30% of CLI patients will die and 30% will undergo amputation ( ACC/AHA 2005 Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Peripheral Arterial Disease, Hirsch et al, 2005).
1180145_15_ITEM1_P14_S3	CLI results in an estimated 160,000 amputations per year in the United States.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	According to estimates by the American Heart Association, as many as 8 to 12 million Americans have PAD.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	In addition, there are two other primary references used for estimating PAD prevalence: the patient Ankle Brachial Index ( ABI ) and the diabetes method.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	The most recent comprehensive study, based on ABI, estimates the U.S. prevalence at 8.5 million (Allison et al, Ethnic-Specific Prevalence of Peripheral Arterial Disease in the United States, Circulation, 2007).
1180145_15_ITEM1_P15_S3	Alternatively, a study by The SAGE Group, based on the diabetes method, estimated prevalence at 17.6 million in 2010 (The SAGE Group, The Diabetes Method, 2011).
1180145_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	to increase the prevalence of PAD.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	In many older PAD patients, particularly those with diabetes, PAD is characterized by fibrotic (moderately hard) or calcified (extremely hard) plaque deposits that can be very challenging to treat.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	Although we believe the rate of PAD diagnoses is increasing, we also believe that under-diagnosis continues, due to patients failing to display symptoms or physicians misinterpreting symptoms as normal aging.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	Emphasis on PAD education from industry, medical associations, insurance companies and other groups, coupled with publications in medical journals and public news channels, is increasing physician and patient awareness of PAD risk factors, symptoms, and treatment options.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association in 2011 lowered the recommended age for testing for PAD from 70 to 65, or 50 if the patient has a history of smoking or diabetes.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	As these guidelines are incorporated into physician practice, PAD diagnosis rates are forecasted to increase.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	Physicians manage a significant portion of the PAD diagnosed population by recommending lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, and by prescribing prescription drugs.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P19_S3	While medications, diet and exercise may improve blood flow, they do not treat the underlying obstructions created by calcium, and many patients have difficulty maintaining lifestyle changes.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P19_S4	As a result of these challenges, many medically managed patients develop more severe symptoms that require procedural intervention.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	Coronary arterial disease is a life-threatening condition and leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	CAD occurs when a fatty material called plaque builds up on the walls of arteries that supply blood to the heart.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	The plaque buildup causes the arteries to harden and narrow (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	The risk of CAD increases if a person has one or more of the following: high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, or family history of early heart disease.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	According to the American Heart Association, 15.4 million people in the United States suffer from CAD, the most common form of heart disease.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	Heart disease claims more than 600,000 lives in the United States each year.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	According to estimates, significant arterial calcium is present in nearly 40% of patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ).
1180145_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	Significant calcium contributes to poor outcomes and higher treatment costs in coronary interventions when traditional therapies are used, including a significantly higher occurrence of death and major adverse cardiac events ( MACE ).
1180145_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our OAS represents an innovative approach to the treatment of PAD and CAD that provides physicians and patients with a procedure that addresses many of the limitations of traditional treatment alternatives.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	The PAD Systems and CAD System devices are single-use catheters that incorporate a flexible drive shaft with an offset diamond-grit-coated crown.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	The peripheral device is often used as vessel prep to enable low pressure percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and drug coated balloons, and results in lower use of bail out stents.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P26_S2	The coronary device is used as vessel prep to facilitate stent delivery and prevent stent malposition.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P26_S3	Physicians position the crown at the site of a lesion containing arterial plaque and orbit the crown against it at high speeds to sand away the plaque and create a smooth lumen, or channel, in the vessel.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	The Peripheral OAS treats atherosclerotic soft plaque, which is harder than a normal vessel wall.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	The OAS are designed to differentiate between hard, diseased plaque and healthy, compliant arterial tissue, a concept that we refer to as differential sanding.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P27_S2	The diamond-grit-coated crown preferentially engages and sands the harder material, but is designed not to damage more compliant parts of the artery.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our OAS uses a single-use, low-profile catheter that travels over our proprietary guide wires and is powered by a saline infusion pumps that also helps cool the system and remove debris.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	The PAD Systems reduce plaque on peripheral vessel walls by using an orbiting, diamond-coated crown within peripheral arteries.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	Similarly, the CAD System uses the same method to reduce severely calcified plaque on coronary vessel walls within coronary arteries in order to facilitate stent delivery.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	The catheter for our OAS consists of:
1180145_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	a sheath, which covers the drive shaft and permits delivery of saline or medications to the treatment area.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	ViperWire Advance Guide Wire and ViperWire Advance Coronary Guide Wire.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	The ViperWire guide wires were designed to offer an improved ability to maneuver through tortuous, twisting blood vessels and cross challenging lesions.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	The OAS travels over this wire to the lesion and operate on this wire.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	ViperSlide is an exclusive lubricant designed to optimize the smooth operation of the OAS.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	The saline infusion pump mounts directly to the intravenous pole and bathes the OAS shaft and crown and provides an electric power supply for the operation of the catheter.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	The constant flow of saline, during orbit, reduces the risk of heat generation and improves the flush of particulates.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	The mechanism of action is a function of the centrifugal force generated by the OAS as it rotates and orbits inside the vessel.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	As the speed of the crown's rotation increases, centrifugal force increases the crown's radius of orbit and presses the diamond-grit-coated offset crown against the lesion or plaque, removing a small amount of plaque with each orbit.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P36_S2	The centrifugal force exerted onto the vessel wall decreases as the orbital radius increases, reducing the likelihood of adverse events during treatment.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	The characteristics of the orbit and the resulting lumen size can be adjusted by modifying the following two variables:
1180145_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	An increase in speed creates a larger orbital radius, thus accommodating larger diameter vessels.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our current PAD Systems allow the user to choose between three rotational speeds.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	Our CAD System allows the user to choose between two rotational speeds.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	The crowns for the OAS are designed with various weights (as determined by crown geometry and material density) and are coated with diamond grit.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	The PAD Systems crowns are available in three configurations: classic, micro and solid.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P40_S2	Physicians select crown sizes and configurations based on several case criteria, including reference vessel size, lesion length and degree of stenosis, stenosis morphology, and anatomy tortuosity.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P40_S3	Physicians often use the classic or micro crown configuration in small, more tortuous vessels or when less aggressive sanding is desired.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	The solid crown configuration is designed with a tapered, leading edge for frontal sanding, which can be used in tight calcified disease.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	The PAD Systems are available with a 1.50 millimeter and 2.00 millimeter classic crown, and a 1.25 millimeter, 1.50 millimeter and 2.00 millimeter solid crown configuration.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P41_S2	There is also a 1.25 millimeter micro crown available with the Diamondback 360 Peripheral device, which allows physicians options to treat very small arteries in the lower leg and foot.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P41_S3	Catheter lengths are 145 centimeters and 60 centimeters, which address procedural approach and target lesion locations both above and below the knee and ankle.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P41_S4	The shorter length catheters allow physicians an option to treat via retrograde pedal approach in addition to the common femoral artery access point.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P41_S5	By adjusting the speed in conjunction with crown selection, multiple lesions and vessel sizes can be treated.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	The crown for the CAD System is available in one configuration: 1.25 millimeter classic.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	As the crown moves outward, the centrifugal force is offset by the counterforce exerted by the arterial wall.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	Normal arteries are compliant and have the ability to expand and contract as needed to supply blood flow.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	If the tissue is compliant, it flexes away, rather than generating an opposing force that would allow the OAS to engage and sand the wall.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	Diseased tissue provides resistance and is able to generate an opposing force that allows the OAS to engage and sand the plaque.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	The sanded plaque is broken down into particles generally smaller than circulating red blood cells that are washed away downstream with the patient's natural blood flow.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	PAD System testing performed in carbon blocks, animal and cadaver models showed:
1180145_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	greater than 99% of particles were smaller than the lumen of the capillaries (which provide the connection between the arterial and venous system).
1180145_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	CAD System testing performed in a carbon block model showed:
1180145_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	The small particle size minimizes the risk of vascular bed overload, or a saturation of the peripheral or coronary vessels with large particles, which may cause slow or reduced blood flow.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	The small size of the particles allows them to be naturally cleared from the blood via various types of white blood cells and macrophages.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	We believe the OAS offer the following key benefits:
1180145_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	Differential Sanding Reduces Risk of Adverse Events .
1180145_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	The OAS is designed to differentiate between hard plaque and soft compliant arterial tissue.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	The diamond-grit-coated offset crown at the working end of the device engages and removes plaque from the artery wall with minimal likelihood of penetrating or damaging the fragile intima, or inner layer of the arterial wall because soft, compliant tissue flexes away from the crown.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P53_S1	Furthermore, the OAS has rarely penetrated the media (middle) or adventitial (outer) layers of the artery's wall.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P53_S2	The Diamondback 360 Peripheral's perforation rate was 0.7% during our pivotal CONFIRM trial.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P53_S3	Analysis by an independent pathology laboratory of more than 434 consecutive cross sections of porcine arteries treated with the Diamondback 360 Peripheral revealed there was minimal to no damage, on average, to the media or associated lamina, which implies preservation of the media during treatment.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P53_S4	Similarly, the perforation rate was 1.8% during our pivotal ORBIT II trial, with 0.9% perforations device related.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P53_S5	Analysis by an independent pathology laboratory of more than 443 patients enrolled in the ORBIT II Trial revealed 4 patients had a perforation after the OAS treatment and another 4 patients had a perforation after stent deployment, for a total of 8 perforations reported.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	The small size of the particles produced during sanding avoids the need for ancillary distal protection devices, commonly used with directional cutting atherectomy devices.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	The small particulate size also significantly reduces the risk of macroembolization, or larger pieces of removed plaque capable of blocking blood flow downstream.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	Allows Continuous Blood Flow During Procedure.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	The OAS allows for continuous blood flow while orbiting.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P55_S2	Other devices may restrict blood flow due to the size of the catheter required or the use of distal protection devices, which could result in complications such as excessive heat and tissue damage.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	Efficacy Demonstrated for Both PAD and CAD Systems.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	Our pivotal OASIS clinical trial was a prospective 20-center study that involved 124 patients with 201 lesions treated by the Diamondback 360 PAD System.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	Performance targets were established cooperatively with the FDA before the trial began.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P57_S2	Despite 55% of the lesions consisting of calcified plaque, the Diamondback 360 Peripheral successfully met the FDA's study endpoints.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P57_S3	Because the Predator 360 and Stealth 360 mechanism of action is identical to that of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral, no additional efficacy trials were required by the FDA for 510(k) clearance of either of those PAD Systems.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	For the CAD System, our ORBIT II coronary OAS trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OAS in treating severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	The trial met both the primary safety and efficacy endpoints by significant margins.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P58_S2	Preparation of severely calcified plaque with the OAS not only helped facilitate stent delivery, but also improved both acute and 30-day clinical outcomes compared with the outcomes of historic control subjects in this difficult-to-treat patient population.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	The pre-procedure mean minimal lumen diameter of 0.5 mm increased to 2.9 mm after the procedure.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	The primary safety endpoint was 89.6% freedom from 30-day MACE compared with the performance goal of 83%.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P59_S2	The primary efficacy endpoint (residual stenosis 50% post-stent without in-hospital major adverse cardiac events) was 88.9% compared with the performance goal of 82%.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P59_S3	Stent delivery was successful in 97.7% of cases; 50% stenosis was observed in 98.6% of subjects.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P59_S4	Low rates of in-hospital Q-wave myocardial infarction (0.7%), cardiac death (0.2%), and target vessel revascularization (0.7%) were reported.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	Treats Difficult, Fibrotic and Calcified Lesions.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	The OAS enables physicians to remove plaque from long, fibrotic, calcified or bifurcated lesions, as well as lesions with softer plaque, in peripheral arteries both above and below the knee.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	In the coronaries, the OAS enables physicians to treat complex, severely calcified lesions, enabling optimal stent placement in these difficult to treat lesions.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P61_S2	To date, the coronary OAS is the only FDA-approved device for treatment of severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	The orbiting action of the OAS removes the hard plaque in the artery by sanding.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	As the crown sands away the plaque, the lumen of the artery is opened and the vessel wall becomes more compliant.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P62_S2	The orbital motion and speed of the crown increases, thus allowing for continuous reduction of plaque as the opening of the lumen increases during the operation of the devices.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	The differential sanding of the OAS creates a smooth surface lumen, or channel, inside the vessel.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P63_S1	We believe that the smooth lumens created by the device increase the velocity of blood flow and decrease the resistance to blood flow, which may decrease the potential for restenosis, or renarrowing of the arteries.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	Physicians using the OAS employ techniques similar to those used in angioplasty, which are familiar to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists who are trained in endovascular techniques.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	The devices' simple user interfaces require minimal additional training.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	Single Access Site to Complete Treatment.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	The orbital technology and differential sanding process of the OAS allow for a single access site to treat multiple lesions, in most cases.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P65_S2	In the peripheral vasculature, the OAS device is capable of treating multiple lesions in multiple arteries through a single access site, thus reducing the need for multiple devices or the need for multiple access sites.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	Because the particles of plaque sanded away are of such small sizes, the OAS does not require a collection reservoir that needs to be repeatedly emptied or cleaned during the procedure, or add time and cost to the procedure.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	The unique OAS mechanism of action used in both the PAD and CAD Systems can be used to treat multiple anatomic locations.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	Below-the-Knee and Behind-the-Knee Peripheral Artery Disease.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	Arteries below and behind the knee are small in diameter and may be diffusely diseased, calcified or both.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P68_S2	Reaching and treating these small vessels requires a low profile which several competitive devices do not offer.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	Behind-the-knee, or popliteal, lesions also present challenges if a stent is used because stents frequently fracture in this area due to the forces exerted on the vessels when the knee bends or flexes.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P69_S1	The Diamondback 360 Peripheral is effective in treating those vessels, as demonstrated in our CALCIUM360 randomized clinical trial, where 100% of the lesions treated with the Diamondback 360 Peripheral were located below the knee.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P69_S2	The Diamondback 360 60cm Peripheral OAS offers a shorter shaft length, a smaller profile and a more flexible shaft than the predecessors for improved ease of use, and uses a 4 French catheter that enables physicians to access lesions below-the-knee using retrograde access (access through the ankle or foot).
1180145_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	Arteries above the knee are typically longer, straighter and wider than below-the-knee vessels.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	Plaque in these arteries may also be diffuse, fibrotic and calcific.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	Physicians often use higher speeds or larger crown sizes of our products to treat lesions above the knee.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	The individuals more at risk for being diagnosed with CAD are those that are suffering from high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, or have a family history of heart disease.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	Once CAD occurs, a fatty material called plaque builds up on the walls of arteries that supply blood to the heart.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	The plaque buildup causes the arteries to harden and narrow (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P73_S2	The CAD System is the only atherectomy device indicated for severe coronary calcium.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	The OAS has a short treatment time, typically less than two minutes.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	The OAS orbital mechanism of action allows one device to treat various diameter lumens inside the artery.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P75_S1	Adjusting the rotational speed of the crown changes the orbit to create the desired lumen diameter, thereby potentially avoiding the need to use multiple catheters of different sizes to treat multiple lesions.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	Single Access Site May Reduce Procedural Time Since the physician can treat multiple arteries through a single access site, this reduces the risk of bleeding complications that can occur during arterial access, ultimately reducing patient recovery time.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	Our goal is to be the leading provider of minimally invasive solutions for the treatment of peripheral and coronary disease.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P77_S1	The key elements of our strategy include:
1180145_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	Drive Adoption through Our Direct Sales Organization and Key Opinion Leaders.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P78_S1	We expect to continue to drive adoption of the OAS through our direct sales force in both hospital and office-based lab settings, which targets interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, and interventional radiologists.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P78_S2	As a key element of our strategy, we focus on educating physicians about the disease state and our clinical data, and training physicians on OAS technology through our direct sales force and through seminars where physician industry leaders discuss case studies and treatment techniques using the devices.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P79_S0	Collect Additional Clinical Evidence on Safety, Effectiveness and Economic Benefits of the OAS.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P79_S1	Physicians are increasingly requesting clinical study evidence to allow them to make treatment decisions to achieve the best possible short-term and long-term outcomes for their patients.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P79_S2	We are focused on collecting and using clinical evidence to demonstrate the advantages of the OAS and drive physician acceptance.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	Enhance OAS and Expand Product Portfolio within the Market for Treatment of Peripheral and Coronary Arteries.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P81_S0	In addition to enhancing the OAS, we have expanded our product portfolio.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P81_S1	We offer multiple accessory devices designed to complement the use of the OAS.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P81_S2	We are continuing product development to further expand our portfolio of PAD and CAD treatment solutions.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P82_S0	CE Mark was granted for the Stealth 360 device in October 2014, we expect CE Mark for the CAD System in fiscal 2016, and we also anticipate approval for the next generation coronary OAS device in Japan during the fiscal 2017 timeframe.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P82_S1	We are evaluating options for international expansion to maximize the coronary and peripheral market opportunities.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P82_S2	Sales channels will be based on specific country dynamics.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P82_S3	As a result, distributors, including potential strategic partners, and direct sales channels are being evaluated.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P83_S0	In addition to adding to our product portfolio through internal development efforts, we intend to continue to explore the acquisition of other product lines, technologies or companies that may leverage our sales force or complement our strategic objectives.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P83_S1	We also intend to explore distribution agreements, licensing transactions, and other strategic partnerships.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	Our healthcare policy initiatives goal is to raise awareness with public and private payors, along with key medical societies, of the clinical and economic issues associated with peripheral and coronary arterial calcium.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P84_S1	By educating payors and medical societies about the clinical advantages and cost effectiveness of our OAS technology, we believe we can sustain reimbursement coverage for our devices and ensure practice guidelines include appropriate treatment options for patients with arterial disease.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P85_S0	We continue to study the most challenging patient populations and are committed to providing relevant clinical evidence that enables physicians to select and utilize the best treatment options for their patients.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P85_S1	Our clinical studies incorporate rigorous long-term clinical and healthcare economic data that are critical to improving long-term patient care and ongoing healthcare changes.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P85_S2	Our studies in PAD and CAD illustrate the versatility of our technology and a focus on improving the standard of care.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P86_S0	We have conducted 14 clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the PAD Systems.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P86_S1	A total of 3,777 patients were enrolled in various studies including our PAD I and PAD II pilot studies, OASIS pivotal study, CONFIRM post market registries (CONFIRM I, II, and III), CALCIUM 360 , COMPLIANCE 360 , and multiple physician-initiated studies.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P86_S2	The results of these studies consistently demonstrate that the PAD Systems provide predictable, repeatable and durable results that differentiate them from other PAD treatments.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P87_S0	We recently completed follow-up on the CLARITY post market, randomized feasibility study and the TRUTH post market study.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P87_S1	The LIBERTY 360 study is still enrolling patients.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P87_S2	The following PAD clinical studies have been completed, are in process, or are being further analyzed:
1180145_15_ITEM1_P88_S0	In September 2005 our Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE ) was approved to begin OASIS, our pivotal U.S. study.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P88_S1	OASIS was a 124-patient, 20-center, prospective study that began enrollment in January 2006.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P88_S2	The primary efficacy study endpoint was absolute plaque reduction of the target lesions from baseline to immediately post-procedure.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P88_S3	The primary safety endpoint was the cumulative incidence of Serious Adverse Events ( SAE ) at 30 days.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P89_S0	In the OASIS study, 94.5% of lesions treated were behind or below the knee, an area where lesions have traditionally gone untreated until they require bypass surgery or amputation.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P89_S1	Of the lesions treated in OASIS, 55% were comprised of calcified plaque, which presents a challenge to proper expansion and apposition of balloons and stents, and 48% were diffuse, or greater than 3 cm in length.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P89_S2	Results of OASIS exceeded FDA pre-specified acceptance criteria with an overall plaque reductions of 59.4%, freedom from device related SAE of 95.2% and 90.3% overall, and freedom from TLR of 97.6%.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P90_S0	The CONFIRM series enrolled 3135 patients at over 200 U.S. institutions in order to evaluate the use of orbital atherectomy for the treatment of PAD.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P90_S1	The CONFIRM registry confirmed that orbital atherectomy was safe and effective in a large registry of all-comer patients.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P90_S2	Multiple sub-analyses have been performed and published on the CONFIRM series.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P90_S3	There were no safety or efficacy differences for patients treated in outpatient based labs versus hospitals.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P90_S4	The device was also found to be safe and effective for patients with diabetes or renal disease and in women and the elderly.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P91_S0	The study is a prospective, single-arm (non-randomized), post-market study that used intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) imaging and angiography to assess procedural outcomes in patients with symptomatic PAD and who are treated with the OAS and adjunctive balloon angioplasty.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P91_S1	An independent IVUS Core Lab was used to provide adjudicated analyses for IVUS outcomes.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P92_S0	TRUTH identified that the OAS can remove and modify calcified plaque.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P92_S1	IVUS results suggested that the OAS also polishes plaque surface and changes plaque shape.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P93_S0	This pilot study is designed to identify the clinically appropriate endpoint(s) of a possible larger, statistically powered pivotal trial for treatment of patients with CLI.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P94_S0	Enrolled patients had lesions of any morphology in vessels preventing direct blood perfusion to a foot wound.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P94_S1	The study utilized five core labs, IVUS, and Fractional Flow Reserve for significant clinical rigor.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P94_S2	CLARITY patients will be followed for one year.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P95_S0	We are currently enrolling up to 1,200 patients in our LIBERTY 360 clinical PAD study, which is a prospective, observational, multi-center clinical study to evaluate acute and long term clinical, quality of life and economic outcomes of various endovascular device intervention in patients with distal outflow PAD.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P95_S1	This study is a novel trial that studies patients with all endovascular PAD treatments and will increase the understanding of the clinical and economic outcomes of endovascular treatment for Claudicants and CLI patients with PAD.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P95_S2	Patients are currently enrolling into the LIBERTY 360 study and will be followed for up to five years.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P96_S0	CAD, the most common form of heart disease, continues to affect more patients worldwide.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P97_S0	Performing PCI on calcified lesions can lead to MACE rates as high as 24% at 30 days, stent malposition, and a number of procedural complications.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P98_S0	Despite being a relatively common problem, there had been no FDA IDE PMA trials studying only patients with severe coronary calcification, before our ORBIT I and ORBIT II trials.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P98_S1	We have completed our ORBIT I pilot study and recently published 5-year follow-up data and are completing 3-year follow-up on the pivotal ORBIT II IDE study.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P98_S2	We are also enrolling patients in the COAST trial.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P99_S0	The ORBIT I feasibility study evaluated performance of the Diamondback 360 for the treatment of de novo calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P99_S1	The ORBIT I study completed in India in 2009 enrolled 50 patients.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P99_S2	The endpoints were measured by device performance, MACE rate, and TLR at six months.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P99_S3	The freedom from MACE at 30 days and at 6 months was 94% and 92% respectively.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P99_S4	The 30-day and 6-month freedom from target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) was 98%.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P99_S5	Three-year and 5-year freedom from MACE was 81.8% and 78.8%, respectively.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P100_S0	In 2010, we began the ORBIT II pivotal study in the U.S, which evaluated the use of the CAD System in treating severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P100_S1	In October 2013, we received PMA from the FDA.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P101_S0	ORBIT II was mandated by the FDA to be conducted as a single-arm study without a comparator arm, as no other device was approved to treat severely calcified arteries.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P101_S1	One year ORBIT II study results were recently published in the American Journal of Cardiology.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P101_S2	The 1-year freedom from MACE was 83.6%, freedom from target lesion revascularization was 95.3%, and freedom from cardiac death was 97%.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P101_S3	The revascularization rate was significantly lower compared to historic controls.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P101_S4	We continue to expand our coronary clinical data with long term clinical and economic data demonstrating positive results for patients treated with the CAD System.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P101_S5	ORBIT II 2-year results and economic analysis were presented at the EuroPCR conference as a Late Breaking Clinical Trial in May 2015.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P101_S6	Results demonstrated a 2-year freedom from TLR/target vessel revasularization ( TVR ) rate of 91.9% and freedom from MACE rate of 80.6% in this difficult-to-treat patient population.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P101_S7	An economic analysis also demonstrated the cost of OAS would be fully covered by two years, with a possible extra $1,151 cost offset/savings per patient.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P102_S0	a total cost offset/savings of $4,946 per patient with OAS treatment, when accounting for shorter hospital stays for the index procedure.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P103_S0	This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, global study designed to evaluate performance of the next generation coronary product, the Diamondback 360 Coronary Micro Crown OAS.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P103_S1	We enrolled 100 subjects at 15 U.S. sites and five sites in Japan.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P103_S2	After approval, the Diamondback 360 Coronary Micro Crown OAS will be an additional tool for the treatment of challenging coronary lesions and be the basis for receiving regulatory approval to market the device in Japan.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P104_S0	Our clinical portfolio is expanding as we develop future studies to answer difficult questions about PAD and CAD treatment.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P104_S1	A number of upcoming clinical studies are in the development phase and will begin enrolling in the near future.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P104_S2	Our clinical research continues to highlight the safety and efficacy of the OAS and current and new research illustrates our versatility in the emerging vascular market.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P105_S0	We market and sell our products through a direct sales force in the United States.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P105_S1	Revenues for the PAD and CAD Systems for the years ended June 30, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 were $161.3 million , $120.4 million and $91.2 million , respectively.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P106_S0	We have targeted sales and marketing efforts to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists with experience using similar catheter-based procedures, such as angioplasty, stenting, and cutting or laser atherectomy.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P107_S0	Peer-to-peer education is also a key element of our sales strategy.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P108_S0	We target our marketing efforts to practitioners through physician education, medical conferences, seminars, peer-reviewed journals and marketing materials.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P108_S1	Our sales and marketing program focuses on:
1180145_15_ITEM1_P109_S0	developing relationships with key opinion leaders.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P110_S0	Our research and development efforts are focused in the development of products to penetrate our three key target markets: below and behind-the-knee, above-the-knee, and coronary vessels.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P110_S1	In additional to the key target markets, we also focus on alternative access sites.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P110_S2	Research and development projects include the development of new products, enhancement of existing products, and PAD and CAD clinical trials.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P110_S3	Research and development expenses for the years ended June 30, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 were $31.0 million , $21.1 million and $15.2 million , respectively.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P111_S0	We use internally-manufactured and externally-sourced components to manufacture the OAS.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P111_S1	Most of the externally-sourced components are available from multiple suppliers; however, certain key components, including the diamond-grit-coated crown and our ViperSlide Lubricant, are single sourced.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P111_S2	We have strategies and arrangements in place for procuring our key components from alternative suppliers in the event that one or more of our single source suppliers were to discontinue supplying us with a key component.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P111_S3	We assemble the shaft, crown and handle components on-site, and test, pack, seal and label the finished assembly before sending the packaged product to a contract sterilization facility.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P111_S4	Upon return from the sterilizer, the product is held in inventory prior to shipping to our customers.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P112_S0	We have effectively relocated into a new, 125,000-square-foot, corporate headquarters in Minnesota.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P112_S1	This custom-designed building has space for more than 500 employees and contains dedicated research and development, training and education, and manufacturing facilities.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P112_S2	The operations-dedicated space expands our production and inventory capacity significantly.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P112_S3	Depending on staffing, the new facility has the capacity to produce in excess of 75,000 devices per shift annually.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P112_S4	The finished goods storage has capacity for nearly 20,000 devices and more than 500 saline infusion pumps, as well as other accessory products.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P113_S0	Our Pearland, Texas facility is 46,000 square feet and includes a custom-built clean room and production space for future expansion of value-add processes, including machining and electronics assembly.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P113_S1	The facility, when it becomes fully staffed and equipped, will have the capacity to produce approximately 75,000 devices per shift annually.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P113_S2	This facility has finished goods storage capacity for greater than 15,000 OAS devices and other accessory products and over 500 saline infusion pumps.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P114_S0	We believe that, once the full transfer of operations is complete (anticipated to be complete by December 2015), our facilities in Minnesota and Texas will be adequate for the foreseeable future.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P115_S0	We are registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P115_S1	We have opted to maintain quality assurance and quality management certifications to enable us to market our products in the member states of the European Union, the European Free Trade Association and countries that have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements with the European Union.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P115_S2	We are ISO 13485:2003 certified, and our renewal is due by December 2015.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P115_S3	Under these registrations, our plants are audited by the FDA and our Notified Body for the EU CE Mark.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P115_S4	Our Stealth 360 has received CE Mark.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P116_S0	Third-party payors, including private insurers, and government insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, pay for a significant portion of patient care provided in the United States.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P116_S1	The single largest payor in the United States is the Medicare program, a federal governmental health insurance program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ).
1180145_15_ITEM1_P116_S2	Medicare covers certain medical care expenses for eligible elderly and disabled individuals, including a large percentage of the population with PAD and CAD who could be treated with the OAS.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P116_S3	In addition, private insurers often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P116_S4	Consequently, Medicare's coverage and reimbursement policies are important to our operations.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P117_S0	CMS has established Medicare reimbursement codes describing atherectomy products and procedures using atherectomy products.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P117_S1	We believe that physicians and hospitals that treat PAD and CAD with the respective OAS will generally be eligible to receive reimbursement from Medicare, as well as private insurers, for the cost of the single-use catheter and the physician's services.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P118_S0	The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P118_S1	Our OAS competes with a variety of other products or devices for the treatment of vascular disease, including stents, balloon angioplasty catheters and atherectomy catheters, as well as products used in vascular surgery.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P118_S2	Large competitors in the stent and balloon angioplasty market segments include Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific, Cook Medical, Johnson Johnson, BARD, and Medtronic.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P118_S3	We also compete against manufacturers of atherectomy catheters including, among others, Medtronic, Spectranetics, Boston Scientific and Philips, as well as manufacturers that may enter the market due to the increasing demand for treatment of vascular disease.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P118_S4	Other competitors include pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs for the treatment of PAD and CAD and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral and coronary bypass procedures.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P118_S5	We are not aware of any competing catheter systems either currently on the market or in development that also use an orbital motion to create lumens larger than the catheter itself.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P119_S0	Because of the size of the peripheral opportunities, competitors and potential competitors have historically dedicated significant resources to aggressively promote their products.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P119_S1	We believe that our PAD and CAD Systems compete primarily on the basis of:
1180145_15_ITEM1_P120_S0	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and other intellectual property laws, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P120_S1	As of June 2015, we held 46 issued U.S. patents and have 39 U.S. patent applications pending, as well as 203 issued or granted foreign patents and 148 foreign patent applications, each of which corresponds to aspects of our U.S. patents and applications.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P120_S2	Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2015 and 2032, and our most important patents, U.S. Patent No. 6,494,890 and two key design patents covering our eccentric abrasive crown technology are due to expire on June 1, 2019, February 16, 2024 and December 29, 2023, respectively, though we will pursue patent term extensions on the basis of regulatory delay where appropriate.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P121_S0	Our issued patents and patent applications relate primarily to the design and operation of interventional atherectomy devices, including the PAD and CAD Systems.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P121_S1	These patents and applications include claims covering key aspects of orbital atherectomy devices, including the design, manufacture and therapeutic use of certain atherectomy abrasive heads, drive shafts, control systems, handles and couplings.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P121_S2	As we continue to research and develop our atherectomy technology, we intend to file additional U.S. and foreign patent applications related to the design, manufacture and therapeutic uses of atherectomy devices.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P121_S3	In addition, we hold 18 registered U.S. trademarks, 12 registered marks in the Madrid Protocol with protection granted within at least one of Australia, Europe, China, Japan and Mexico, six registered marks in Europe, five registered marks in Canada, five registered marks in Mexico, and eight registered marks in Hong Kong.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P121_S4	We have three trademark applications pending in the U.S., eight trademark applications pending in Canada and 12 trademark applications pending in India.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P122_S0	We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P122_S1	We seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P122_S2	Agreements with our employees also forbid them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P122_S3	We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P123_S0	Governmental authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local levels and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of medical devices such as the PAD and CAD Systems.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P124_S0	Failure to obtain approval to market our products under development and to meet the ongoing requirements of these regulatory authorities could prevent us from marketing and continuing to market our products.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P125_S0	The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( FDCA ) and the FDA s implementing regulations govern medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post market surveillance.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P125_S1	Medical devices and their manufacturers are also subject to inspection by the FDA.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P125_S2	The FDCA, supplemented by other federal and state laws, also provides civil and criminal penalties for violations of its provisions.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P126_S0	We manufacture and market medical devices that are regulated by the FDA, comparable state agencies and regulatory bodies in other countries.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P127_S0	Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P128_S0	The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization are premarket notification (also called 510(k) clearance) and PMA.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P129_S0	The type of marketing authorization applicable to a device - 510(k) clearance or PMA - is generally linked to classification of the device.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P130_S0	The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the extent of control deemed necessary to ensure the device s safety and effectiveness.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P130_S1	Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P130_S2	Class I devices are deemed to pose the least risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling, premarket notification, and adherence to the FDA s current good manufacturing practice requirements, as reflected in its Quality System Regulation ( QSR ).
1180145_15_ITEM1_P130_S3	Class II devices are intermediate risk devices that are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post market surveillance.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P130_S4	Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, and include life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, and devices not substantially equivalent to a device that is already legally marketed.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P131_S0	Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from FDA.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P131_S1	Class I and Class II devices that have not been so exempted are eligible for marketing through the 510(k) clearance pathway.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P131_S2	By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require PMA prior to commercial marketing.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P131_S3	The PMA process is generally more stringent, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) clearance process.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P132_S0	To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device legally marketed in the United States.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P132_S1	A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P132_S2	A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P133_S0	Generally, the 510(k) clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a year or more.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P134_S0	After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA (if the device as modified is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device).
1180145_15_ITEM1_P134_S1	The determination as to whether new authorization is needed is initially left to the manufacturer; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P134_S2	The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P135_S0	We received 510(k) clearance for use of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral as a therapy in patients with PAD in the United States on August 22, 2007.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P135_S1	We received additional 510(k) clearances for the control unit used with the Diamondback 360 Peripheral on October 25, 2007 and for the solid crown version of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral on November 9, 2007.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P135_S2	We were granted 510(k) clearance of the Predator 360 in March 2009 and Stealth 360 in March 2011.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P135_S3	We received 510(k) clearance of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral 1.25 Micro OAS in November 2013 and the Diamondback 360 Peripheral 60cm OAS in March 2014.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P135_S4	The Diamondback 360 Peripheral 1.25 Solid OAS was cleared in April 2015.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P135_S5	We received clearance of the ViperWire Advance Flex Tip Guide Wire in June 2015.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P136_S0	A PMA application requires the payment of significant user fees and must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P136_S1	A PMA application must also include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P137_S0	After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P137_S1	During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P137_S2	Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P137_S3	In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with the FDA s QSR which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P138_S0	FDA review of a PMA application is required by statute to take no longer than 180 days, although the process typically takes significantly longer, and may require several years to complete.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P138_S1	The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
1180145_15_ITEM1_P139_S0	changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P140_S0	If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P140_S1	When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P140_S2	If the FDA s evaluation of the PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny PMA or issue a not approvable letter.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P140_S3	The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA application.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P140_S4	Even if a PMA application is approved, the FDA may approve the device with an indication that is narrower or more limited than originally sought.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P140_S5	The agency can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of the device as a condition of approval, or impose post approval requirements such as continuing evaluation and periodic reporting on the safety, efficacy and reliability of the device for its intended use.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P141_S0	New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P141_S1	PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P142_S0	The FDA granted unconditional IDE approval in April 2010 to begin the ORBIT II coronary trial in the United States.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P142_S1	This pivotal trial was set up in two phases:
1180145_15_ITEM1_P142_S2	Phase I allowed us to enroll up to 100 patients at as many as 50 U.S. sites, and Phase II allowed us to expand the trial to the full complement of 429 patients.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P142_S3	In May 2011, we received approval from the FDA to complete enrollment of 429 patients in our ORBIT II clinical trial for a coronary application for the Diamondback 360, which followed the FDA s review of data from the first 50 cases in the ORBIT II trial.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P142_S4	In July 2012, we received approval from the FDA to include the new electric coronary device (similar to Stealth 360 technology used in PAD and customized specifically for the coronary application), which improves ease of use.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P142_S5	The FDA required 100 enrollments with the new electric coronary device and would have allowed up to 50 additional patients in the trial, as needed, to achieve that enrollment level.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P142_S6	A total of 443 patients were enrolled in the trial.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P143_S0	In March 2013, we completed submission of our PMA application to the FDA for our OAS to treat calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P143_S1	In October 2013, we received PMA from the FDA to market the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P143_S2	We commenced a controlled commercial launch of the CAD System following receipt of PMA.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P143_S3	In 2014, we initiated the COAST study, an IDE clinical trial, to evaluate a modified design of the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P144_S0	Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P144_S1	These trials generally require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P144_S2	The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P144_S3	The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P144_S4	Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P145_S0	FDA approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P145_S1	With certain exceptions, changes made to an investigational plan after an IDE is approved must be submitted in an IDE supplement and approved by FDA (and by governing institutional review boards when appropriate) prior to implementation.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P146_S0	All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with regulations and requirements collectively known as good clinical practice.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P146_S1	Good clinical practices include the FDA s IDE regulations, which describe the conduct of clinical trials with medical devices, including the recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of sponsors and investigators, and labeling of investigational devices.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P146_S2	They also prohibit promotion, test marketing or commercialization of an investigational device and any representation that such a device is safe or effective for the purposes being investigated.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P146_S3	Good clinical practices also include the FDA s regulations for institutional review board approval and for protection of human subjects (such as informed consent), as well as disclosure of financial interests by clinical investigators.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P147_S0	Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P147_S1	The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P147_S2	The commencement or completion of any clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application or clearance of a premarket notification for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:
1180145_15_ITEM1_P148_S0	the FDA concludes that the trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P149_S0	After a device is cleared or approved for use and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P150_S0	product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device that may present a risk to health.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P151_S0	In addition, the FDA may require a company to conduct post market surveillance studies or order it to establish and maintain a system for tracking its products through the chain of distribution to the patient level.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P152_S0	Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions:
1180145_15_ITEM1_P153_S0	We and our contract manufacturers, specification developers and suppliers are also required to manufacture our products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements set forth in the QSR.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P154_S0	The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing and record keeping.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P154_S1	The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P154_S2	If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers is not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to clear or approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P154_S3	Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P155_S0	Our operations are directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the FDCA, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P155_S1	These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, education and clinical programs.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P155_S2	In addition, these laws require us to screen individuals and other companies, suppliers and vendors in order to ensure that they are not debarred by the federal government and, therefore, prohibited from doing business in the healthcare industry.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P156_S0	The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P156_S1	Several courts have interpreted the statute s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P157_S0	The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P157_S1	Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P158_S0	The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P158_S1	Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P159_S0	In addition to the laws described above, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P160_S0	The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P160_S1	The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P161_S0	On May 8, 2014, we received a letter from the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Western District of North Carolina stating that it is investigating the Company to determine whether we had violated the False Claims Act.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P161_S1	The letter enclosed a Civil Investigative Demand for written interrogatories and document requests.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P161_S2	See Item 3 of this Form 10-K for additional information on this matter.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P162_S0	The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, and certain state laws require persons to collect and report certain data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P162_S1	It is widely anticipated that public reporting under the Sunshine Act and implementing Open Payment regulations will result in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P163_S0	Voluntary industry codes, federal guidance documents and a variety of state laws address the tracking and reporting of marketing practices relative to gifts given and other expenditures made to doctors and other healthcare professionals.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P163_S1	In addition to impacting our marketing and educational programs, our internal business processes are and will continue to be affected by the numerous legal requirements and regulatory guidance at the state, federal and industry levels.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P164_S0	International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P164_S1	The time required to obtain approval in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P164_S2	For example, the primary regulatory environment in Europe with respect to medical devices is that of the European Union, which includes most of the major countries in Europe.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P164_S3	Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P165_S0	The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P165_S1	Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the European Union, although actual implementation of these directives may vary on a country-by-country basis.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P166_S0	The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of submission of a design dossier, self-assessment by the manufacturer, a third-party assessment, and review of the design dossier by a Notified Body.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P166_S1	This third-party assessment generally consists of an audit of the manufacturer s quality system and manufacturing site, as well as review of the technical documentation used to support application of the CE Mark to one s product and possibly specific testing of the manufacturer s product.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P167_S0	An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the European Union is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P168_S0	In addition, any international expansion, operations and sales that we undertake will require us to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions and with U.S. and foreign export control, trade embargo and custom laws.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P169_S0	Our operations are subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P169_S1	We are currently classified and licensed as a Very Small Quantity Hazardous Waste Generator within Ramsey County, Minnesota.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P169_S2	There are no regulated wastes requiring licensing in our Texas facility.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P170_S0	As of June 30, 2015 , we had 597 employees, including 134 employees in manufacturing, 284 employees in sales, 38 employees in marketing, 40 employees in clinical, 59 employees in general and administrative, and 42 employees in research and development, all of which are full-time employees.
1180145_15_ITEM1_P170_S1	None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We have a history of net losses and a short commercialization experience, and we are likely to continue to incur losses.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We are not profitable and have incurred net losses in each fiscal year since our formation in 1989.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In particular, we had net losses of $ 32.8 million , $35.3 million , and $24.0 million for the years ended June 30, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	As of June 30, 2015 , we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $271.4 million .
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	We commenced commercial sales of the PAD Systems in September 2007 and the CAD System in October 2013, and our short commercialization experience makes it difficult for us to predict future performance.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P1_S4	We also expect to incur significant additional expenses for sales and marketing, research and development, and manufacturing as we continue to commercialize the PAD and CAD Systems and additional expenses as we seek to develop and commercialize future versions of the PAD and CAD Systems and any future products.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Additionally, we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as our business grows.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P1_S6	As a result, our operating losses are likely to continue.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We may be unable to sustain our revenue growth.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our revenue has grown in each of the fiscal years since we commenced commercial sales of the PAD Systems in September 2007.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our ability to continue to increase our revenues in future periods will depend on our ability to increase sales of the PAD Systems and generate significant sales from the CAD System and new and improved products we introduce, which will, in turn, depend in part on our success in growing our customer base and reorders from those customers.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We may not be able to generate, sustain or increase revenues on a quarterly or annual basis.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	If we cannot achieve or sustain revenue growth for an extended period, our financial results will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Economic conditions may adversely affect our business.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Adverse worldwide economic conditions may negatively impact our business.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	A significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of our customers could cause unfavorable trends in their purchases and also in our receivable collections and additional allowances may be required, which could adversely affect our operating results.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Adverse worldwide economic conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers' ability to provide us with materials and components, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The PAD Systems, the CAD System and future products may never achieve broad market acceptance.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The PAD and CAD Systems and future products we may develop may never gain broad market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The degree of market acceptance of any of our products will depend on a number of factors, including:
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	the level of education and awareness among physicians and hospitals concerning our products.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Failure of the PAD and CAD Systems to significantly penetrate current or new markets would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our customers may not be able to achieve adequate reimbursement for using the PAD and CAD Systems, which could affect the acceptance of our products and cause our business to suffer.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved medical devices and procedures is uncertain.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The commercial success of our products is substantially dependent on whether third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement for the use of such products and related services are available.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We expect our products to continue to be purchased by hospitals and other providers who will then seek reimbursement from various public and private third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers, for the services provided to patients.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	While third-party payors are currently providing reimbursement for our products, we can give no assurance that these third-party payors will continue to provide adequate reimbursement for use of the PAD and CAD Systems to permit hospitals and doctors to consider the products cost-effective for patients requiring treatment, or that current reimbursement levels for our products will continue.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P11_S4	In addition, the overall amount of reimbursement available for PAD and CAD treatment could decrease in the future.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain sufficient reimbursement could cause our business to suffer.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement, and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for use of our products.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In order to position our products for acceptance by third-party payors, we may have to agree to lower prices than we might otherwise charge.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Governmental and private sector payors have instituted initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs using, for example, price regulation or controls and competitive pricing programs.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Some third-party payors also require demonstrated superiority, on the basis of randomized clinical trials, or pre-approval of coverage, for new or innovative devices or procedures before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such devices or procedures.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	It is uncertain whether our current products or any future products we may develop will be viewed as sufficiently cost-effective to warrant adequate coverage and reimbursement levels.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products is limited or not available, the acceptance of our products and, consequently, our business will be substantially harmed.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Healthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	There have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control healthcare costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system, some of which have been enacted into law, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Patient Act.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The Patient Act and any additional healthcare proposals and laws that may be enacted in the future could also limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The Patient Act and future healthcare legislation could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our financial performance may be adversely affected by medical device tax provisions in the health care reform legislation.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The imposition of the 2.3% medical device excise tax enacted as part of the Patient Act has adversely affected our financial results and has required, and will continue to require, us to identify ways to reduce spending in other areas or raise additional capital to offset the increased expense.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We have not been able to pass along the cost of the tax to our customers or offset the cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting from the expansion of health insurance coverage and do not expect to be able to do so in the future.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Ongoing implementation of this legislation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We have limited data and experience regarding the safety and efficacy of the PAD and CAD Systems.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Any long-term data that is generated may not be positive or consistent with our limited short-term data, which would affect market acceptance of these products.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Because our technology is relatively new in the treatment of PAD and CAD, we have performed clinical trials only with limited patient populations.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The long-term effects of using the PAD and CAD Systems in a large number of patients have not been studied and the results of short-term clinical use of the PAD or CAD Systems do not necessarily predict long-term clinical benefits or reveal long-term adverse effects.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We are conducting and developing several clinical trials, and there are substantial risks and uncertainties involved in these trials.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We must devote substantial resources to our clinical trials, clinical trials often take several years to develop and conduct, there are difficulties involved in locating sites and patients to participate in our clinical trials, and the results of every trial are uncertain until the trial is completed.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	These uncertainties could adversely impact our financial results, our reputation and the reputation of our products.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Clinical trials conducted with the PAD and CAD Systems have involved procedures performed by physicians who are very technically proficient.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Consequently, both short and long-term results reported in these studies may be significantly more favorable than typical results achieved by physicians, which could negatively impact market acceptance of the PAD and CAD Systems and materially harm our business.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We face significant competition, must innovate to stay competitive, and may be unable to sell the PAD or CAD Systems at profitable levels.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The market for medical devices is highly competitive, dynamic and marked by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovation.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our ability to compete depends on our ability to innovate successfully, and, while certain barriers exist to entry into our market, we cannot assure that new entrants or existing competitors will not be able to develop products that compete directly with our products.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We compete against very large and well-known stent and balloon angioplasty device manufacturers, atherectomy catheter manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral and coronary bypass procedures.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	We may have difficulty competing effectively with these competitors because of their well-established positions in the marketplace, significant financial and human capital resources, established reputations and worldwide distribution channels.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	develop more effective or less expensive products or technologies that render our technology or products obsolete or non-competitive.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We have encountered and expect to continue to encounter potential customers who, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to or prefer the products offered by these competitors.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	If we are unable to compete successfully, our revenue will suffer.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Increased competition might lead to price reductions and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Competitive pressures may decrease the demand for our products and could adversely affect our financial results.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We have limited commercial manufacturing experience and could experience difficulty in producing the PAD and CAD Systems or may need to depend on third parties to manufacture the products.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We have limited experience in commercially manufacturing the PAD Systems, even less experience in commercially manufacturing the CAD System and no experience manufacturing these products in the volume that we anticipate will be required if we achieve planned levels of commercial sales.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	As a result, we may not be able to develop and implement efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to manufacture the PAD and CAD Systems or future products in significant volumes, while meeting the legal, regulatory, quality, price, durability, engineering, design and production standards required to market our products successfully.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The forecasts of demand we use to determine order quantities and lead times for components purchased from outside suppliers may be incorrect.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our failure to obtain required components or subassemblies when needed and at a reasonable cost would adversely affect our business.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In addition, we may in the future need to depend upon third parties to manufacture the PAD and CAD Systems and future products.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Any difficulties in locating and hiring third-party manufacturers, or in the ability of third-party manufacturers to supply quantities of our products at the times and in the quantities we need, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We depend upon third-party suppliers, including single source suppliers to us and our customers, making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We rely on third-party suppliers to provide us with certain components of our products and to provide key components or supplies to our customers for use with our products.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We rely on single source suppliers for certain components of the PAD and CAD Systems.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	We depend on our suppliers to provide us and our customers with materials in a timely manner that meet our and their quality, quantity and cost requirements.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P32_S3	These suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand and our customers' demands.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Any supply interruption from our suppliers or failure to obtain additional suppliers for any of the components used in our products would limit our ability to manufacture our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We have increased the size of our organization and expect to continue to do so, and we may experience difficulties managing growth.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business, our future revenue and operating results may be adversely affected.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	During the year ended June 30, 2015, we expanded the size of our organization, particularly in the number of sales and marketing personnel, and we plan to continue this growth.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	The growth we may experience in the future may provide challenges to our organization, requiring us to also rapidly expand other aspects of our business, including our manufacturing operations.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Rapid expansion in personnel may result in less experienced people producing and selling our products, which could result in unanticipated costs and disruptions to our operations.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P35_S3	If we cannot scale and manage our business appropriately, our anticipated growth may be impaired and our financial results will suffer.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We intend to sell our products internationally in the future, but we may experience difficulties in obtaining approval to do so or in successfully marketing our products internationally even if approved.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Currently, all of our revenues are in the United States; however, we intend to sell internationally in the future and have commenced the process of seeking approval to do so in both Europe and Japan.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	There can be no guarantee that we will receive approval to sell our products internationally, nor can there be any guarantee that any sales would result even if such approval is received.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In addition, we will incur substantial expenses in connection with international expansion.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Our inability to successfully enter international markets and manage business on a global scale could negatively affect our financial results.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We may require additional financing, and our failure to obtain additional financing when needed could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We may be dependent on additional financing to execute our business plan.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P39_S2	In the event we need or desire additional financing, we may be unable to obtain it by borrowing money in the credit markets or raising money in the capital markets.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P39_S3	If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, we may terminate or delay the development of one or more of our products, or delay establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We are dependent on our senior management team and highly skilled personnel, and our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain personnel necessary for our success.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We are highly dependent on our senior management and other key personnel.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Our success will depend on our ability to retain senior management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, including sales and marketing professionals, scientists, clinical specialists, engineers and other highly skilled personnel and to integrate current and additional personnel in all departments.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	The loss of members of our senior management, sales and marketing professionals, scientists, clinical and regulatory specialists and engineers could prevent us from achieving our objectives of continuing to grow our company.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P41_S3	We do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our stock price is volatile and subject to significant fluctuations.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Market prices for securities of early-stage pharmaceutical, medical device, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Our common stock traded as low as $23.15 and as high as $41.28 per share during the 12-month period ended June 30, 2015 .
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Moreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by 5-percent shareholders that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We may have experienced an ownership change in the past and we may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock, some of which may be outside our control.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P49_S1	As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards or other pre-change tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitations.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our ability to market the PAD Systems in the United States is limited to use as a therapy in patients with PAD and our ability to market the CAD System in the United States is limited to use as a therapy in patients with severely calcified CAD, and if we want to expand our marketing claims, we will need to file for additional FDA clearances or approvals and conduct further clinical trials, which would be expensive and time consuming and may not be successful.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The PAD Systems received FDA 510(k) clearances in the U.S. for use as a therapy in patients with PAD, and in October 2013, we received PMA to use the CAD System as a therapy in patients with severely calcified CAD.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	These general clearances and approvals restrict our ability to market or advertise the PAD Systems and the CAD System beyond these uses and could affect our growth.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	If we determine to market our orbital technology in the U.S. for other uses, we would need to conduct further clinical trials and obtain premarket approval from the FDA.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Clinical trials are complex, expensive, time consuming, uncertain and subject to substantial and unanticipated delays.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain FDA approval to use our orbital atherectomy technology for applications other than the treatment of PAD and CAD.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We are or will be subject to an extensive set of post-market controls that apply to us as we commercialize our products, including annual PMA reports, Medical Device Reports on serious adverse events, complaint handling and analysis under the FDA's QSR, export controls, advertising and promotion requirements, and potential post-market studies required by the FDA.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We and our suppliers are also subject to regulation by various state authorities, which may inspect our or our suppliers' facilities and manufacturing processes and enforce state regulations.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Failure to comply with applicable state regulations may result in seizures, injunctions or other types of enforcement actions.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our promotion of the PAD and CAD Systems is closely controlled by the FDA and enforcement activities could limit our ability to inform potential customers of the features of the products.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The PAD Systems or the CAD System may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation and product liability claims that could exceed the limits of available insurance coverage.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material regulatory deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P57_S1	For example, since commercialization of the PAD Systems, we have had minor instances of recalls, including, in the year ended June 30, 2015, one recall involving thirty CAD Systems due to an issue with the polymer coating on the saline sheath.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Any recalls of our products or products that we distribute would divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation with customers and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Also, if the PAD or CAD Systems are defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contain defective components or are misused, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P58_S1	The use, misuse or off-label use of the PAD or CAD Systems may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P58_S2	We cannot prevent a physician from using the PAD or CAD Systems for off-label applications.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P58_S3	While we have product liability insurance coverage for our products and intend to maintain such insurance coverage in the future, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected from claims that are brought against us.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We are subject to many laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The PAD and CAD Systems and related manufacturing processes, clinical data, adverse events, recalls or corrections and promotional activities are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory bodies.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P60_S1	In particular, we are required to comply with the QSR and other regulations, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product for which we obtain marketing clearance or approval.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P60_S2	We are also responsible for the quality of components received by our suppliers.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Failure to comply with the QSR requirements or other statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or failure to adequately respond to any observations, could result in, among other things:
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	If any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales to suffer.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our operations are also subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	In addition, our relationships with physicians, hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny under various federal anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws, as further described below.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	If our operations are found to be in violation of these laws, we, as well as our employees, may be subject to penalties, including monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration health programs, workers' compensation programs and TRICARE (the healthcare system administered by or on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense for uniformed services beneficiaries, including active duty and their dependents, retirees and their dependents), and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting kickbacks and false and fraudulent claims which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Additionally, any challenges to or investigations into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, and similar state laws, prohibit payments that are intended to induce health care professionals or others either to refer patients or to purchase, lease, order or arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease or order of healthcare products or services.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P66_S1	A number of states have enacted laws that require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report payments, gifts and other remuneration made to physicians and other health care professionals and health care organizations.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P66_S2	In addition, some state statutes, most notably laws in Massachusetts and Vermont, impose outright bans on certain gifts to physicians as well as requiring reporting of payments to physicians.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Some of these laws, referred to as aggregate spend or gift laws, carry substantial fines if they are violated.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, requires us to collect and report certain data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	It is widely anticipated that public reporting under the Sunshine Act and implementing Open Payments regulations will result in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P68_S1	These anti-kickback, public reporting and aggregate spend laws affect our sales, marketing and other promotional, and clinical activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers or users of medical devices.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P68_S2	They also impose additional administrative and compliance burdens on us.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P68_S3	In particular, these laws influence, among other things, how we structure our sales offerings, including discount practices, customer support, education and training programs, physician consulting and other service arrangements, and clinical trials.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P68_S4	If we were to offer or pay inappropriate inducements to purchase our products, we could be subject to a claim under the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute or similar state laws.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P68_S5	If we fail to comply with particular reporting requirements, we could be subject to penalties under applicable federal or state laws.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P68_S6	Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payments to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or for items or services that were not provided as claimed.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P68_S7	Although we do not submit claims directly to government healthcare programs or other payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims by providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, by providing improper financial inducements, or through certain other activities.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	In providing billing and coding information to customers, we make every effort to ensure that the billing and coding information furnished is accurate and that treating physicians understand that they are responsible for all treatment decisions.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Nevertheless, we cannot provide assurance that the government will regard any billing errors that may be made as inadvertent or that the government will not examine our role in providing information to our customers and physicians concerning the benefits of therapy with our devices.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Likewise, our financial relationships with customers, physicians, or others in a position to influence the purchase or use of our products may be subject to government scrutiny or be alleged or found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P70_S0	False claims laws prescribe civil, criminal and administrative penalties for noncompliance, which can be substantial.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Moreover, an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business and results of operations.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P71_S0	For example, on May 8, 2014, we received a letter from the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Western District of North Carolina stating that it is investigating the Company to determine whether we had violated the False Claims Act.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P71_S1	The letter enclosed a Civil Investigative Demand ( CID ) for written interrogatories and document requests.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P71_S2	On July 8, 2015, the complaint underlying this investigation was unsealed.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P71_S3	We have not yet been served the complaint and cannot predict if or when the complaint will be served on us and whether this case will proceed.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P71_S4	The government has the option to intervene in a False Claims Act case and take over the prosecution if it concludes that the claims have merit.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P71_S5	As of the date hereof, the government has not chosen to intervene in this case.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P71_S6	We maintain rigorous policies and procedures to promote compliance with the False Claims Act and other regulatory requirements and intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit, should it proceed.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P71_S7	However, we cannot predict when the investigation or this litigation will be resolved, the outcome of the investigation or this litigation, or the potential impact of either on us.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P71_S8	The existence of the investigation and litigation and any adverse outcome of either could negatively affect our reputation, be costly to respond to, and harm our business and results of operations.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses, may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries, as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer's efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P73_S1	These disclosure requirements require ongoing due diligence efforts and disclosure obligations.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P73_S2	There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P73_S3	In addition, our ongoing implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our anticipated international expansion will subject us to increased legal and regulatory requirements, which could have a material effect on our business.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We intend to sell internationally in the future and have commenced the process of seeking approval to do so in both Europe and Japan.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Movement into international markets will subject us and our products to different and increased laws and regulations, including foreign medical device regulations; tax laws; increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; export laws; and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P76_S0	operations, including those based in foreign countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will comply with our internal policies.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P76_S1	We will incur additional compliance costs associated with global operations, and any alleged or actual violations of these laws and regulations could subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil fines, sanctions and other liabilities, and prohibitions on business conduct, and could negatively affect our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could allow our competitors and others to produce products based on our technology, which could substantially impair our ability to compete.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Our success and ability to compete depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P78_S1	We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P78_S2	Our issued patents and related intellectual property may not be adequate to protect us or permit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P78_S3	Also, we cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P78_S4	Further, if any patents we obtain or license are deemed invalid and unenforceable, or have their scope narrowed, it could impact our ability to commercialize or license our technology and achieve competitive advantages.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P79_S1	In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, if at all.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We may, in the future, need to assert claims of infringement against third parties to protect our intellectual property.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P80_S1	The outcome of litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in patents, copyrights, trade secrets or trademarks is highly unpredictable, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, reputation and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Despite our efforts to safeguard our unpatented and unregistered intellectual property rights, we may not be successful in doing so or the steps taken by us in this regard may not be adequate to detect or deter misappropriation of our technology or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our products, technology or other information that we regard as proprietary.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P81_S1	In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to litigate, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Additionally, third parties may be able to design around our patents.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P82_S1	In this regard, we seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by having a policy that our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P82_S2	We cannot provide any assurance that employees and third parties will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements, or that we will be effective in securing necessary assignments from these third parties.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others could prohibit us from commercializing products, require us to obtain licenses from third parties or require us to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages and injunctive relief.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P84_S0	The medical technology industry is characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P84_S1	The likelihood that patent infringement or misappropriation claims may be brought against us increases as we achieve more visibility in the marketplace and introduce products to market.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We are aware of numerous patents issued to third parties that relate to the manufacture and use of medical devices for the treatment of vascular disease.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P85_S1	The owners of each of these patents could assert that the manufacture, use or sale of our products infringes one or more claims of their patents.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P85_S2	There could also be existing patents of which we are unaware that one or more aspects of our technology may inadvertently infringe.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P85_S3	In some cases, litigation may be threatened or brought by a patent-holding company or other adverse patent owner who has no relevant product revenues and against whom our patents may provide little or no deterrence.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Any infringement or misappropriation claim could cause us to incur significant costs, place significant strain on our financial resources, divert management's attention from our business and harm our reputation.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P86_S1	If the relevant patents were upheld in litigation as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe, we could be prohibited from commercializing any infringing products unless we could obtain licenses to use the technology covered by the patent or are able to design around the patent.
1180145_15_ITEM1A_P86_S2	We may be unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may not be able to redesign any infringing products to avoid infringement.
1180145_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal executive offices are located in our new headquarters, a 125,000 square foot facility in St. Paul, Minnesota, which contains dedicated research and development, training and education, and manufacturing facilities, and our central administrative offices.
1180145_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	We also have a 47,000 square foot leased facility in St. Paul, Minnesota, that was used for our prior headquarters.
1180145_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	This lease ends in November 2015.
1180145_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	In September 2009, we entered into an agreement to lease a 46,000 square foot production facility in Pearland, Texas beginning in April 2010 through March 2020.
1180145_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	This facility primarily accommodates additional manufacturing activities.
1180145_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	We believe that our current facilities are substantially adequate for our current and anticipated future needs for the foreseeable future.
1180145_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	On May 8, 2014, we received a letter from the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Western District of North Carolina (the Department of Justice ) stating that it is investigating the Company to determine whether we had violated the False Claims Act ( FCA ).
1180145_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	The letter enclosed a Civil Investigative Demand ( CID ) for written interrogatories and document requests.
1180145_15_ITEM3_P0_S2	We are cooperating with the Department of Justice and have provided documents in response to the CID.
1180145_15_ITEM3_P1_S0	On July 8, 2015, the complaint underlying the Department of Justice s investigation was unsealed.
1180145_15_ITEM3_P1_S1	The complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina (the Court ) on July 15, 2013 by Travis Thams (the relator ) under a provision of the FCA that allows private citizens the ability to file suit on behalf of the United States and various states.
1180145_15_ITEM3_P1_S2	The complaint alleges various causes of action under the federal FCA and several state FCA provisions relating to alleged kickbacks and off-label promotion of medical devices and that this alleged conduct has resulted in false claims being submitted to obtain payment or reimbursement.
1180145_15_ITEM3_P1_S3	The relator is seeking, on behalf of the United States, damages in the amount of each allegedly false and fraudulent claim, trebled as per statute, plus civil penalties of up to $11,000 per claim, plus, on behalf of various states, the maximum amounts allowed under various state laws.
1180145_15_ITEM3_P1_S4	The aggregate damages and penalties claimed are currently indeterminable as the alleged unlawful claims have not been specified.
1180145_15_ITEM3_P2_S0	We have not yet been served the complaint and cannot predict if or when the complaint will be served on us and whether this case will proceed.
1180145_15_ITEM3_P2_S1	The government has the option to intervene in an FCA case and take over the prosecution if it concludes that the claims have merit.
1180145_15_ITEM3_P2_S2	As of the date hereof, the Department of Justice has not chosen to intervene in this case.
1180145_15_ITEM3_P2_S3	Instead, the Department of Justice wishes to take more time to evaluate the merits of the claims, so it filed a Notice of the United States That It Is Not Intervening At This Time with the Court.
1180145_15_ITEM3_P3_S0	We maintain rigorous policies and procedures to promote compliance with the FCA and other regulatory requirements and intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit, should it proceed.
1180145_15_ITEM3_P3_S1	However, we cannot predict when the Department of Justice s investigation or this litigation will be resolved, the outcome of the investigation or this litigation, or the potential impact of either on us.

1180145_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	We trade on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol CSII.
1180145_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for our common stock (based upon intra-day trading) as reported by the Nasdaq Global Market:
1180145_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	The number of record holders of our common stock on August 21, 2015 was approximately 183.
1180145_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	No cash dividends have been previously paid on our common stock and none are anticipated during fiscal year 2016.
1180145_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	For information on our equity compensation plans, refer to Item 12, Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.
1180145_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return of our common stock ( CSII ) with the return of the Standard Poor's 500 Stock Index ( S P ) and the S P Health Care Index ( S P HC ) from June 30, 2010 through June 30, 2015.
1180145_15_ITEM5_P3_S1	The comparisons assume $100 was invested on June 30, 2010 in our common stock, the S P 500 Stock Index and the S P Health Care Index and also assumes that any dividends are reinvested.
1180145_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	The returns set forth on the following graph are based on historical results and are not intended to suggest future performance.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	You should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our business and operations, based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance, that involve risks and uncertainties.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many important factors, including the factors we describe under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are a medical device company focused on developing and commercializing innovative solutions for vascular and coronary disease.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) products, the Stealth 360 Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy System ( OAS )(the Stealth 360 ), the Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS (the Diamondback 360 Peripheral ), the Diamondback 360 60cm Peripheral OAS access device, and the Diamondback 360 4 French 1.25 Peripheral OAS access device are catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of plaque types in leg arteries both above and below the knee and address many of the limitations associated with existing surgical, catheter and pharmacological treatment alternatives.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	The micro-invasive devices use smaller access sheaths that can provide procedural benefits and allow physicians to treat PAD patients in the small and tortuous vessels located below the knee through alternative access sites in the ankle and foot as well as in the groin.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	We no longer market the Diamondback Predator 360 (the Predator 360 ).
1180145_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	We refer to the Stealth 360, Diamondback 360 Peripheral, Diamondback 360 60cm Peripheral OAS, Diamondback 360 4 French 1.25 Peripheral OAS, and Predator 360 collectively in this report as the PAD Systems.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our coronary arterial disease ( CAD ) product, Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS ( CAD System ), is marketed as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	The CAD System is a catheter-based platform designed to facilitate stent delivery in patients with CAD who are acceptable candidates for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or stenting due to de novo , severely calcified coronary artery lesions.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	The CAD System design is similar to technology used in our PAD Systems, customized specifically for the coronary application.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	From 1989 to 1997, we engaged in research and development on several different product concepts.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	Since 1997, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development of the PAD Systems and, since 2007, to the approval of our CAD System.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	From 2003 to 2005, we conducted numerous bench and animal tests in preparation for application submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ).
1180145_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	We initially focused our testing on providing a solution for coronary in-stent restenosis, but later changed the focus to PAD.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	In 2006, we obtained an investigational device exemption from the FDA to conduct our pivotal OASIS PAD clinical trial, which was completed in January 2007.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P5_S3	The OASIS clinical trial was a prospective 20-center study that involved 124 patients with 201 lesions.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	In August 2007, the FDA granted us 510(k) clearance for the use of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral as a therapy in patients with PAD.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	We commenced commercial introduction of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral in the United States in September 2007.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	We were granted 510(k) clearance of the Predator 360 in March 2009 and Stealth 360 in March 2011, which are no longer marketed.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P6_S3	We received 510(k) clearance of the Diamondback 360 60cm Peripheral OAS in March 2014, and in April 2015, we received 510(k) clearance of the Diamondback 360 4 French 1.25 Peripheral OAS.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P6_S4	We market the PAD Systems in the United States through a direct sales force and expend significant capital on our sales and marketing efforts to expand our customer base and utilization per customer.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P6_S5	We assemble at our facilities the saline infusion pump and the single-use catheter used in the PAD Systems with components purchased from third-party suppliers, as well as with components manufactured in-house.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P6_S6	Supplemental products are purchased from third-party suppliers.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	We are evaluating options for international expansion to maximize the coronary and peripheral market opportunities.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	We have developed modified versions of the PAD System to treat coronary arteries.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	A coronary application required us to conduct a clinical trial and file a premarket approval ( PMA ) application, and obtain approval from the FDA.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	In March 2013, we completed submission of our PMA application to the FDA for our orbital atherectomy system to treat calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	In October 2013, we received PMA from the FDA to market the CAD System as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P9_S3	We commenced a controlled commercial launch of our CAD System following receipt of PMA.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	As of June 30, 2015 , we had an accumulated deficit of $271.4 million .
1180145_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	We expect our losses to continue as we invest in sales, marketing, medical education, clinical studies and product research and development for our next phase of growth in the peripheral market and continue the commercialization of our CAD System.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	To date, we have financed our operations primarily from the issuance of common and preferred stock, convertible promissory notes, and debt.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	We derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of PAD Systems, the CAD System and other ancillary products.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	The PAD and CAD Systems use a disposable, single-use, low-profile catheter that travels over our proprietary ViperWire guide wire.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	The systems use a saline infusion pump as a power supply for the operation of the catheter.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	Our ancillary products include the ViperSlide Lubricant and ViperTrack Radiopaque Tape.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	We also had an exclusive distribution agreement with Asahi to market its peripheral guide wire line in the United States, which expired in June 2015.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	We assemble the single-use catheter with components purchased from third-party suppliers, as well as with components manufactured in-house.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	The infusion pump and guide wires are purchased from third-party suppliers.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses include compensation for executive, sales, marketing, finance, information technology, human resources and administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	Other significant expenses include the medical device excise tax, bad debt expense, travel, marketing costs and professional fees.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing, enhancement and regulatory approval of our products.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	Research and development expenses include employee compensation including stock-based compensation, supplies and materials, patent expenses, consulting expenses, travel and facilities overhead.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	We also incur significant expenses to operate clinical trials, including trial design, third-party fees, clinical site reimbursement, data management and travel expenses.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P16_S3	All research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Approved patent applications are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Interest and other, net primarily includes interest expense (including premium and discount amortization), interest income, change in the fair value of the debt conversion option, debt refinancing costs, and net write-offs upon debt conversion (option and unamortized premium or discount).
1180145_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Interest expense (including premium and discount amortization) results from outstanding debt balances and debt premiums and discounts.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Interest income is attributed to interest earned on deposits in investments that consist of money market funds.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Change in Fair Value of Debt Conversion Option.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Change in fair value of debt conversion option represents the period to period change in fair value of the debt conversion option associated with outstanding convertible debt.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Net write-offs upon debt conversion are the result of the conversion of convertible debt, and include the write-off of the related debt conversion option and any unamortized debt premium or discount.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Other consists of miscellaneous non-operating expenses, including state taxes.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	We have established valuation allowances to fully offset our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty about our ability to generate the future taxable income necessary to realize these deferred assets, particularly in light of our historical losses.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	The future use of net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on us attaining profitable operations and will be limited in any one year under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 due to significant ownership changes (as defined in Section 382) resulting from our equity financings.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	At June 30, 2015 , we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax reporting purposes of approximately $197.5 million , which will expire at various dates through fiscal 2033.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect amounts reported in those statements.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	Our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, excess and obsolete inventory, and stock-based compensation are updated as appropriate at least quarterly.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P25_S3	We use authoritative pronouncements, our technical accounting knowledge, cumulative business experience, valuation specialists, judgment and other factors in the selection and application of our accounting policies.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P25_S4	While we believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments that we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements are appropriate, these estimates, assumptions and judgments are subject to factors and uncertainties regarding their outcome.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P25_S5	Therefore, actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	Some of our significant accounting policies require us to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	We sell the majority of our products via direct shipment to hospitals or office-based labs.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	We record estimated sales returns, discounts and rebates as a reduction of net sales.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	Costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period the revenue is recognized.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	Cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	This allowance is an estimate and is regularly evaluated for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience, credit quality of the customer base, age of the receivable balances, both individually and in the aggregate, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	Provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts attributed to bad debt are recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	We have inventories that are principally comprised of capitalized direct labor and manufacturing overhead, raw materials and components, and finished goods.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	Due to the technological nature of our products, there is a risk of obsolescence for changes in our technology and the market, which is impacted by technological developments and events.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	Accordingly, we write down our inventories as we become aware of any situation where the carrying amount exceeds the estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future demands and market conditions.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P31_S3	The evaluation includes analysis of inventory levels, expected product lives, product at risk of expiration, sales levels by product and projections of future sales demand.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	We have stock-based compensation plans, which include stock options, nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	We determine the fair value of our option awards using option-pricing models.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	We determine the fair value of nonvested share awards with market conditions using the Monte Carlo simulation.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	Fair value of nonvested share awards that vest based upon performance or time conditions is determined by the closing market price of our stock on the date of grant.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	Stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period for the awards expected to vest.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	Management's key assumptions are developed with input from independent third-party valuation advisors.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	In accordance with FASB guidance, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements related to legal proceedings when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	If a loss is possible, but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P35_S3	In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands), and, for certain line items, the changes between the specified periods:
1180145_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Revenues increased by $44.9 million , or 32.9% , from $136.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2014 to $181.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 .
1180145_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	This increase was primarily attributable to sales of our CAD System which contributed approximately $26.9 million in revenues for the year ended June 30, 2015, compared to approximately $5.0 million in the year ended June 30, 2014 following our PMA in October 2013.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P37_S2	Revenues from our PAD Systems increased $19.0 million, or 16.5%, which reflects 16.7% more device units sold.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P37_S3	Other product revenue also increased $4.1 million, or 25.1%, during the year ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2014 , primarily driven by increased sales of PAD and CAD Systems, which the other products support.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P37_S4	Currently, all of our revenues are in the United States; however, we intend to sell internationally in the future and have commenced the process of seeking approval to do so in both Europe and Japan.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P37_S5	In November 2014, we received CE Mark for the Stealth 360 and are currently evaluating the timing and structure of our plans to commercialize products in Europe.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P37_S6	We expect our revenue to increase as we continue to increase the number of physicians using the devices, increase the usage per physician, introduce new and improved products, generate additional clinical data, continue the controlled commercial launch of our CAD System, and expand into new geographies.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Cost of goods sold increased by $8.5 million, or 27.3% , from $31.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2014 to $39.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 .
1180145_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	These amounts represent the cost of materials, labor and overhead for single-use catheters, guide wires, pumps, and other ancillary products.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	The increase was due to an increase in the quantities of products sold, partially offset by lower indirect costs per unit from higher production volumes and manufacturing efficiencies.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	The increase in gross margin from 77.3% for the year ended June 30, 2014 , to 78.2% for the year ended June 30, 2015 , was primarily due to the increase in sales of our CAD System, which has a higher average selling price than the PAD Systems, and to lower indirect costs per unit.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P38_S4	Cost of goods sold for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 includes $1.0 million and $0.7 million , respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P38_S5	We expect that gross margin in fiscal 2016 will improve slightly compared to fiscal 2015.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Quarterly fluctuations could occur based on production volumes, timing of new product introductions, sales mix, changes in selling prices, or other unanticipated circumstances.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses .
1180145_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $25.7 million , or 21.8% , from $118.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2014 to $143.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 .
1180145_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2015 have increased due to higher expenses from the coronary commercial launch, the expansion of our sales and marketing organization, increased medical education, and higher incentive and stock-based compensation.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 include $12.2 million and $9.2 million , respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P40_S4	We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as a result of the costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing organization to further commercialize our PAD Systems and expand the commercial launch of our CAD System.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	Research and development expenses increased by $9.9 million , or 47.0% , from $21.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2014 to $31.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 .
1180145_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	Research and development expenses relate to the specific projects to develop new products or expand into new markets, such as the development of new versions of our PAD and CAD Systems, shaft designs, crown design, and PAD and CAD clinical studies.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	The increase primarily related to additional product development projects and clinical studies, and the related increase in headcount.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	Research and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 include $1.5 million and $1.1 million , respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P41_S4	As we continue to expand our product portfolio and clinical studies within the PAD and CAD markets, we generally expect to incur research and development expenses above amounts incurred for the year ended June 30, 2015 .
1180145_15_ITEM7_P41_S5	Fluctuations could occur based on the number of projects and studies and the timing of expenditures.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Interest and other, net was $(0.2) million and $(1.8) million for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	The decrease was primarily driven by lower interest expense related to lower outstanding debt balances, as well as charges in the prior year from debt conversions and changes in fair value of the debt conversion option that were associated with previously outstanding convertible debt.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Net loss for the year ended June 30, 2015 was $(32.8) million , compared to $(35.3) million for the year ended June 30, 2014 .
1180145_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	Our net loss decreased as a result of higher revenues and gross profit, partially offset by increased operating expenses.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	Revenues increased by $32.7 million, or 31.5%, from $103.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2013 to $136.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2014.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	This increase was primarily attributable to a $24.2 million, or 26.5%, increase in revenue from PAD Systems sold, which reflects a 30.8% increase in number of device units sold, partially offset by a 3.3% reduction in average selling prices.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	Additionally, sales of our CAD System contributed approximately $5.0 million in revenues following our PMA in October 2013.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	Other product revenue also increased $3.5 million, or 28.0%, during the year ended June 30, 2014 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2013, primarily driven by increased sales of PAD and CAD Systems, which the products support.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Cost of goods sold increased by $6.6 million, or 27.3%, from $24.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2013 to $31.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2014.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	These amounts represent the cost of materials, labor and overhead for single-use catheters, guide wires, control units, and other ancillary products.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	The increase was due to an increase in the quantities of products sold, partially offset by lower indirect costs per unit from higher production volumes and manufacturing efficiencies.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P45_S3	The increase in gross margin from 76.5% during the year ended June 30, 2013, to 77.3% for the year ended June 30, 2014, was primarily due to lower indirect costs per unit, partially offset by lower average selling prices of PAD Systems.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P45_S4	Cost of goods sold for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 includes $0.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $31.3 million, or 36.1%, from $86.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2013 to $118.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2014.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2014 increased due to our commercial CAD System launch, the expansion of our sales and marketing organization, increased variable compensation, increased promotion and medical education programs, higher stock-based compensation, increased costs related to health care policy initiatives and higher medical device excise taxes.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 include $9.2 million and $6.2 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Research and development expenses increased by $5.9 million, or 38.4%, from $15.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2013 to $21.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2014.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	Research and development expenses relate to the specific projects to develop new products or expand into new markets, such as the development of new versions of the PAD and CAD Systems, shaft designs, crown design, and PAD and CAD clinical studies.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	The increase primarily related to additional product development projects and clinical studies that began in fiscal 2014, and the related increase in headcount.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P47_S3	Research and development expenses for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 include $1.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Interest and other, net was $(1.8) million and $(1.6) million for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	The increase was primarily due to the change in fair value of the debt conversion option that was associated with the previously outstanding convertible debt (changes in fair value were primarily driven by the change in the market value of our common stock) and the write-offs associated with the debt conversions.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	Slightly offsetting this was a decrease in interest expense as a result of lower debt balances.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Net loss for the year ended June 30, 2014 was $(35.3) million, compared to $(24.0) million for the year ended June 30, 2013.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	Our net loss increased as a result of increased operating expenses, partially offset by higher gross profit.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	To supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, our management uses a non-GAAP financial measure referred to as Adjusted EBITDA.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands):
1180145_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA of $5.6 million, or 26.4%, is primarily the result of the $3.8 million, or 34.7%, increase in stock-based compensation.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	Stock-based compensation increased as a result of increased employee stock awards granted due to our expanded headcount and higher grant date fair values.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	depreciation and amortization, which increased as a result of the completion of our new headquarters in March 2015, additional investment in capital equipment and patents, as well as a decrease in the loss from operations.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	The loss from operations was impacted by an increase in revenues and gross profit, slightly offset by increased operating expenses.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of performance and believe this measure facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by factoring out potential differences caused by non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expense.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA to analyze the underlying trends in our business, assess the performance of our core operations, establish operational goals and forecasts that are used to allocate resources and evaluate our performance period over period and in relation to our competitors operating results.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	We believe that presenting Adjusted EBITDA provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	We also believe that providing this information better enables our investors to understand our operating performance and evaluate the methodology used by our management to evaluate and measure such performance.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	The following is an explanation of each of the items that management excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and the reasons for excluding each of these individual items:
1180145_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP financial measures primarily because such expense, while constituting an ongoing and recurring expense, is not an expense that requires cash settlement.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	Our management also believes that excluding this item from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand its impact on our operational performance, liquidity and ability to make additional investments in the Company, and it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	We exclude depreciation and amortization expense from our non-GAAP financial measures primarily because such expenses, while constituting ongoing and recurring expenses, are not expenses that require cash settlement and are not used by our management to assess the core profitability of our business operations.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	Our management also believes that excluding these items from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand our operational performance, liquidity and ability to make additional investments in the Company.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	Some of the limitations associated with our use of these non-GAAP financial measures are:
1180145_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	Items such as stock-based compensation do not directly affect our cash flow position; however, such items reflect economic costs to us and are not reflected in our Adjusted EBITDA and therefore these non-GAAP measures do not reflect the full economic effect of these items.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore other companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	Our management exercises judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures we use.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily upon our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	We had cash and cash equivalents of $83.8 million and $126.6 million at June 30, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	During the year ended June 30, 2015 , net cash used in operations amounted to $22.4 million .
1180145_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	As of June 30, 2015 , we had an accumulated deficit of $271.4 million .
1180145_15_ITEM7_P63_S3	We have historically funded our operating losses primarily from the issuance of stock, convertible promissory notes, and debt.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P63_S4	Our prior line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank matured on December 31, 2014, and our loan and security agreement with Partners for Growth III, L.P. matured on April 14, 2015.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P63_S5	See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	We had the following registered underwritten public offerings during the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013:
1180145_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	(1) Proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses (in thousands).
1180145_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	We have used, and intend to use, the net proceeds from the offerings for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not limited to:
1180145_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	We may also use a portion of the net proceeds offering for the potential acquisition of businesses, technologies and products.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to us from the offerings.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion over the use of these proceeds.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in investment-grade, interest-bearing securities.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	Cash and cash equivalents was $83.8 million and $126.6 million at June 30, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	The decrease was primarily attributable to net cash used in operating and investing activities during the year ended June 30, 2015.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	Net cash used in operating activities was $22.4 million , $26.8 million , and $10.8 million for the years ended June 30, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	For the years ended June 30, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , we had a net loss of $32.8 million , $35.3 million , and $24.0 million , respectively.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	Changes in working capital accounts also contributed to the net cash used in the years ended June 30, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 .
1180145_15_ITEM7_P70_S3	Significant changes in working capital during these periods included:
1180145_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	Cash used in accounts receivable was $10.6 million , $6.7 million , and $1.3 million during the years ended June 30, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	Cash used in accounts receivable is due to higher receivable balances from revenue growth, which has grown in each of the last three fiscal years.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	Cash (used in) provided by inventory was $(1.1) million , $(6.6) million , and $0.8 million during the years ended June 30, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	Cash used by inventory in fiscal 2015 and 2014 was due to higher levels of inventory for future sales growth, including the CAD System commercial launch, as well as timing of inventory purchases and sales.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	Cash provided by inventories in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the timing of inventory purchases and sales.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	Cash (used in) provided by prepaid expenses and other current assets was $(1.2) million , $(0.6) million , and $0.9 million during the years ended June 30, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	Cash (used in) provided by prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to payment timing of vendor deposits and other expenditures.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	Cash provided by accounts payable was $0.6 million , $2.4 million , and $1.5 million during the years ended June 30, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	Cash provided by accounts payable was primarily due to timing of purchases and vendor payments and overall increased levels of expenses.
1180145_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	Cash provided by accrued expenses and other liabilities was $4.4 million , $6.7 million , and $2.5 million during the years ended June 30, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively.

1180145_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk or availability.

1180145_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk.

1180145_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive loss, of changes in shareholders equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. at June 30, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1180145_15_ITEM8_P1_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

1180145_15_ITEM8_P1_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1180145_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	There were no changes to total current liabilities and net cash used in operations as a result of these reclassifications.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company reclassified $2,996 from accounts payable to accrued expenses as of June 30, 2014.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P16_S1	In addition, the Company reclassified the changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the operating activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows by $2,249 and $17 for the years ended June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013.

1180145_15_ITEM8_P18_S4	This allowance is an estimate and is regularly evaluated by the Company for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience, credit quality of the customer base, age of the receivable balances, both individually and in the aggregate, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P18_S5	Provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts attributed to bad debt are recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	The following table shows the allowance for doubtful accounts activity:

1180145_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	Property and equipment is carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 40 years for the building; five to seven years for production equipment and furniture and fixtures; three years for computer equipment and software; and the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term for leasehold improvements.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P22_S2	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs and minor renewals and betterments which do not extend or improve the life of the respective assets are expensed as incurred.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P22_S3	All other expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P22_S4	The assets and related depreciation accounts are adjusted for property retirements and disposals with the resulting gains or losses included in the consolidated statement of operations.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	The capitalized costs incurred to obtain patents are amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P23_S1	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	The recoverability of capitalized patent costs is dependent upon the Company s ability to derive revenue-producing products from such patents or the ultimate sale or licensing of such patent rights.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P24_S1	Patent recoverability is regularly reviewed and any patents that are abandoned are written off at the time of abandonment.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company regularly evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or that the remaining estimated useful life should be changed.

1180145_15_ITEM8_P26_S1	The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated by the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value.

1180145_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	The excise tax is 2.3% of the taxable base and applies to a substantial majority of the Company's sales.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	For the years ended June 30, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the Company incurred approximately $2,731 , $2,273 , and $987 , respectively.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P33_S1	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	Developing a provision for income taxes, including the effective tax rate and the analysis of potential tax exposure items, if any, requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws, regulations and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	The Company s judgment and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	Accounting guidance requires that accounting for uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in the financial statements.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	The guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P35_S2	Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P35_S3	The guidance also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing, enhancement and regulatory approval of the Company s products.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P36_S1	Research and development expenses include employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), supplies and materials, consulting expenses, patent amortization, travel and facilities overhead.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P36_S2	The Company also incurs significant expenses to operate clinical trials, including trial design, third-party fees, clinical site reimbursement, data management and travel expenses.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P36_S3	Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	Approved patent applications are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P37_S1	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years .
1180145_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company maintains its cash balances primarily with one financial institution.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	These balances exceed federally insured limits.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P39_S2	The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in cash and cash equivalents.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company believes that the credit risk related to marketable securities is limited due to the adherence to an investment policy and that credit risk related to accounts receivable is limited due to a large customer base.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company's marketable securities consist solely of available-for-sale securities and were valued in accordance with the fair value measurement guidance discussed below.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of stockholders' equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P41_S2	Realized gains and losses, if any, are calculated on the specific identification method and are included in interest and other, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	Available-for-sale securities are reviewed for possible impairment at least quarterly, or more frequently if circumstances arise which may indicate impairment.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	When the fair value of the securities declines below the amortized cost basis, impairment is indicated and it must be determined whether it is other than temporary.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P42_S2	Impairment is considered to be other than temporary if the Company: (i) intends to sell the security, (ii) will more likely than not be forced to sell the security before recovering its cost, or (iii) does not expect to recover the security's amortized cost basis.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P42_S3	If the decline in fair value is considered other than temporary, the cost basis of the security is adjusted to its fair market value and the realized loss is reported in earnings.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P42_S4	Subsequent increases or decreases in fair value are reported in equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
1180145_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	Under the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	The authoritative guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	The categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	The hierarchy is broken down into three levels defined as follows:
1180145_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	As of June 30, 2015 , the Company believes that the carrying amounts of its other financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	See Note 9 for additional information.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	The preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P48_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company has stock-based compensation plans, which include stock options, nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	Fair value of option awards is determined using option-pricing models, fair value of nonvested share awards with market conditions is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation, and fair value of nonvested share awards that vest based upon performance or service conditions is determined by the closing market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P49_S2	Stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period for the awards expected to vest.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue From Customers With Contracts.

1180145_15_ITEM8_P102_S0	The Company offers certain members of management and highly compensated employees the opportunity to defer up to 100% of their base salary (after 401(k), payroll tax and other deductions), performance bonus and discretionary bonus and elect to receive the deferred compensation at a fixed future date of participant s choosing.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P102_S1	Each participant may, at the time of his or her deferral election, choose to allocate the deferred compensation into investment alternatives set by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee at that time.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P102_S2	The amount payable to each participant under the plan will change in value based upon the investment selected by that participant and is classified as current or long-term on the Company's balance sheet based on the disbursement elections made by the participants.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P102_S3	As of June 30, 2015, the amount payable is all classified as long-term and is included in the other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

1180145_15_ITEM8_P103_S1	These available-for-sale marketable securities are primarily comprised of investments with a fixed income and equity investments.

1180145_15_ITEM8_P106_S0	The gross amount of realized losses on a scheduled disbursement during the year ended June 30, 2015 was not material.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P107_S0	The following table provides information by level for the Company's available-for-sale marketable securities as of June 30, 2015 that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

1180145_15_ITEM8_P108_S2	There were no transfers of assets between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value measurement hierarchy during the year ended June 30, 2015 .
1180145_15_ITEM8_P108_S3	Any transfers between levels would be recognized on the date of the event or when a change in circumstances causes a transfer.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P109_S0	The components of the Company s overall deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1180145_15_ITEM8_P110_S0	The Company has established valuation allowances to fully offset its deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty about the Company s ability to generate the future taxable income necessary to realize these deferred assets, particularly in light of the Company s historical losses.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P110_S1	The future use of net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on the Company attaining profitable operations, and may be limited in any one year under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 due to significant ownership changes, as defined under such Section, as a result of the Company s equity financings.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P111_S0	A summary of the valuation allowances are as follows:
1180145_15_ITEM8_P112_S0	As of June 30, 2015 and 2014 , the Company had federal tax NOL carryforwards of approximately $197,501 and $159,237 , respectively.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P112_S1	These NOL carryforwards are available to offset taxable income through 2033 and begin to expire in 2018.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P112_S2	The Company also had various state NOL carryforwards available to offset future state taxable income.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P112_S3	These state NOL carryforwards typically have the same expirations as the Company s federal tax NOL carryforwards.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P113_S0	Our federal net operating losses at June 30, 2015 do not include $37,192 of income tax deductions in excess of previously recorded tax benefits related to stock compensation.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P113_S1	These additional tax deductions are not included in the net operating losses referenced above since the related tax benefit will not be recognized until the deductions reduce our income tax payable.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P113_S2	The tax benefit of these excess deductions will be reflected as a credit to additional paid in capital when recognized.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P113_S3	Accordingly, our deferred tax assets are reported net of the excess tax deductions for stock compensation.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P114_S0	As of June 30, 2015 and 2014 , the Company had approximately $3,798 and $3,624 of federal research and development credit carryforwards, respectively.

1180145_15_ITEM8_P114_S2	The federal and state research and development credit carryforwards will expire through fiscal 2035 and 2029, respectively.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P115_S0	As required by FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, the Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P115_S1	For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P115_S2	The Company recorded a liability relating to unrecognized tax benefits of $494 and $458 at June 30, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P115_S3	Due to the Company having a full valuation allowance, this liability has been netted against the deferred tax asset.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P115_S4	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax provisions as part of the provision for income taxes.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P116_S0	Company has not currently reserved for any interest or penalties for such reserves due to the Company being in an NOL position.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P116_S1	The Company does not expect to recognize any benefits from the unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.

1180145_15_ITEM8_P123_S1	The facility primarily serves as an additional manufacturing location for the Company.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P124_S0	The Company and the PEDC entered into a Corporate Job Creation Agreement dated June 17, 2009 , which was subsequently amended July 2, 2012 .
1180145_15_ITEM8_P124_S1	The Job Creation Agreement, as amended, provided the Company with $2,975 in net cash incentive funds.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P124_S2	The Company believes it will be able to comply with the conditions specified in the amended agreement.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P125_S0	The PEDC will provide the Company with an additional $425 of net cash incentive funds if: (1) the Company hires 125 full-time employee at the facility on or before June 30, 2015 and (2) maintains 125 employees at the facility through June 30, 2016.

1180145_15_ITEM8_P126_S0	In order to retain all of the cash incentives, the Company must have maintained no fewer than 25 jobs at the Texas facility through June 30, 2015.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P126_S1	Failure to meet this requirement would have resulted in an obligation to make reimbursement payments to the PEDC as outlined in the amended agreement.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P126_S2	As of June 30, 2015 , the Company was in compliance with all minimum requirements under the amended agreement.
1180145_15_ITEM8_P126_S3	The Company will not have any reimbursement requirements after June 30, 2015.

1180145_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	We are a medical technology company leading the way in the effort to successfully treat patients suffering from peripheral and coronary artery diseases, including those with arterial calcium, the most difficult arterial disease to treat.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	We are committed to clinical rigor, constant innovation and a defining drive to set the industry standard to deliver safe and effective medical devices that improve lives of patients facing this difficult disease state.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	We have developed a patented orbital atherectomy technology for both peripheral and coronary commercial applications.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our peripheral artery disease systems are catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of plaque types in leg arteries both above and below the knee and address many of the limitations associated with other treatment alternatives.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P5_S2	We refer to the Diamondback 360 Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy System ( OAS ) ( Diamondback 360 Peripheral ), the Stealth 360 OAS ( Stealth 360 ), and the products included in the chart below, collectively in this annual report on Form 10-K as the Peripheral OAS.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) granted us 510(k) clearance for the following Peripheral OAS as a therapy in patients with peripheral artery disease ( PAD ):
1180145_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	As of June 30, 2016 , over 244,000 of our Peripheral OAS have been sold to leading institutions across the United States.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	Sales of Peripheral OAS during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 represented 72% of revenue.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	Our coronary product, the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS ( Coronary OAS ), is a catheter-based platform designed to facilitate stent delivery in patients with coronary artery disease ( CAD ) who are acceptable candidates for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or stenting due to de novo , severely calcified coronary artery lesions.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	The Coronary OAS design is similar to technology used in our Peripheral OAS, customized specifically for the coronary application.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	In October 2013, we received premarket approval ( PMA ) from the FDA to market the Coronary OAS as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P8_S3	We commenced a commercial launch that same month and as of June 30, 2016 , over 18,000 Coronary OAS have been sold to leading institutions across the United States.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P8_S4	Sales of Coronary OAS during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 represented approximately 20% of revenue.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	In addition to the Peripheral and Coronary OAS, we intend to expand our product portfolio through internal product development and establishment of business relationships with other medical device companies.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	We offer multiple accessory products required for use with the Peripheral and Coronary OAS.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	Sales of accessory products, primarily guide wires, represented 8% of revenue during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 .
1180145_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	In October 2014, we received CE Mark for our Stealth 360 device and are currently evaluating the timing and structure of our plans to commercialize our products in Europe.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	In July 2016, we submitted an application to Japan's Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency ( PMDA ) for approval of our Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown, our second generation coronary device.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	Pending approval, Japan would become the first international market for any CSI product and would represent a significant milestone for us.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P12_S2	We are currently evaluating potential distribution partners in Japan.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	We will continue to evaluate options for international expansion to maximize the coronary and peripheral market opportunities.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	Peripheral artery disease typically refers to the chronic obstruction of the arteries supplying the lower extremities due to plaque deposition on the walls of the arteries resulting in inadequate blood flow to the limbs.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	The anatomy of lower extremity arteries varies by location: arteries above the knee are generally long, straight and relatively wide compared to arteries below the knee, which tend to be shorter, more tortuous, and branch into progressively smaller in diameter arteries distally.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	The most common early symptoms of PAD are pain, cramping, or fatigue in the leg or hip muscles while walking, which typically subsides at rest.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	Symptoms may progress to include numbness, tingling or weakness in the leg and, in severe cases, burning or aching pain in the leg, foot, or toes while resting.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P16_S2	As PAD progresses, additional signs and symptoms occur, including cooling or color changes in the skin of the legs or feet.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	If left untreated, PAD may continue to progress to Critical Limb Ischemia ( CLI ), a condition in which the amount of oxygenated blood being delivered to the limb is insufficient to keep the tissue alive.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	CLI may lead to large non-healing ulcers, infections, gangrene, limb amputation or death.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	Patients with Peripheral Arterial Disease, Hirsch et al, 2005).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	CLI results in an estimated 160,000 amputations per year in the United States.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	According to estimates by the American Heart Association, as many as 8 to 12 million Americans have PAD.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	In addition, there are two other primary references used for estimating PAD prevalence: the patient Ankle Brachial Index ( ABI ) and the diabetes method.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P20_S2	The most recent comprehensive study, based on ABI, estimates the U.S. prevalence at 8.5 million (Allison et al, Ethnic-Specific Prevalence of Peripheral Arterial Disease in the United States, Circulation, 2007).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P20_S3	Alternatively, a study by The SAGE Group, based on the diabetes method, estimated prevalence at 17.6 million in 2010 (The SAGE Group, The Diabetes Method, 2011).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P20_S4	An aging population, coupled with increasing incidence of diabetes and obesity, is likely to continue to increase the prevalence of PAD.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	In many older PAD patients, particularly those with diabetes, PAD is characterized by fibrotic (moderately hard) or calcified (extremely hard) plaque deposits that can be very challenging to treat.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	Although we believe the rate of PAD diagnoses is increasing, we also believe that under-diagnosis continues, due to patients failing to display symptoms or physicians misinterpreting symptoms as normal aging.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	Emphasis on PAD education from industry, medical associations, insurance companies and other groups, coupled with publications in medical journals and public news channels, is increasing physician and patient awareness of PAD risk factors, symptoms, and treatment options.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association in 2011 lowered the recommended age for testing for PAD from 70 to 65, or 50 if the patient has a history of smoking or diabetes.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	As these guidelines are incorporated into physician practice, PAD diagnosis rates are forecasted to increase.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P23_S2	Physicians manage a significant portion of the PAD diagnosed population by recommending lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, and by prescribing prescription drugs.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P23_S3	While medications, diet and exercise may improve blood flow, they do not treat the underlying obstructions, and many patients have difficulty maintaining lifestyle changes.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P23_S4	As a result of these challenges, many medically managed patients develop more severe symptoms that require procedural intervention.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	Heart disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease in the United States and is a life-threatening condition.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	CAD occurs when a fatty material called plaque builds up on the walls of arteries that supply blood to the heart.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	The plaque buildup causes the arteries to harden and narrow (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	The risk of CAD increases if a person has one or more of the following: high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, or family history of early heart disease.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	According to the American Heart Association, 15.4 million people in the United States suffer from CAD, the most common form of heart disease.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	Heart disease claims more than 600,000 lives in the United States each year.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	According to estimates, significant arterial calcium is present in nearly 40% of patients, and severe calcium affects up to 20% of patients, undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	Significant calcium contributes to poor outcomes and higher treatment costs in coronary interventions when traditional therapies are used, including a significantly higher occurrence of death and major adverse cardiac events ( MACE ).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our orbital atherectomy systems represent an innovative approach to the treatment of PAD and CAD that provide physicians and patients with a procedure that addresses many of the limitations of other treatment alternatives.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS devices are single-use catheters that incorporate a control handle and flexible drive shaft with an offset diamond-coated crown.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	The peripheral device is often used for vessel preparation to enable low pressure percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and results in lower use of bail out stents, and many physicians also use OAS to prepare vessels for the use of drug coated balloons.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P31_S2	The coronary device is used to treat severe calcium prior to stent delivery to facilitate stent expansion and prevent malapposition of stent struts.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	The OAS treats atherosclerotic plaque, which is harder than a normal vessel wall.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	The OAS is designed to differentiate between hard, diseased plaque and healthy, compliant arterial tissue, a concept that we refer to as differential sanding.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P32_S2	The diamond-coated crown preferentially engages and sands away harder material, but is designed not to damage more compliant parts of the artery, which flex away from the crown.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	Physicians position the crown at the site of a lesion containing arterial plaque and orbit the crown against it to sand away the superficial, or surface, plaque and create a smooth lumen, or channel, in the vessel.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	In addition, the crown's rotating eccentric mass and orbital motion deliver pulsatile mechanical energy.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P33_S2	These pulsatile forces may break up deeper plaque and contribute to compliance change of the diseased segment of the artery.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	Our OAS uses a single-use, low-profile catheter that travels over our proprietary ViperWire guide wires and is powered by saline infusion pumps that also help cool the system and remove debris.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	The Peripheral OAS reduces plaque on peripheral vessel walls by using an orbiting, diamond-coated crown within peripheral arteries.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	Similarly, the Coronary OAS uses the same method to reduce severely calcified plaque on coronary vessel walls within coronary arteries in order to facilitate stent delivery.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	The catheter for our OAS consists of:
1180145_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	a sheath, which covers the drive shaft and permits delivery of saline or medications to the treatment area.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	ViperWire Advance Peripheral Guide Wire, ViperWire Advance Peripheral Guide Wire with Flex Tip and ViperWire Advance Coronary Guide Wire.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	The ViperWire guide wires were designed to offer an improved ability to maneuver through tortuous, twisting blood vessels and cross challenging lesions.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	The OAS travels over this wire to the lesion and operates on this wire.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	ViperSlide is an exclusive lubricant designed to optimize the smooth operation of the OAS.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	The saline infusion pump mounts directly to the intravenous pole and bathes the OAS shaft and crown and provides an electric power supply for the operation of the catheter.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	The constant flow of saline during orbit reduces the risk of heat generation and improves the flush of particulates.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	The mechanism of action is a function of the centrifugal force generated by the eccentrically mounted crown as it rotates and orbits inside the vessel.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	As the speed of the crown's rotation increases, centrifugal force increases the crown's radius of orbit and presses the diamond-coated crown against the lesion or plaque, removing a small amount of plaque with each orbit.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P42_S2	The centrifugal force exerted onto the vessel wall decreases as the orbital radius increases, reducing the likelihood of adverse events during treatment.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	The characteristics of the orbit and the resulting lumen size can be adjusted by modifying the following two variables:
1180145_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	An increase in speed creates a larger orbital radius, thus accommodating larger diameter vessels.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Our Peripheral OAS allows the user to choose between three rotational speeds.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	Our Coronary OAS allows the user to choose between two rotational speeds.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	The crowns for the OAS are designed with various weights (as determined by crown geometry and material density) and are coated with diamond particles.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	The Peripheral OAS crowns are available in three configurations: classic, micro and solid.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P46_S2	Physicians select crown sizes and configurations based on several case criteria, including reference vessel size, lesion length and degree of stenosis, stenosis morphology, and anatomy tortuosity.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P46_S3	Physicians often use the classic or micro crown configuration in small, more tortuous vessels or when less aggressive sanding is desired.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	The solid crown configuration is designed with a tapered, leading edge for frontal sanding, which can be used in tight calcified disease.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	The Peripheral OAS is available with a 1.50 millimeter and 2.00 millimeter classic crown, and a 1.25 millimeter, 1.50 millimeter and 2.00 millimeter solid crown configuration.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P47_S2	There is also a 1.25 millimeter micro crown available with the Diamondback 360 Peripheral device, which allows physicians options to treat very small arteries in the lower leg and foot.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P47_S3	Catheter lengths are 145 centimeters and 60 centimeters, which address procedural approach and target lesion locations both above and below the knee and ankle.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P47_S4	Varying catheter lengths allow physicians options to treat via retrograde pedal approach in addition to the common femoral artery access point.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	The Peripheral OAS is versatile, and by adjusting the speed in conjunction with crown selection, multiple lesions and vessel sizes can be treated.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	The crown for the Coronary OAS is available in one configuration: 1.25 millimeter classic.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	Centrifugal force propels the crown outward against the arterial wall as the crown rotates.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	This force is offset by the counterforce exerted by the arterial wall, and the guidewire.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	Normal arteries are compliant and have the ability to expand and contract as needed to supply blood flow.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	If the tissue is compliant, it flexes away, minimizing the engagement of the diamond-grit and protecting the integrity of the healthy tissue.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P51_S2	Diseased tissue is less flexible or non-compliant and provides resistance to the centrifugal force, which generates an opposing force that enables the diamond-coated crown to engage and sand the plaque.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P51_S3	The sanded plaque is broken down into particles generally smaller than circulating red blood cells that are washed away downstream with the patient's natural blood flow.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	Peripheral OAS testing performed in carbon blocks, animal and cadaver models showed:
1180145_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	greater than 99% of particles were smaller than the lumen of the capillaries (which provide the connection between the arterial and venous system).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	Coronary OAS testing performed in a carbon block model showed:
1180145_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	The small particle size and short treatment time minimizes the risk of vascular bed overload, or a saturation of the peripheral or coronary vessels with large particles, which may cause slow or reduced blood flow.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	The small size of the particles allows them to be naturally cleared from the blood via various types of white blood cells and macrophages.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	We believe the OAS offers the following key benefits:
1180145_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	Differential Sanding Reduces Risk of Adverse Events .
1180145_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	The OAS is designed to differentiate between hard, non-compliant plaque and soft, compliant arterial tissue.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	Arteries are composed of three tissue layers (from inside to out): the intima, media, and adventitia.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	The eccentrically mounted diamond-coated crown at the working end of the device engages and removes plaque from the artery wall with minimal likelihood of penetrating or damaging the fragile intima, or inner layer of the arterial wall because soft, compliant tissue flexes away from the crown.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	Furthermore, the OAS has rarely penetrated the media (middle) or adventitial (outer) layers of the artery's wall.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P59_S3	The Diamondback 360 Peripheral's perforation rate was 0.7% during our CONFIRM trial.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	Analysis by an independent pathology laboratory of more than 434 consecutive cross sections of porcine arteries treated with the Stealth 360 Peripheral revealed there was minimal to no damage, on average, to the media or associated lamina, which implies preservation of the media during treatment.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	Similarly, the perforation rate was 1.8% during our pivotal coronary ORBIT II trial, with 0.9% perforations device related.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P60_S2	Analysis by an independent core-lab of more than 443 patients enrolled in the ORBIT II Trial revealed 4 patients had a perforation after the OAS treatment and another 4 patients had a perforation after stent deployment, for a total of 8 perforations reported.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	The small size of the particles produced during sanding avoids the need for ancillary distal protection devices, commonly used with directional cutting atherectomy devices.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P61_S1	The small particulate size also significantly reduces the risk of macroembolization, or larger pieces of removed plaque capable of blocking blood flow downstream.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	Allows Continuous Blood Flow During Procedure.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	The OAS allows for continuous blood flow while orbiting.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P62_S2	Other devices may restrict blood flow due to the size of the catheter required or the use of distal protection devices, which could result in complications such as excessive heat and tissue damage.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	The Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS portfolio is uniquely compatible with 4 French ( Fr ) to 6Fr sheaths (1.25mm crowns - 4Fr, 1.5mm crowns - 5Fr, 2.00mm crowns - 6Fr).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	Centrifugal force enables the OAS to treat large vessels through small sheaths; for example, it can treat up to 5mm vessel through a 4Fr sheath.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	Smaller sheaths may be associated with less femoral bleeding, shortened post-procedure ambulation time and reduced radiation exposure.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P64_S2	In addition, the primary complication in peripheral interventions is a vascular access site complication.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P64_S3	Access site complications were shown to be 41.4% more frequent in procedures where 7Fr or 8Fr sheaths were used compared to 4Fr to 6Fr (4.5% vs. 3.2%, p 0.001).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P64_S4	Exchanging to a larger sheath has been shown to be the strongest predictor of bleeding complication during peripheral interventions.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	Efficacy Demonstrated for Both Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	Peripheral OAS - Our pivotal OASIS clinical trial was a prospective 20-center study that involved 124 patients with 201 lesions treated by the Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	Performance targets were established cooperatively with the FDA before the trial began.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P66_S2	Despite 55% of the lesions consisting of calcified plaque, the Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS successfully met the study endpoints.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P66_S3	Because the Predator 360 and Stealth 360 mechanism of action is identical to that of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS, no additional efficacy trials were required by the FDA for 510(k) clearance of either of those systems.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	Coronary OAS - Our pivotal ORBIT II coronary OAS trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OAS in treating de novo severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P67_S1	The trial met both the primary safety and efficacy endpoints by significant margins.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P67_S2	Preparation of severely calcified plaque with the Coronary OAS not only helped facilitate stent delivery, but also improved both peri-procedural and 30-day clinical outcomes compared with the outcomes of historic control subjects in this difficult-to-treat patient population.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	The pre-procedure mean minimal lumen diameter of 0.5 mm increased to 2.9 mm after the procedure.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	The primary safety endpoint was 89.6% freedom from 30-day MACE compared with the performance goal of 83%.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P68_S2	The primary efficacy endpoint (residual stenosis 50% post-stent without in-hospital major adverse cardiac events) was 88.9% compared with the performance goal of 82%.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P68_S3	Stent delivery was successful in 97.7% of cases; 50% stenosis was observed in 98.6% of subjects.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P68_S4	Low rates of in-hospital Q-wave myocardial infarction (0.7%), cardiac death (0.2%), and target vessel revascularization (0.7%) were reported, as well as 1-year outcomes with target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) (4.7%) and TLR in the drug-eluting stent subset (3.4%).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P68_S5	ORBIT II patients were tracked out to three years, demonstrating long term durable results with a low TLR rate of 7.8% and TLR in the drug eluting stent subset of 6.6%.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	Treats Difficult, Fibrotic and Calcified Lesions.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	The OAS enables physicians to remove plaque from long, fibrotic, calcified or bifurcated lesions, as well as lesions with softer plaque, in peripheral arteries both above and below the knee.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P70_S1	In the coronaries, the OAS enables physicians to treat complex, severely calcified lesions, enabling stent placement in these difficult to treat lesions.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P70_S2	To date, the Coronary OAS is the only FDA-approved device for treatment of severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	The orbiting action of the OAS removes the hard plaque in the artery by sanding, while the centrifugal motion of the eccentrically mounted crown creates pulsatile forces.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	Compliance change is achieved by sanding away superficial plaque, which also creates an open lumen, and by modification or fractionation of deeper plaque by delivering pulsatile forces into the vessel wall.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P71_S2	Together, these mechanistic components sufficiently remove or modify hard plaque, allowing for low pressure balloon inflation.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P71_S3	The orbital motion and speed of the eccentrically mounted crown increases, thus allowing for continuous reduction of plaque with pulsatile forces, as the opening of the lumen increases during the operation of the devices.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	The differential sanding of the OAS creates a smooth surface lumen, or channel, inside the vessel.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	We believe that the smooth lumens created by the device increase the velocity of blood flow and decrease the resistance to blood flow, which may decrease the potential for restenosis, or re-narrowing of the arteries.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	Physicians using the OAS employ techniques similar to those used in angioplasty, which are familiar to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists who are trained in endovascular techniques.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	The devices' simple user interfaces require minimal additional training.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	Single Access Site to Complete Treatment.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	Centrifugal force unique to OAS allows for a single access site to treat multiple lesions, in most cases.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P74_S2	In the coronary arteries, Coronary OAS is the only atherectomy device able to treat 2-4mm vessels with one device through a 6Fr radial approach.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P74_S3	In the peripheral vasculature, the OAS device is capable of treating multiple lesions in multiple arteries through a single access site, thus reducing the need for multiple devices or the need for multiple access sites.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	Because the particles of plaque sanded away are of such small sizes, the OAS does not require a collection reservoir that needs to be repeatedly emptied or cleaned during the procedure, which adds time and cost to the procedure.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	The unique OAS mechanism of action used in both the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS can be used to treat multiple anatomic locations.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	Below-the-Knee and Behind-the-Knee Peripheral Artery Disease.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P77_S1	Arteries below and behind the knee are small in diameter and may be diffusely diseased, calcified or both.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P77_S2	Reaching and treating these small vessels requires a low profile, which most competitive devices do not offer.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	The Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS is effective in treating those vessels, as demonstrated in our CALCIUM 360 randomized clinical trial, where 100% of the lesions treated with the Peripheral OAS were located below the knee.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P78_S1	The Peripheral OAS offers a shorter shaft length (60cm), a smaller profile and a more flexible shaft than the predecessors for improved ease of use, and includes a 4 French catheter that enables physicians to access lesions below-the-knee using retrograde access (access through the ankle or foot).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	Arteries above the knee are typically longer, straighter and wider than below-the-knee vessels.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P79_S1	Plaque in these arteries may also be diffuse, fibrotic and calcific.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	Physicians often use higher speeds or larger crown sizes of our products to treat lesions above the knee.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	The individuals more at risk for being diagnosed with CAD are those that are suffering from high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, or have a family history of heart disease.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	Once CAD occurs, a fatty material called plaque builds up on the walls of arteries that supply blood to the heart.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P82_S1	The plaque buildup causes the arteries to harden and narrow (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P83_S0	The Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS is the only atherectomy device indicated for severe coronary calcium.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P84_S0	The OAS has a short treatment time, typically less than two minutes in coronary procedures.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P85_S0	Single Crown Can Treat Various Lumen Sizes Limiting Hospital Inventory Costs.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P86_S0	The OAS orbital mechanism of action allows one device to treat various diameter lumens inside the artery.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P86_S1	Adjusting the rotational speed of the crown changes the orbit to create the desired lumen diameter, thereby potentially avoiding the need to use multiple catheters of different sizes to treat multiple lesions.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P87_S0	Single Access Site May Reduce Procedural Time.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P87_S1	Since the physician can treat multiple arteries through a single access site, this reduces the risk of bleeding complications that can occur during arterial access, ultimately reducing patient recovery time.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P88_S0	Many of the patients treated with the Peripheral OAS have advanced PAD and suffer from Critical Limb Ischemia.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P88_S1	These patients often have complex, calcified lesions in their lower leg, which are challenging to access and treat using the traditional femoral artery access site.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P88_S2	If left untreated, these cases may result in lower limb amputation.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P88_S3	CSI s family of 1.25mm Peripheral OASs with 4Fr compatibility allows for more options to treat those lesions by providing a low-profile system that is fully compatible with alternative access sites in the foot or ankle.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P88_S4	Smaller sheaths have been shown to reduce procedure times and decrease complications.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P89_S0	Our goal is to be the leading provider of minimally invasive solutions for the treatment of peripheral and coronary artery disease.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P89_S1	The key elements of our strategy include:
1180145_16_ITEM1_P90_S0	Drive Adoption through Our Direct Sales Organization, Medical Education and Key Opinion Leaders.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P90_S1	We expect to continue to drive adoption of the OAS through our direct sales force in both hospital and office-based lab settings, which targets interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, and interventional radiologists.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P90_S2	As a key element of our strategy, we focus on educating physicians about the disease state and our clinical data, and training physicians regarding the proper use and application of OAS technology through physician faculty, our direct sales force and through seminars where physician industry leaders discuss case studies and treatment techniques using the devices.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P91_S0	Collect Additional Clinical Evidence on Safety, Effectiveness and Economic Benefits of the OAS.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P91_S1	Physicians and payers are increasingly requesting clinical and economic evidence to allow them to make decisions regarding optimal treatment of patients.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P91_S2	We are focused on collecting clinical and economic evidence to demonstrate the advantages of the OAS in treating complex disease states such as peripheral and coronary artery disease.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P91_S3	We believe that the clinical advantages and cost effectiveness of our OAS technology will help drive physician utilization of the OAS and sustain ongoing reimbursement coverage for our devices.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P92_S0	Enhance OAS and Expand Product Portfolio within the Market for Treatment of Peripheral and Coronary Arteries.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P93_S0	In addition to enhancing the OAS, we have expanded our product portfolio.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P93_S1	We offer multiple accessory devices for use with the OAS.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P93_S2	We are continuing product development to further expand our portfolio of PAD and CAD treatment solutions.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P94_S0	CE Mark was granted for the Stealth 360 device in October 2014 and we have applied for regulatory approval for the next generation coronary OAS device in Japan.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P94_S1	We are evaluating options for international expansion to maximize the coronary and peripheral market opportunities.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P94_S2	Sales channels will be based on specific country dynamics.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P94_S3	As a result, distributors, including potential strategic partners, and direct sales channels are being evaluated.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P95_S0	In addition to adding to our product portfolio through internal development efforts, we intend to continue to explore the acquisition of other product lines, technologies or companies that may leverage our sales force or complement our strategic objectives.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P95_S1	We also intend to explore distribution agreements, licensing transactions, and other strategic partnerships.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P96_S0	We continue to study the most challenging patient populations and are committed to providing relevant clinical evidence that enables physicians to select and utilize the best treatment options for their patients.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P97_S0	A total of 5,698 subjects (4,740 PAD and 958 CAD) have been enrolled in our clinical studies as of June 30, 2016.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P97_S1	Our clinical studies incorporate rigorous long-term clinical and healthcare economic data that are critical to improving patient care and ongoing healthcare changes.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P97_S2	Both the PAD and CAD studies illustrate the versatility of our technology and our focus on improving the standard of care.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P98_S0	We have completed numerous clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Peripheral OAS, including our OASIS (pivotal study for clearance of the Peripheral OAS), CONFIRM post market registries (CONFIRM I, II, and III), CALCIUM 360 , COMPLIANCE 360 , and TRUTH.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P98_S1	The results of these studies consistently demonstrate that the Peripheral OAS provides predictable, repeatable and durable results that differentiate it from other PAD treatments.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P99_S0	We recently completed enrollment in the LIBERTY 360 study and began enrollment in the OPTIMIZE BTK study.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P100_S0	The following PAD clinical studies were completed or in process during fiscal 2016:
1180145_16_ITEM1_P101_S0	This post-market, prospective, single-arm study utilized intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) imaging and angiography to assess procedural outcomes in twenty-five subjects with symptomatic PAD treated with orbital atherectomy and adjunctive balloon angioplasty.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P101_S1	The independent IVUS Core Lab analysis demonstrated that the orbital atherectomy device modified the calcified component of the plaque burden.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P101_S2	At twelve months, the target lesion revascularization rate was 8.2%.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P101_S3	The final TRUTH study results were published in Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (October 2015).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P102_S0	This prospective, observational, multi-center clinical study will evaluate the procedural and long-term clinical, quality of life and economic outcomes of endovascular device interventions, including orbital atherectomy, for the treatment of PAD.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P102_S1	We expect the results from this study to increase our understanding of the clinical and economic outcomes of endovascular treatment for PAD patients, including those with the most advanced form of the disease (Rutherford 6).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P103_S0	Enrollment of over 1,200 subjects at 51 sites in the United States was recently completed.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P103_S1	LIBERTY 360 baseline demographic data for the first 600 patients was presented in a late-breaking presentation at the International Symposium on Endovascular Therapy (February 2016).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P103_S2	The LIBERTY 360 interim demographic analysis showed that the prevalence of diabetes and renal disease increased significantly as the PAD disease state progresses from Rutherford 2-3 (Claudicant) to Rutherford 6 (CLI).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P103_S3	In addition, the data seems to indicate racial disparity in PAD/CLI treatment, which warrants further investigation.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P104_S0	LIBERTY 360 subjects will be followed for up to five years.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P105_S0	This post-market, multi-center, randomized clinical study conducted in Europe will evaluate the acute and long-term clinical outcomes of orbital atherectomy with adjunctive drug-coated balloon ( DCB ) angioplasty versus DCB angioplasty alone in PAD patients with calcified, below-the-knee lesions.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P105_S1	Fifty evaluable subjects will be enrolled in OPTIMIZE BTK and will be followed for up to two years.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P106_S0	CAD, the most common form of heart disease, continues to affect more patients worldwide.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P107_S0	Percutaneous coronary intervention of calcified lesions is associated with procedural complications, stent malapposition, and high revascularization and MACE rates.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P108_S0	We have conducted two clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Coronary OAS Classic Crown device: the ORBIT I feasibility study and the ORBIT II pivotal study.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P108_S1	The Coronary OAS Micro Crown device is currently under investigation in the COAST study.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P109_S0	The following CAD clinical studies were completed or in process during fiscal 2016:
1180145_16_ITEM1_P110_S0	This prospective, multi-center, single-arm Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE ) study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Coronary OAS Classic Crown in treating de novo , severely calcified coronary lesions and enrolled 443 subjects at 49 US sites.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P110_S1	Two year ORBIT II study results were recently published in Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (April 2016).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P110_S2	The final ORBIT II 3-year data was presented at the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions conference in a featured clinical research presentation (May 2016).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P110_S3	The overall 3-year MACE rate was 23.5%, including 6.7% cardiac death, 10.2% target vessel revascularization, and 11.2% myocardial infarction.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P111_S0	This prospective, single-arm, multi-center, post-market study will evaluate coronary flow reserve after treatment with the Coronary OAS Classic Crown and stenting of de novo, severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P111_S1	Enrollment of the fifteen subjects was completed in May 2016.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P111_S2	Study results are pending following completion of analysis.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P112_S0	This prospective, single-arm, multi-center, global IDE study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the next-generation Coronary OAS Micro Crown in treating patients with severely calcified lesions.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P112_S1	CSI completed COAST enrollment of 100 patients, including 74 patients at 12 sites in the United States and 26 patients at five sites in Japan, in July 2015.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P112_S2	The 30-day study results were presented at the Cardiovascular Research Technologies conference in a late-breaking presentation (February 2016).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P112_S3	In the COAST study, successful stent delivery was achieved in 99.0% of the subjects and 30-day freedom from MACE was 85.0%.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P113_S0	Our clinical portfolio is expanding as we develop future studies to answer difficult questions about PAD and CAD treatment.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P113_S1	A number of upcoming clinical studies are in the development phase and will begin enrolling in the near future.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P113_S2	Our clinical research continues to highlight the safety and efficacy of the OAS and current and new research illustrates our versatility in the emerging vascular market.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P114_S0	Our product research and development activities are dedicated to the development and commercialization of products that serve the peripheral and coronary vascular disease space, with emphasis towards high margin products and complex arterial disease states treated by our primary customers.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P114_S1	The focus and value proposition of our products is to enable positive acute and long-term clinical outcomes, with efficiency and predictability, in challenging patient subsets.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P115_S0	Research and development resources have been strategically allocated between opportunities that maximize the clinical effectiveness and user satisfaction of our OAS product line and the development of additional products that offer portfolio diversification and incremental revenue opportunities.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P116_S0	Specific to the peripheral vascular disease market, we will continue our commitment to patients suffering from CLI through a breadth of above-the-knee and below-the-knee differentiated products that treat or uniquely expand the ability of our devices to treat obstructive lesions throughout the leg and foot.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P116_S1	Most recently, we launched the Diamondback 360 Low Profile Peripheral, a line of next generation low profile orbital atherectomy devices that enable physicians to intervene through 4Fr and 5Fr access sheaths.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P116_S2	Low profile devices offer numerous benefits, including a reduction in access site complications, improved device deliverability, compatibility with alternative access sites and a reduction in post-procedure time to ambulation.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P117_S0	Specific to the coronary vascular disease market, we are building a portfolio of differentiated products that are used to treat complex CAD.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P117_S1	We are currently seeking FDA and Japanese PMDA approval of a next generation coronary OAS that utilizes a micro crown design and distal tip sanding surface that aid in crossing sub-total occlusion lesions.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P118_S0	Emphasis in both franchises is placed on novel and differentiated devices that address unmet or under-met clinical or technical needs.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P119_S0	Research and development expenses for the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 were $25.9 million , $31.0 million and $21.1 million , respectively.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P120_S0	We market and sell our products through a direct sales force in the United States.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P120_S1	Revenues for the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 were $178.2 million , $181.5 million and $136.6 million , respectively.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P121_S0	We have targeted sales and marketing efforts to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists with experience using similar catheter-based procedures, such as angioplasty, stenting, and cutting or laser atherectomy.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P122_S0	Peer-to-peer education is also a key element of our sales strategy.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P123_S0	We target our marketing efforts to practitioners through medical conferences, seminars, peer-reviewed journals and marketing materials.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P123_S1	Our sales and marketing program focuses on:
1180145_16_ITEM1_P124_S0	developing relationships with key opinion leaders.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P125_S0	We use internally-manufactured and externally-sourced components to manufacture the OAS.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P125_S1	Most of the externally-sourced components are available from multiple suppliers; however, certain key components, including the diamond-grit-coated crown and our ViperSlide Lubricant, are single sourced.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P125_S2	We have strategies and arrangements in place for procuring our key components from alternative suppliers in the event that one or more of our single source suppliers were to discontinue supplying us with a key component.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P125_S3	We assemble the shaft, crown and handle components on-site, and test, pack, seal and label the finished assembly before sending the packaged product to a contract sterilization facility.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P125_S4	Upon return from the sterilizer, the product is held in inventory prior to shipping to our customers.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P126_S0	We are located in a new, 125,000-square-foot corporate headquarters in Minnesota.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P126_S1	This custom-designed building has space for more than 500 employees and contains dedicated research and development, training and education, and manufacturing facilities.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P126_S2	Depending on staffing, the new facility has the capacity to produce in excess of 75,000 devices per shift annually.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P126_S3	The finished goods storage has capacity for approximately 20,000 devices and more than 500 saline infusion pumps, as well as other accessory products.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P127_S0	Our Pearland, Texas facility is 46,000 square feet and includes a custom-built clean room and production space for future expansion of value-add processes, including machining and electronics assembly.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P127_S1	The facility, when fully staffed and equipped, also has the capacity to produce approximately 75,000 devices per shift annually.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P127_S2	This facility has finished goods storage capacity for greater than 15,000 devices and other accessory products and over 500 saline infusion pumps.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P128_S0	We believe that our facilities in Minnesota and Texas will provide adequate production, assembly, and warehousing capacity for the foreseeable future.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P129_S0	We are registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P129_S1	We have opted to maintain quality assurance and quality management certifications to enable us to market our products in the member states of the European Union ( EU ), the European Free Trade Association and countries that have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements with the EU.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P129_S2	We are ISO 13485:2003 certified, and our renewal is due by December 2018.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P129_S3	Under these registrations, our plants are audited by the FDA and our Notified Body for the EU CE Mark.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P129_S4	Our Stealth 360 has received CE Mark.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P129_S5	We are registered as a Foreign Medical Device Manufacturer in Japan and our registration certificate renewal is due by June 2021.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P130_S0	Third-party payors, including private insurers, and government insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, pay for a significant portion of patient care provided in the United States.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P130_S1	The single largest payor in the United States is the Medicare program, a federal governmental health insurance program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P130_S2	Medicare covers certain medical care expenses for eligible elderly and disabled individuals, including a large percentage of the population with PAD and CAD who could be treated with the OAS.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P130_S3	In addition, private insurers often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P130_S4	Consequently, Medicare's coverage and reimbursement policies are important to our operations.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P131_S0	CMS has established Medicare reimbursement codes describing atherectomy products and procedures using atherectomy products.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P131_S1	We believe that physicians and hospitals that treat PAD and CAD with the respective OAS will generally be eligible to receive reimbursement from Medicare, as well as private insurers, for the cost of the single-use catheter and the physician's services.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P132_S0	The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P132_S1	Our OAS devices compete with a variety of other products or devices for the treatment of vascular disease, including stents, balloon angioplasty catheters and atherectomy catheters, as well as products used in vascular surgery.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P133_S0	Laboratories, Boston Scientific, Cook Medical, Johnson Johnson, BARD, and Medtronic.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P133_S1	We also compete against manufacturers of atherectomy catheters including, among others, Medtronic, Spectranetics, Boston Scientific and Philips, as well as manufacturers that may enter the market due to the increasing demand for treatment of vascular disease.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P133_S2	Other competitors include pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs for the treatment of PAD and CAD and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral and coronary bypass procedures.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P134_S0	We are not aware of any competing high-speed rotational atherectomy systems either currently on the market or in development that also generate an orbital motion with an eccentric solid abrasive crown to create lumens with diameters that are larger than the diameter of the abrasive crown itself.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P135_S0	Because of the size of the peripheral opportunities, competitors and potential competitors have historically dedicated significant resources to aggressively promote their products.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P135_S1	We believe that our Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS compete primarily on the basis of:
1180145_16_ITEM1_P136_S0	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and other intellectual property laws, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P136_S1	As of June 2016, we held 53 issued U.S. patents and have 52 U.S. patent applications pending, as well as 276 issued or granted foreign patents and 158 foreign patent applications, each of which corresponds to aspects of our U.S. patents and applications.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P136_S2	Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2016 and 2032, and our most important patents, U.S. Patent No. 6,494,890 and two key design patents covering our eccentric abrasive crown technology, are due to expire on June 1, 2019, February 16, 2024 and December 29, 2023, respectively, though we will pursue patent term extensions on the basis of regulatory delay where appropriate.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P136_S3	In addition, we have many additional patents relating to our core technology currently pending in the USPTO, which will extend our key covered subject matter and coverage dates significantly.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P136_S4	Our issued patents and patent applications relate primarily to the design and operation of interventional atherectomy devices, including the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P136_S5	These patents and applications include claims covering key aspects of orbital atherectomy devices, including the design, manufacture and therapeutic use of certain atherectomy abrasive heads, drive shafts, control systems, handles and couplings.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P136_S6	As we continue to research and develop our atherectomy technology, we intend to file additional U.S. and foreign patent applications related to the design, manufacture and therapeutic uses of atherectomy devices.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P136_S7	In addition, we hold 18 registered U.S. trademarks, 12 registered marks in the Madrid Protocol with protection granted within at least one of Australia, Europe, China, Japan and Mexico, six registered marks in Europe, five registered marks in Canada, five registered marks in Mexico, and eight registered marks in Hong Kong.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P136_S8	We have three trademark applications pending in the U.S., eight trademark applications pending in Canada and 12 trademark applications pending in India.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P137_S0	We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P137_S1	We seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P137_S2	Agreements with our employees also forbid them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P137_S3	We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P138_S0	Governmental authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local levels and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of medical devices such as the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P139_S0	Failure to obtain approval to market our products under development and to meet the ongoing requirements of these regulatory authorities could prevent us from marketing and continuing to market our products.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P140_S0	The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( FDCA ) and the FDA s implementing regulations govern medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post market surveillance.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P140_S1	Medical devices and their manufacturers are also subject to inspection by the FDA.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P140_S2	The FDCA, supplemented by other federal and state laws, also provides civil and criminal penalties for violations of its provisions.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P141_S0	We manufacture and market medical devices that are regulated by the FDA, comparable state agencies and regulatory bodies in other countries.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P142_S0	Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P143_S0	The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization are premarket notification (also called 510(k) clearance) and PMA.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P144_S0	The type of marketing authorization applicable to a device - 510(k) clearance or PMA - is generally linked to classification of the device.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P145_S0	The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the extent of control deemed necessary to ensure the device s safety and effectiveness.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P145_S1	Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P145_S2	Class I devices are deemed to pose the least risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling, premarket notification, and adherence to the FDA s current good manufacturing practice requirements, as reflected in its Quality System Regulation ( QSR ).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P145_S3	Class II devices are intermediate risk devices that are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post market surveillance.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P145_S4	Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, and include life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, and devices not substantially equivalent to a device that is already legally marketed.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P146_S0	Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from FDA.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P146_S1	Class I and Class II devices that have not been exempted are eligible for marketing through the 510(k) clearance pathway.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P146_S2	By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require PMA prior to commercial marketing.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P146_S3	The PMA process is generally more stringent, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) clearance process.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P147_S0	To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device legally marketed in the United States.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P147_S1	A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P147_S2	A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P148_S0	Generally, the 510(k) clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a year or more.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P149_S0	After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA (if the device as modified is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P149_S1	The determination as to whether new authorization is needed is initially left to the manufacturer; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P149_S2	The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P150_S0	We received 510(k) clearance for use of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral as a therapy in patients with PAD in the United States on August 22, 2007.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P150_S1	We received additional 510(k) clearances for the control unit used with the Diamondback 360 Peripheral on October 25, 2007 and for the solid crown version of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral on November 9, 2007.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P150_S2	We were granted 510(k) clearance of the Predator 360 in March 2009 and Stealth 360 in March 2011.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P150_S3	We received 510(k) clearance of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral 1.25 Micro in November 2013 and the Diamondback 360 60cm Peripheral in February 2014.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P150_S4	The Diamondback 360 Low Profile Peripheral received FDA clearance in April 2015.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P150_S5	We received clearance of the ViperWire Advance Flex Tip Guide Wire in June 2015.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P150_S6	The Diamondback 360 1.50 Peripheral and Diamondback 360 2.00 Peripheral were granted 510(k) clearance in October 2015.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P151_S0	A PMA application requires the payment of significant user fees and must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P152_S0	After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P152_S1	During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P152_S2	Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P152_S3	In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with the FDA s QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P153_S0	FDA review of a PMA application is required by statute to take no longer than 180 days, although the process typically takes significantly longer, and may require several years to complete.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P153_S1	The FDA can delay, limit, or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
1180145_16_ITEM1_P154_S0	changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P155_S0	If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P155_S1	When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P155_S2	If the FDA s evaluation of the PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny PMA or issue a not approvable letter.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P155_S3	The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA application.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P155_S4	Even if a PMA application is approved, the FDA may approve the device with an indication that is narrower or more limited than originally sought.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P155_S5	The agency can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of the device as a condition of approval, or impose post approval requirements such as continuing evaluation and periodic reporting on the safety, efficacy, and reliability of the device for its intended use.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P156_S0	New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P156_S1	PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P157_S0	The FDA granted unconditional IDE approval in April 2010 to begin the ORBIT II coronary trial in the United States.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P157_S1	This pivotal trial was set up in two phases:
1180145_16_ITEM1_P157_S2	Phase I allowed us to enroll up to 100 patients at as many as 50 U.S. sites, and Phase II allowed us to expand the trial to the full complement of 429 patients.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P157_S3	In May 2011, we received approval from the FDA to complete enrollment of 429 patients in our ORBIT II clinical trial for a coronary application for the Diamondback 360, which followed the FDA s review of data from the first 50 cases in the ORBIT II trial.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P157_S4	In July 2012, we received approval from the FDA to include the new electric coronary device (similar to Stealth 360 technology used in PAD and customized specifically for the coronary application), which improves ease of use.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P157_S5	The FDA required 100 enrollments with the new electric coronary device and would have allowed up to 50 additional patients in the trial, as needed, to achieve that enrollment level.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P157_S6	A total of 443 patients were enrolled in the trial.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P158_S0	In March 2013, we completed submission of our PMA application to the FDA for our OAS to treat calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P158_S1	In October 2013, we received approval from the FDA to market the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries and subsequently commenced a controlled commercial launch of the Coronary OAS.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P158_S2	In 2014, we initiated the COAST study, an IDE clinical trial, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the next-generation Coronary OAS in treating patients with severely calcified lesions.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P158_S3	We completed COAST enrollment of 100 patients, including 74 patients at 12 sites in the United States and 26 patients at five sites in Japan, in July 2015.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P159_S0	Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P159_S1	These trials generally require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P159_S2	The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P159_S3	The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P159_S4	Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P160_S0	FDA approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P160_S1	With certain exceptions, changes made to an investigational plan after an IDE is approved must be submitted in an IDE supplement and approved by FDA (and by governing institutional review boards when appropriate) prior to implementation.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P161_S0	All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with regulations and requirements collectively known as Good Clinical Practice.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P161_S1	Good clinical practices include the FDA s IDE regulations, which describe the conduct of clinical trials with medical devices, including the recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of sponsors and investigators, and labeling of investigational devices.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P161_S2	They also prohibit promotion, test marketing or commercialization of an investigational device and any representation that such a device is safe or effective for the purposes being investigated.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P161_S3	Good clinical practices also include the FDA s regulations for institutional review board approval and for protection of human subjects (such as informed consent), as well as disclosure of financial interests by clinical investigators.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P162_S0	Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P162_S1	The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P162_S2	The commencement or completion of any clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application or clearance of a premarket notification for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:
1180145_16_ITEM1_P163_S0	the FDA concludes that the trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P164_S0	After a device is cleared or approved for use and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P165_S0	product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device that may present a risk to health.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P166_S0	In addition, the FDA may require a company to conduct post market surveillance studies or order it to establish and maintain a system for tracking its products through the chain of distribution to the patient level.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P167_S0	Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions:
1180145_16_ITEM1_P168_S0	We and our contract manufacturers, specification developers and suppliers are also required to manufacture our products in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements set forth in the QSR.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P169_S0	The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing and record keeping.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P169_S1	The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P169_S2	If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers is not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to clear or approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P169_S3	Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P170_S0	Our operations are directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the FDCA, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P170_S1	These laws may impact, among other things, our sales, marketing, education and clinical programs.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P170_S2	In addition, these laws require us to screen individuals and other companies, suppliers and vendors in order to ensure that they are not debarred by the federal government and, therefore, prohibited from doing business in the healthcare industry.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P171_S0	The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P171_S1	Several courts have interpreted the statute s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P172_S0	The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P172_S1	Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P173_S0	The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P173_S1	Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P174_S0	In addition to the laws described above, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P175_S0	The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P175_S1	The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P176_S0	On May 8, 2014, we received a letter from the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Western District of North Carolina (the DOJ ) stating that it is investigating us to determine whether we had violated the False Claims Act.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P176_S1	On June 28, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the United States of America, acting through the DOJ and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (the OIG ), and Travis Thams, who filed the qui tam complaint underlying the DOJ s investigation (the Civil Action ), to resolve the investigation by the DOJ and the Civil Action, with no admission of liability.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P176_S2	In connection with the resolution of this matter, we entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement with the OIG.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P176_S3	See Item 3 of this Form 10-K for additional information on this matter.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P177_S0	The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, and certain state laws require persons to collect and report certain data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P177_S1	It is widely anticipated that public reporting under the Sunshine Act and implementing Open Payment regulations will result in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P178_S0	Voluntary industry codes, federal guidance documents and a variety of state laws address the tracking and reporting of marketing practices relative to gifts given and other expenditures made to doctors and other healthcare professionals.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P178_S1	In addition to impacting our marketing and educational programs, our internal business processes are and will continue to be affected by the numerous legal requirements and regulatory guidance at the state, federal and industry levels.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P179_S0	International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P179_S1	The time required to obtain approval in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P179_S2	For example, the primary regulatory environment in Europe with respect to medical devices is that of the EU, which includes most of the major countries in Europe.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P179_S3	Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the EU with respect to medical devices.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P180_S0	The EU has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P180_S1	Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the EU, although actual implementation of these directives may vary on a country-by-country basis.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P181_S0	The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of submission of a design dossier, self-assessment by the manufacturer, a third-party assessment, and review of the design dossier by a Notified Body.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P181_S1	This third-party assessment generally consists of an audit of the manufacturer s quality system and manufacturing site, as well as review of the technical documentation used to support application of the CE Mark to one s product and possibly specific testing of the manufacturer s product.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P181_S2	An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the EU is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the EU.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P182_S0	As noted above, in July 2016, we submitted an application to Japan's Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency ( PMDA ) for approval of our Coronary OAS Micro Crown.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P182_S1	Pending approval, Japan would become the first international market for any CSI product.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P182_S2	As part of our anticipated Japan commercialization process we will be subject to the requirements of the Japanese Act on Securing Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, Regenerative and Cellular Therapy Products, Gene Therapy Products, and Cosmetics (the PMD Act ).
1180145_16_ITEM1_P182_S3	Our quality management system and products will be subject to review and examination by PMDA and subject to approval and enforcement by Japan s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P182_S4	The critical suppliers named in our application will also be subject to this review and examination for the activities they perform for us.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P183_S0	Non-compliance with the PMD Act could result in revocation or suspension of our license, revocation of approvals, and criminal sanctions such as fines and/or imprisonment.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P184_S0	In addition, any international expansion, operations and sales that we undertake will require us to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions and with U.S. and foreign export control, trade embargo and custom laws.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P185_S0	Our operations are subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P185_S1	We are currently classified and licensed as a Very Small Quantity Hazardous Waste Generator within Ramsey County, Minnesota.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P185_S2	There are no regulated wastes requiring licensing in our Texas facility.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P186_S0	As of June 30, 2016 , we had 581 employees, including 130 employees in manufacturing, 323 employees in sales and marketing, 65 employees in general and administrative, and 63 employees in research and development, all of which are full-time employees.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P186_S1	None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P187_S0	Scott R. Ward, President and Chief Executive Officer.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P187_S1	Mr. Ward has been a member of our Board of Directors since 2013 and has served as Chairman of our Board of Directors since November 2014.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P187_S2	Mr. Ward served as our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer commencing in November 2015, and in August 2016, Mr. Ward was appointed as our regular full-time President and Chief Executive Officer.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P188_S0	Since 2013, Mr. Ward has been one of the Managing Directors at SightLine Partners.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P188_S1	Following his appointment as our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ward will continue to be a Managing Director of Sightline Opportunity Management Fund II, LLC and may provide limited advisory and consulting services to Sightline Partners in this capacity.

1180145_16_ITEM1_P195_S0	Paul Koehn, Senior Vice President of Manufacturing and Operations.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P195_S1	Mr. Koehn joined us in March 2007 as Director of Manufacturing and was promoted to Vice President of Quality and Manufacturing in October 2007.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P195_S2	In August 2011, Mr. Koehn became Vice President of Quality and Operations and in September 2013, he became Senior Vice President of Quality and Operations.

1180145_16_ITEM1_P196_S0	Alexander Rosenstein, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P196_S1	Mr. Rosenstein joined us in September 2014 as Corporate Legal and Compliance Counsel, became Corporate Secretary in November 2014, and was promoted to General Counsel in March 2015.
1180145_16_ITEM1_P196_S2	From October 2005 to September 2014, Mr. Rosenstein was an attorney at Fredrikson Byron, P.A., which provides legal services to us from time to time.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We have a history of net losses and a short commercialization experience, and we are likely to continue to incur losses.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We are not profitable and have incurred net losses in each fiscal year since our formation in 1989.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In particular, we had net losses of $ 56.0 million , $32.8 million , and $35.3 million for the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	As of June 30, 2016 , we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $327.4 million .
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	We commenced commercial sales of the Peripheral OAS in September 2007 and the Coronary OAS in October 2013, and our short commercialization experience makes it difficult for us to predict future performance.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P1_S4	We expect to continue to incur significant expenses for sales and marketing, research and development, and manufacturing as we continue to commercialize the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS and develop and commercialize future versions of the Peripheral OAS, the Coronary OAS, and any future products.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Additionally, we expect that our general and administrative expenses may increase to support business growth.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P1_S6	We instituted a number of cost reduction initiatives in the year ended June 30, 2016, which, combined with revenue growth, may reduce our net losses in future periods.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P1_S7	However, if we are unable to balance revenue growth and cost management, our operating losses are likely to continue.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We may be unable to sustain our historical revenue growth.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Other than a 4.9% decline in revenue from sales of our Peripheral OAS in the most recent fiscal year, our revenue from sales of our OAS devices has grown in each of the fiscal years since we began commercialization in September 2007.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our ability to increase our revenues in future periods will depend on our ability to increase sales of the OAS devices and improved products we introduce, which will, in turn, depend in part on our success in growing our customer base and reorders from those customers.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We may not be able to generate, sustain or increase revenues on a quarterly or annual basis.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	If we cannot achieve or sustain revenue growth for an extended period, our financial results will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Economic conditions may adversely affect our business.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Adverse worldwide economic conditions may negatively impact our business.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	A significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of our customers could cause unfavorable trends in their purchases and also in our receivable collections and additional allowances may be required, which could adversely affect our operating results.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Adverse worldwide economic conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers' ability to provide us with materials and components, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Peripheral OAS, the Coronary OAS and future products may never achieve broad market acceptance.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The Peripheral OAS, the Coronary OAS, and future products we may develop may never gain broad market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The degree of market acceptance of any of our products will depend on a number of factors, including:
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	our reputation among physicians and hospitals.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Failure of the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS to significantly penetrate current or new markets would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our customers may not be able to achieve adequate reimbursement for using the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS, which could affect the acceptance of our products and cause our business to suffer.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved medical devices and procedures is uncertain.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The commercial success of our products is substantially dependent on whether third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement for the use of such products and related services are available.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We expect our products to continue to be purchased by hospitals and other providers who will then seek reimbursement from various public and private third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers, for the services provided to patients.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	While third-party payors are currently providing reimbursement for our products, we can give no assurance that these third-party payors will continue to provide adequate reimbursement for use of the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS to permit hospitals and doctors to consider the products cost-effective for patients requiring treatment, or that current reimbursement levels for our products will continue.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	In addition, the overall amount of reimbursement available for PAD and CAD treatment could decrease in the future.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain sufficient reimbursement could cause our business to suffer.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement, and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for use of our products.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In order to position our products for acceptance by third-party payors, we may have to agree to lower prices than we might otherwise charge.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Governmental and private sector payors have instituted initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs using, for example, price regulation or controls and competitive pricing programs.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Some third-party payors also require demonstrated superiority, on the basis of randomized clinical trials, or pre-approval of coverage, for new or innovative devices or procedures before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such devices or procedures.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	It is uncertain whether our current products or any future products we may develop will be viewed as sufficiently cost-effective to warrant adequate coverage and reimbursement levels.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In addition, in June 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the United States of America, acting through the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina (the DOJ ) and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (the OIG ), and Travis Thams, and a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement with the OIG.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In the event of a breach of the Settlement Agreement or the Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could be excluded from participation in federal health care programs.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products is limited or not available, the acceptance of our products and, consequently, our business will be substantially harmed.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Healthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	There have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control healthcare costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system, some of which have been enacted into law, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Patient Act.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The Patient Act and any additional healthcare proposals and laws that may be enacted in the future could also limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The Patient Act and future healthcare legislation could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our financial performance may be adversely affected by medical device tax provisions in the health care reform legislation.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The imposition of the 2.3% medical device excise tax enacted as part of the Patient Act has adversely affected our financial results and has required, and will continue to require, us to identify ways to reduce spending in other areas or raise additional capital to offset the increased expense.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Although the excise tax has been suspended by Congress until the end of 2017, its status is unclear for 2018 and subsequent years.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We have not been able to pass along the cost of the tax to our customers or offset the cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting from the expansion of health insurance coverage and do not expect to be able to do so in the future.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Ongoing implementation of this legislation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We have limited data and experience regarding the safety and efficacy of the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Any long-term data that is generated may not be positive or consistent with our limited short-term data, which would affect market acceptance of these products.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Because our technology is relatively new in the treatment of PAD and CAD, we have performed clinical trials only with limited patient populations.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	predict long-term clinical benefits or reveal long-term adverse effects.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We are conducting and developing several clinical trials, and there are substantial risks and uncertainties involved in these trials.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We must devote substantial resources to our clinical trials, clinical trials often take several years to develop and conduct, there are difficulties involved in locating sites and patients to participate in our clinical trials, and the results of every trial are uncertain until the trial is completed.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	These uncertainties could adversely impact our financial results, our reputation and the reputation of our products.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Clinical trials conducted with the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS have involved procedures performed by physicians who are very technically proficient.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Consequently, both short and long-term results reported in these studies may be significantly more favorable than typical results achieved by physicians, which could negatively impact market acceptance of the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS and materially harm our business.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We face significant competition, must innovate to stay competitive, and may be unable to sell the Peripheral OAS or the Coronary OAS at profitable levels.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The market for medical devices is highly competitive, dynamic and marked by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovation.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our ability to compete depends on our ability to innovate successfully, and, while certain barriers exist to entry into our market, we cannot assure that new entrants or existing competitors will not be able to develop products that compete directly with our products.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We compete against very large and well-known stent and balloon angioplasty device manufacturers, atherectomy catheter manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral and coronary bypass procedures.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P24_S3	We may have difficulty competing effectively with these competitors because of their well-established positions in the marketplace, significant financial and human capital resources, established reputations and worldwide distribution channels.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	develop more effective or less expensive products or technologies that render our technology or products obsolete or non-competitive.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We have encountered and expect to continue to encounter potential customers who, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to or prefer the products offered by these competitors.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In addition, increased consolidation in the healthcare industry has resulted in companies with greater market power, which increases competition for goods and services.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	If we are unable to compete successfully, our revenue will suffer.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Increased competition might lead to price reductions and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Competitive pressures may decrease the demand for our products and could adversely affect our financial results.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We have limited commercial manufacturing experience and could experience difficulty in producing the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS or may need to depend on third parties to manufacture the products.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We have limited experience in commercially manufacturing the Peripheral OAS, even less experience in commercially manufacturing the Coronary OAS and no experience manufacturing these products in the volume that we anticipate will be required if we achieve planned levels of commercial sales.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	As a result, we may not be able to develop and implement efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to manufacture the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS or future products in significant volumes, while meeting the legal, regulatory, quality, price, durability, engineering, design and production standards required to market our products successfully.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The forecasts of demand we use to determine order quantities and lead times for components purchased from outside suppliers may be incorrect.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our failure to obtain required components or subassemblies when needed and at a reasonable cost would adversely affect our business.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In addition, we may in the future need to depend upon third parties to manufacture the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS and future products.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Any difficulties in locating and hiring third-party manufacturers, or in the ability of third-party manufacturers to supply quantities of our products at the times and in the quantities we need, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We depend upon third-party suppliers, including single source suppliers to us and our customers, making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We rely on third-party suppliers to provide us with certain components of our products and to provide key components or supplies to our customers for use with our products.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We rely on single source suppliers for certain components of the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	In some cases, we do not have long-term supply agreements with, or guaranteed commitments from, our suppliers.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P33_S3	We depend on our suppliers to provide us and our customers with materials in a timely manner that meet our and their quality, quantity and cost requirements.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P33_S4	These suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand and our customers' demands.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Any supply interruption from our suppliers or failure to obtain additional suppliers for any of the components used in our products would limit our ability to manufacture our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We are dependent on our senior management team and highly skilled personnel, and our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain personnel necessary for our success.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We are highly dependent on our senior management and other key personnel.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Our success will depend on our ability to retain senior management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, including sales and marketing professionals, scientists, clinical specialists, engineers and other highly skilled personnel and to integrate current and additional personnel in all departments.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	The loss of members of our senior management, sales and marketing professionals, scientists, clinical and regulatory specialists and engineers could prevent us from achieving our objectives of continuing to grow our company.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P36_S3	We do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We have increased the size of our organization and may need to do so in the future, and we may experience difficulties managing growth.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	If we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business, our future revenue and operating results may be adversely affected.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We have significantly expanded the size of our organization over the past two years, particularly in the number of sales and marketing personnel, and may need to do so in the future.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The growth we may experience in the future may provide challenges to our organization, requiring us to also rapidly expand other aspects of our business, including our manufacturing operations.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Rapid expansion in personnel may result in less experienced people producing and selling our products, which could result in unanticipated costs and disruptions to our operations.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P38_S3	If we cannot scale and manage our business appropriately, our anticipated growth may be impaired and our financial results will suffer.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We intend to sell our products internationally in the future, but we may experience difficulties in obtaining approval to do so or in successfully marketing our products internationally even if approved.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Currently, all of our revenues are in the United States; however, we intend to sell internationally in the future and have commenced the process of seeking approval to do so in both Europe and Japan.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	There can be no guarantee that we will receive approval to sell our products internationally, nor can there be any guarantee that any sales would result even if such approval is received.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	In addition, we will incur substantial expenses in connection with international expansion.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Our inability to successfully enter international markets and manage business on a global scale could negatively affect our financial results.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We may require additional financing, and our failure to obtain additional financing when needed could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We may be dependent on additional financing to execute our business plan.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	In the event we need or desire additional financing, we may be unable to obtain it by borrowing money in the credit markets or raising money in the capital markets.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P42_S3	If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, we may terminate or delay the development of one or more of our products, or delay establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our stock price is volatile and subject to significant fluctuations.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Market prices for securities of early-stage pharmaceutical, medical device, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Our common stock traded as low as $7.50 and as high as $32.91 per share during the 12-month period ended June 30, 2016 .
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Moreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We currently are involved in litigation, and may face future claims, that could adversely affect our business and financial results, divert management s attention from our business, and subject us to significant liabilities.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	On February 12, 2016, a stockholder purporting to represent a class of persons who purchased our securities between September 12, 2011 and January 21, 2016 filed a lawsuit against us and certain of our officers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Paradis v. Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., et al., 2:16-cv-01011 (C.D. Cal.).
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	The lawsuit alleges that we made materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about our business, operational and financial performance, in violation of federal securities laws, relating to (1) alleged kickbacks to health care providers, (2) alleged off-label promotion of medical devices, and (3) alleged violations of the Food and Drug Administration s laws and regulations in connection with our medical devices.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	On March 4, 2016, a second stockholder filed a similar lawsuit against us and certain of our officers in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, Shoemaker v. Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P48_S3	The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the alleged class, interest, and attorney s fees and costs of litigation.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P48_S4	On April 12, 2016, four motions for appointment as lead plaintiff were filed in the Paradis action and three of the four proposed plaintiffs also filed a motion for appointment as lead plaintiff in the Shoemaker action.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P48_S5	On April 26, 2016, the Paradis action was voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs in favor of the Shoemaker action.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P48_S6	That same day, the Shoemaker court entered an order appointing the City of Miami Fire Fighters Police Officers Retirement Trust and the County Retirement Systems as Co-Lead Plaintiffs for representing the putative class.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	In addition, on May 10, 2016, a stockholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota naming us as nominal defendant and certain of our current and former executive officers and directors as defendants.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	The complaint alleges that these current and former executive officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties and unjustly enriched themselves by failing to oversee our business, operations, and prospects, relating to the alleged off-label promotion of medical devices and alleged kickbacks to health care providers.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P49_S2	The complaint includes claims for breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and waste of corporate assets.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Although we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously, we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	It is possible that they could cause us to incur substantial costs and that they could be resolved adversely to us, result in substantial damages, result in or be connected to additional claims, and divert management s attention and resources, any of which could harm our business.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P50_S2	While we maintain director and officer liability insurance, the amount of insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover these claims and other claims to which we may become subject, and the continued availability of this insurance cannot be assured.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition and could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by 5-percent shareholders that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We may have experienced an ownership change in the past and we may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock, some of which may be outside our control.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards or other pre-change tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitations.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	An interruption in or breach of security of our information or manufacturing systems could cause a loss of business or damage to our reputation.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We rely on information and communication systems in our manufacturing and in the conduct our business.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	If there is any failure or interruption of these systems, such an incident could cause failures or disruptions in our customer relationship systems or product manufacturing.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P56_S2	In addition, we could be subject to a cyber incident, such as an intentional attack or an unintentional event that involves a third party gaining unauthorized access to our systems, which could disrupt our operations, corrupt our data, or result in release of our confidential information.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P56_S3	The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or cyber incidents could cause a loss of business or damage to our reputation and have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our ability to market the Peripheral OAS in the United States is limited to use as a therapy in patients with PAD and our ability to market the Coronary OAS in the United States is limited to use as a therapy in patients with severely calcified CAD, and if we want to expand our marketing claims, we will need to file for additional FDA clearances or approvals and conduct further clinical trials, which would be expensive and time consuming and may not be successful.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We received FDA 510(k) clearances in the U.S. for use of the Peripheral OAS as a therapy in patients with PAD, and we received PMA to use the Coronary OAS as a therapy in patients with severely calcified CAD.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P58_S1	These general clearances and approvals restrict our ability to market or advertise the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS beyond these uses and could affect our growth.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	If we determine to market our orbital technology in the U.S. for other uses, we would need to conduct further clinical trials and obtain premarket approval from the FDA.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Clinical trials are complex, expensive, time consuming, uncertain and subject to substantial and unanticipated delays.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P59_S2	There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain FDA approval to use our orbital atherectomy technology for applications other than the treatment of PAD and CAD.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We are or will be subject to an extensive set of post-market controls that apply to us as we commercialize our products, including annual PMA reports, Medical Device Reports on serious adverse events, complaint handling and analysis under the FDA's QSR, export controls, advertising and promotion requirements, and potential post-market studies required by the FDA.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We and our suppliers are also subject to regulation by various state authorities, which may inspect our or our suppliers' facilities and manufacturing processes and enforce state regulations.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Failure to comply with applicable state regulations may result in seizures, injunctions or other types of enforcement actions.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our promotion of the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS is closely controlled by the FDA and enforcement activities could limit our ability to inform potential customers of the features of the products.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The Peripheral OAS or the Coronary OAS may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation and product liability claims that could exceed the limits of available insurance coverage.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material regulatory deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P64_S1	For example, since commercialization of the Peripheral OAS, we have had minor instances of recalls, including, in the year ended June 30, 2016, one recall involving thirty-eight ViperWire Advance Peripheral Guide Wire shelf cartons due to a missing use by date.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Any recalls of our products or products that we distribute would divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation with customers and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Also, if the Peripheral OAS or the Coronary OAS is defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contain defective components or are misused, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P65_S1	The use, misuse or off-label use of the Peripheral OAS or the Coronary OAS may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P65_S2	We cannot prevent a physician from using the Peripheral OAS or the Coronary OAS for off-label applications.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P65_S3	While we have product liability insurance coverage for our products and intend to maintain such insurance coverage in the future, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected from claims that are brought against us.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We are subject to many laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The Peripheral OAS or the Coronary OAS and related manufacturing processes, clinical data, adverse events, recalls or corrections and promotional activities are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory bodies.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P67_S1	In particular, we are required to comply with the QSR and other regulations, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product for which we obtain marketing clearance or approval.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P67_S2	We are also responsible for the quality of components received by our suppliers.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P67_S3	Failure to comply with the QSR requirements or other statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or failure to adequately respond to any observations, could result in, among other things:
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	If any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales to suffer.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Our operations are also subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	In addition, our relationships with physicians, hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny under various federal anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws, as further described below.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	If our operations are found to be in violation of these laws, we, as well as our employees, may be subject to penalties, including monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration health programs, workers' compensation programs and TRICARE (the healthcare system administered by or on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense for uniformed services beneficiaries, including active duty and their dependents, retirees and their dependents), and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	In addition, we have agreements with federal, state and local government agencies and third-party healthcare providers that receive government funding to sell our products.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P72_S1	We are subject to extensive regulatory compliance obligations in the award, performance and administration of our government contracts, including regulations relating to procurement integrity, pricing protection, export control, government security, employment practices, accuracy of records and the recording of costs.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P72_S2	The other parties to these agreements have the right to audit us to determine whether we are in compliance with these agreements.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, the assessment of penalties and fines, and/or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting in the future, any of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting kickbacks and false and fraudulent claims which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Additionally, any challenges to or investigations into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, and similar state laws, prohibit payments that are intended to induce health care professionals or others either to refer patients or to purchase, lease, order or arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease or order of healthcare products or services.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P74_S1	A number of states have enacted laws that require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report payments, gifts and other remuneration made to physicians and other health care professionals and health care organizations.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P74_S2	In addition, some state statutes, most notably laws in Massachusetts and Vermont, impose outright bans on certain gifts to physicians as well as requiring reporting of payments to physicians.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P74_S3	Some of these laws, referred to as aggregate spend or gift laws, carry substantial fines if they are violated.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P75_S0	The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, requires us to collect and report certain data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P76_S0	It is widely anticipated that public reporting under the Sunshine Act and implementing Open Payments regulations will result in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P77_S0	These anti-kickback, public reporting and aggregate spend laws affect our sales, marketing, promotional and clinical activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers or users of medical devices.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P77_S1	They also impose additional administrative and compliance burdens on us.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P77_S2	In particular, these laws influence, among other things, how we structure our sales offerings, including discount practices, customer support, education and training programs, physician consulting and other service arrangements, and clinical trials.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P77_S3	If we were to offer or pay inappropriate inducements to purchase our products, we could be subject to a claim under the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute or similar state laws.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P77_S4	If we fail to comply with particular reporting requirements, we could be subject to penalties under applicable federal or state laws.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P77_S5	Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payments to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or for items or services that were not provided as claimed.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P77_S6	Although we do not submit claims directly to government healthcare programs or other payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims by providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, by providing improper financial inducements, or through certain other activities.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P78_S0	In providing billing and coding information to customers, we make every effort to ensure that the billing and coding information furnished is accurate and that treating physicians understand that they are responsible for all treatment decisions.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Nevertheless, we cannot provide assurance that the government will regard any billing errors that may be made as inadvertent or that the government will not examine our role in providing information to our customers and physicians concerning the benefits of therapy with our devices.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P78_S2	Likewise, our financial relationships with customers, physicians, or others in a position to influence the purchase or use of our products may be subject to government scrutiny or be alleged or found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P79_S0	False claims laws prescribe civil, criminal and administrative penalties for noncompliance, which can be substantial.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Moreover, an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business and results of operations.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P80_S0	On May 8, 2014, we received a letter from the DOJ stating that it is investigating us to determine whether we had violated the False Claims Act, and on June 28, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the United States of America, acting through the DOJ and on behalf of the OIG, and Travis Thams, who filed the qui tam complaint underlying the DOJ s investigation (the Civil Action ), to resolve the investigation by the DOJ and the Civil Action.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P80_S1	The existence of the investigation and subsequent settlement could negatively affect our reputation and harm our business and results of operations.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P80_S2	In addition, the release we received from the government in the Settlement Agreement related to particular conduct alleged in the complaint underlying the investigation.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P81_S0	would undergo the distraction of additional investigation and potential litigation, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Compliance with the terms and conditions of our Corporate Integrity Agreement requires significant resources and management time and, if we fail to comply, we could be subject to penalties or, under certain circumstances, excluded from government healthcare programs, which would materially adversely affect our business.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P83_S0	On June 28, 2016, we entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement with the OIG.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P83_S1	The Corporate Integrity Agreement requires that we maintain our existing compliance programs and imposes certain expanded compliance-related requirements during the term of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, including establishment of specific procedures and requirements regarding consulting activities, co-marketing activities and other interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare institutions and the sale and marketing of our products; ongoing monitoring, reporting, certification and training obligations; and the engagement of an independent review organization to perform certain auditing and reviews and prepare certain reports regarding our compliance with federal health care programs.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Maintaining the broad array of processes, policies and procedures necessary to comply with the Corporate Integrity Agreement will require a significant portion of management s attention and the application of significant resources.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P83_S3	The costs associated with implementation of and compliance with the Corporate Integrity Agreement could be substantial and may be greater than we currently anticipate.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P83_S4	In addition, while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program, we cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants or our contractors are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and/or laws, all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or laws and/or all requirements of the Corporate Integrity Agreement.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P83_S5	In the event of a breach of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could become liable for payment of certain stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal health care programs.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P83_S6	The costs associated with compliance with the Corporate Integrity Agreement, or any liability or consequences associated with its breach, could have an adverse effect on our business, revenues, earnings and cash flows.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses, may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries, as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer's efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P85_S1	These disclosure requirements require ongoing due diligence efforts and disclosure obligations.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P85_S2	There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P85_S3	In addition, our ongoing implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Our anticipated international expansion will subject us to increased legal and regulatory requirements, which could have a material effect on our business.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We intend to sell internationally in the future and have commenced the process of seeking approval to do so in both Europe and Japan.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Movement into international markets will subject us and our products to different and increased laws and regulations, including foreign medical device regulations; tax laws; increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; export laws; and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P87_S2	Although we have and will continue to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, and agents, as well as those companies to which we will outsource certain aspects of our business operations, including those based in foreign countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will comply with our internal policies.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P87_S3	We will incur additional compliance costs associated with global operations, and any alleged or actual violations of these laws and regulations could subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil fines, sanctions and other liabilities, and prohibitions on business conduct, and could negatively affect our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could allow our competitors and others to produce products based on our technology, which could substantially impair our ability to compete.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Our success and ability to compete depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P89_S1	We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P89_S2	Our issued patents and related intellectual property may not be adequate to protect us or permit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P89_S3	Also, we cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P89_S4	Further, if any patents we obtain or license are deemed invalid and unenforceable, or have their scope narrowed, it could impact our ability to commercialize or license our technology and achieve competitive advantages.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P90_S1	In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, if at all.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We may, in the future, need to assert claims of infringement against third parties to protect our intellectual property.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P91_S1	The outcome of litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in patents, copyrights, trade secrets or trademarks is highly unpredictable, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, reputation and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Despite our efforts to safeguard our unpatented and unregistered intellectual property rights, we may not be successful in doing so or the steps taken by us in this regard may not be adequate to detect or deter misappropriation of our technology or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our products, technology or other information that we regard as proprietary.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P92_S1	In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to litigate, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P92_S2	Additionally, third parties may be able to design around our patents.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P93_S0	We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P93_S1	In this regard, we seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by having a policy that our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P93_S2	We cannot provide any assurance that employees and third parties will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements, or that we will be effective in securing necessary assignments from these third parties.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others could prohibit us from commercializing products, require us to obtain licenses from third parties or require us to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages and injunctive relief.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P95_S0	The medical technology industry is characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P95_S1	The likelihood that patent infringement or misappropriation claims may be brought against us increases as we achieve more visibility in the marketplace and introduce products to market.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P96_S0	We are aware of numerous patents issued to third parties that relate to the manufacture and use of medical devices for the treatment of vascular disease.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P96_S1	The owners of each of these patents could assert that the manufacture, use or sale of our products infringes one or more claims of their patents.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P96_S2	There could also be existing patents of which we are unaware that one or more aspects of our technology may inadvertently infringe.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P96_S3	In some cases, litigation may be threatened or brought by a patent-holding company or other adverse patent owner who has no relevant product revenues and against whom our patents may provide little or no deterrence.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Any infringement or misappropriation claim could cause us to incur significant costs, place significant strain on our financial resources, divert management's attention from our business and harm our reputation.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P97_S1	If the relevant patents were upheld in litigation as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe, we could be prohibited from commercializing any infringing products unless we could obtain licenses to use the technology covered by the patent or are able to design around the patent.
1180145_16_ITEM1A_P97_S2	We may be unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may not be able to redesign any infringing products to avoid infringement.
1180145_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal executive offices are located in our headquarters, a 125,000 square foot facility in St. Paul, Minnesota, which contains dedicated research and development, training and education, and manufacturing facilities, and our central administrative offices.
1180145_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	In September 2009, we entered into an agreement to lease a 46,000 square foot production facility in Pearland, Texas beginning in April 2010 through March 2020.
1180145_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	This facility primarily accommodates additional manufacturing activities.
1180145_16_ITEM2_P2_S0	We believe that our current facilities are substantially adequate for our current and anticipated future needs for the foreseeable future.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	On May 8, 2014, we received a letter from the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Western District of North Carolina (the DOJ ) stating that it is investigating us to determine whether we had violated the False Claims Act ( FCA ).
1180145_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	On July 8, 2015, the qui tam complaint underlying the Department of Justice s investigation, which was filed by Travis Thams (the Relator ) in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division (the Court ), was unsealed (the Civil Action ).
1180145_16_ITEM3_P1_S0	On June 28, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement (the Settlement Agreement ) with the United States of America, acting through the DOJ and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (the OIG ), and the Relator, to resolve the investigation by the DOJ and the Civil Action.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P1_S1	Under the Settlement Agreement, we will pay $8.0 million (the Settlement Payment ), as follows: an initial payment of $3.0 million, which we paid on July 1, 2016, with the remaining $5.0 million, which bears interest at 1.8% per annum, payable in 11 equal quarterly installments, beginning January 1, 2017.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P1_S2	We also paid Relator s reasonable expenses, costs and attorney s fees.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P1_S3	The Settlement Agreement contains no admissions of liability on our part.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P1_S4	The United States and the Relator have agreed to release us from any civil or administrative monetary liability arising from allegations that we caused the submission of false claims to federal health care programs based on alleged violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute in connection with alleged marketing arrangements and practice development activities conducted on behalf of physicians.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P1_S5	The OIG has agreed, conditioned upon our full payment of the Settlement Payment, to release its permissive exclusion rights and to refrain from instituting proceedings to exclude us or our affiliates from participating in Medicare, Medicaid or other Federal health care programs.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P2_S0	On July 1, 2016, the DOJ and the Relator filed a joint notice of dismissal of the Civil Action, with the United States dismissing with prejudice the claims asserted in the Civil Action that are covered under the Settlement Agreement and any remaining claims without prejudice, and the Relator dismissing the Civil Action in its entirety with prejudice, except for the Relator s claim for statutory attorneys fees and costs.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P2_S1	On July 11, 2016, the Court issued an order consistent with the joint notice of dismissal.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P2_S2	On August 11, 2016, the parties filed a Stipulation of Dismissal with Prejudice voluntarily dismissing the attorney's fees and costs claim with prejudice.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P2_S3	The Court will retain jurisdiction over the parties to the extent necessary to enforce the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P3_S0	In connection with the resolution of this matter, we entered into a five-year corporate integrity agreement (the Corporate Integrity Agreement ) with the OIG.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P3_S1	The Corporate Integrity Agreement requires that we maintain our existing compliance programs and imposes certain expanded compliance-related requirements during the term of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, including establishment of specific procedures and requirements regarding consulting activities, co-marketing activities and other interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare institutions and the sale and marketing of our products; ongoing monitoring, reporting, certification and training obligations; and the engagement of an independent review organization to perform certain auditing and reviews and prepare certain reports regarding our compliance with federal health care programs.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P3_S2	In the event of a breach of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could become liable for payment of certain stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal health care programs.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P4_S0	On February 12, 2016, a stockholder purporting to represent a class of persons who purchased our securities between September 12, 2011 and January 21, 2016 filed a lawsuit against us and certain of our officers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Paradis v. Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., et al., 2:16-cv-01011 (C.D. Cal.).
1180145_16_ITEM3_P4_S1	The lawsuit alleges that we made materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about our business, operational and financial performance, in violation of federal securities laws, relating to (1) alleged kickbacks to health care providers, (2) alleged off-label promotion of medical devices, and (3) alleged violations of the Food and Drug Administration s laws and regulations in connection with our medical devices.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P4_S2	On March 4, 2016, a second stockholder filed a similar lawsuit against us and certain of our officers in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, Shoemaker v. Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P4_S3	The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the alleged class, interest, and attorney s fees and costs of litigation.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P5_S0	On April 12, 2016, four motions for appointment as lead plaintiff were filed in the Paradis action and three of the four proposed plaintiffs also filed a motion for appointment as lead plaintiff in the Shoemaker action.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P6_S0	On April 26, 2016, the Paradis action was voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs in favor of the Shoemaker action.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P6_S1	That same day, the Shoemaker court entered an order appointing the City of Miami Fire Fighters Police Officers Retirement Trust and the County Retirement Systems as Co-Lead Plaintiffs for representing the putative class.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P6_S2	On June 28, 2016, the Co-Lead Plaintiffs filed a new complaint.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P6_S3	Our response to this complaint is due on August 29, 2016.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P7_S0	We believe that this lawsuit is without merit and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P8_S0	On May 10, 2016, a stockholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota naming us as nominal defendant and certain of our current and former executive officers and directors as defendants.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P8_S1	The complaint alleges that these current and former executive officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties and unjustly enriched themselves by failing to oversee our business, operations, and prospects, relating to the alleged off-label promotion of medical devices and alleged kickbacks to health care providers.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P8_S2	The complaint includes claims for breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and waste of corporate assets.
1180145_16_ITEM3_P8_S3	We believe that the lawsuit is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.
1180145_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	We trade on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol CSII.
1180145_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for our common stock (based upon intra-day trading) as reported by the Nasdaq Global Market:
1180145_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	The number of record holders of our common stock on August 19, 2016 was approximately 165.
1180145_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	No cash dividends have been previously paid on our common stock and none are anticipated during fiscal year 2017.
1180145_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	For information on our equity compensation plans, refer to Item 12, Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.
1180145_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return of our common stock ( CSII ) with the return of the Standard Poor's 500 Stock Index ( S P ) and the S P Health Care Index ( S P HC ) from June 30, 2011 through June 30, 2016.
1180145_16_ITEM5_P3_S1	The comparisons assume $100 was invested on June 30, 2011 in our common stock, the S P 500 Stock Index and the S P Health Care Index and also assumes that any dividends are reinvested.
1180145_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	The returns set forth on the following graph are based on historical results and are not intended to suggest future performance.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	You should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our business and operations, based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance, that involve risks and uncertainties.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many important factors, including the factors we describe under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are a medical device company focused on developing and commercializing innovative solutions for vascular and coronary disease.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) products, the Diamondback 360 Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy System ( OAS ) ( Diamondback 360 Peripheral ), the Diamondback 360 60cm Peripheral OAS, the Diamondback 360 4 French 1.25 Peripheral OAS, the Diamondback 360 1.50 Peripheral OAS, and the Diamondback 360 2.00 Peripheral OAS, and the Stealth 360 Peripheral OAS ( Stealth 360 ), are catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of plaque types in leg arteries both above and below the knee and address many of the limitations associated with existing surgical, catheter and pharmacological treatment alternatives.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	The micro-invasive devices use smaller access sheaths that can provide procedural benefits and allow physicians to treat PAD patients in even the small and tortuous vessels located below the knee through alternative access sites in the ankle and foot as well as in the groin.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	We refer to each of the products above in this report as the Peripheral OAS.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our coronary arterial disease ( CAD ) product, Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS ( Coronary OAS ), is marketed as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	The Coronary OAS is a catheter-based platform designed to facilitate stent delivery in patients with CAD who are acceptable candidates for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or stenting due to de novo , severely calcified coronary artery lesions.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	The Coronary OAS design is similar to technology used in our Peripheral OAS, customized specifically for the coronary application.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	From 1989 to 1997, we engaged in research and development on several different product concepts.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	Since 1997, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development of the Peripheral OAS and, since 2007, to the approval of our Coronary OAS.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	In 2006, we obtained an investigational device exemption from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to conduct our pivotal OASIS PAD clinical trial, which was completed in January 2007.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	The OASIS clinical trial was a prospective 20-center study that involved 124 patients with 201 lesions.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	In August 2007, the FDA granted us 510(k) clearance for the use of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral as a therapy in patients with PAD.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	We commenced commercial introduction of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral in the United States in September 2007.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	We were granted 510(k) clearance of the Predator 360 in March 2009 and Stealth 360 in March 2011.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P6_S3	We no longer market the Predator 360.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P6_S4	We received 510(k) clearance of the Diamondback 360 60cm Peripheral OAS in March 2014, in April 2015, we received 510(k) clearance of the Diamondback 360 4 French 1.25 Peripheral OAS, and in October 2015, we received 510(k) clearance of the Diamondback 360 1.50 and 2.00 Peripheral OAS.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	We have developed modified versions of the Peripheral OAS to treat coronary arteries.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	A coronary application required us to conduct a clinical trial and file a premarket approval ( PMA ) application, and obtain approval from the FDA.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	In March 2013, we completed submission of our PMA application to the FDA for our orbital atherectomy system to treat calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	In October 2013, we received PMA from the FDA to market the Coronary OAS as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P8_S3	We commenced a commercial launch of our Coronary OAS following receipt of PMA.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	We market the Peripheral and Coronary OAS in the United States through a direct sales force and expend significant capital on our sales and marketing efforts to expand our customer base and utilization per customer.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	We assemble at our facilities the saline infusion pump and the single-use catheter used in the Peripheral OAS with components purchased from third-party suppliers, as well as with components manufactured in-house.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	Supplemental products are purchased from third-party suppliers.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	In October 2014, we received CE Mark for our Stealth 360 device and are currently evaluating the timing and structure of our plans to commercialize our products in Europe.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	In July 2016, we submitted an application to Japan's Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency ( PMDA ) for approval of our Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown, our second generation coronary device.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	Pending approval, Japan would become the first international market for any CSI product and would represent a significant milestone for us.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	We are currently evaluating potential distribution partners in Japan.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	As of June 30, 2016 , we had an accumulated deficit of $327.4 million .
1180145_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	We expect our losses to decline as we balance revenue growth with a pathway to profitability and positive cash flow.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	To date, we have financed our operations primarily from the issuance of common and preferred stock, convertible promissory notes, and debt.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	We derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of Peripheral OAS, the Coronary OAS and other ancillary products.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	The Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS each use a disposable, single-use, low-profile catheter that travels over our proprietary ViperWire guide wire.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	The systems use a saline infusion pump as a power supply for the operation of the catheter.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	Additional ancillary products include the ViperSlide Lubricant and ViperTrack Radiopaque Tape.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	We also had an exclusive distribution agreement with Asahi to market its peripheral guide wire line in the United States, which expired in June 2015.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	We assemble the single-use catheter with components purchased from third-party suppliers, as well as with components manufactured in-house.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	The infusion pump and guide wires are purchased from third-party suppliers.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses include compensation for executive, sales, marketing, finance, information technology, human resources and administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	Other significant expenses include the medical device excise tax, bad debt expense, travel, marketing costs, professional fees and professional education.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing, enhancement and regulatory approval of our products.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	Research and development expenses include employee compensation including stock-based compensation, supplies and materials, patent expenses, consulting expenses, travel and facilities overhead.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	We also incur significant expenses to operate clinical trials, including trial design, third-party fees, clinical site reimbursement, data management and travel expenses.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P18_S3	All research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Approved patent applications are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Interest and other, net primarily includes interest expense (including premium and discount amortization), interest income, change in the fair value of the debt conversion option, debt refinancing costs, and net write-offs upon debt conversion (option and unamortized premium or discount).
1180145_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Realized gain/loss results from the distribution of investments under our deferred compensation plan.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Interest expense (including premium and discount amortization) results from outstanding debt balances and debt premiums and discounts.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Interest income is attributed to interest earned on deposits in investments that consist of money market funds.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Net write-offs upon debt conversion are the result of the conversion of convertible debt, and include the write-off of the related debt conversion option and any unamortized debt premium or discount.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	Other consists of miscellaneous non-operating expenses.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	We have established valuation allowances to fully offset our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty about our ability to generate the future taxable income necessary to realize these deferred assets, particularly in light of our historical losses.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	The future use of net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on us attaining profitable operations and will be limited in any one year under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 due to significant ownership changes (as defined in Section 382) resulting from our equity financings.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	At June 30, 2016 , we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax reporting purposes of approximately $244.2 million , which will expire at various dates through fiscal 2036.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect amounts reported in those statements.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	Our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, excess and obsolete inventory, and stock-based compensation are updated as appropriate at least quarterly.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P27_S3	We use authoritative pronouncements, our technical accounting knowledge, cumulative business experience, valuation specialists, judgment and other factors in the selection and application of our accounting policies.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P27_S4	While we believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments that we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements are appropriate, these estimates, assumptions and judgments are subject to factors and uncertainties regarding their outcome.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P27_S5	Therefore, actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Some of our significant accounting policies require us to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	We sell the majority of our products via direct shipment to hospitals or clinics.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	We record estimated sales returns, discounts and rebates as a reduction of net sales.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period the revenue is recognized.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	Cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	This allowance is an estimate and is regularly evaluated for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience, credit quality of the customer base, age of the receivable balances, both individually and in the aggregate, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	Provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts attributed to bad debt are recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	We have inventories that are principally comprised of capitalized direct labor and manufacturing overhead, raw materials and components, and finished goods.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	Due to the technological nature of our products, there is a risk of obsolescence for changes in our technology and the market, which is impacted by technological developments and events.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	Accordingly, we write down our inventories as we become aware of any situation where the carrying amount exceeds the estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future demands and market conditions.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P33_S3	The evaluation includes analysis of inventory levels, expected product lives, product at risk of expiration, sales levels by product and projections of future sales demand.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	We have stock-based compensation plans, which include stock options, nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	We determine the fair value of our option awards using option-pricing models.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	We determine the fair value of nonvested share awards with market conditions using the Monte Carlo simulation.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	Fair value of nonvested share awards that vest based upon performance or time conditions is determined by the closing market price of our stock on the date of grant.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	Stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period for the awards expected to vest.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Management's key assumptions are developed with input from independent third-party valuation advisors.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	In accordance with FASB guidance, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements related to legal proceedings when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P37_S2	If a loss is reasonably possible, but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands), and, for certain line items, the changes between the specified periods:
1180145_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Net revenues decreased by $3.4 million, or 1.9% , from $181.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 , to $178.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 .
1180145_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	This decrease was primarily attributable to expiration in June 2015 of our exclusive distribution agreement with Asahi to market its peripheral guidewire line in the United States, which contributed approximately $7.5 million in sales during the year ended June 30, 2015.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	Revenues from our Peripheral OAS decreased $6.6 million, or 4.9%, primarily reflecting a 3.4% decrease in the average selling prices, as well as a 1.5% decrease in the number of devices sold, primarily resulting from challenges associated with the expansion of our sales force and the transition to a dual-franchise (peripheral and coronary) sales organization.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P40_S3	Sales of our Coronary OAS increased approximately $9.2 million, or 34.2%, reflecting 35.2% more devices sold from the expansion of our customer base.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P40_S4	Other product revenue decreased $6.0 million, or 29.5%, during the year ended June 30, 2016 , driven by the absence of sales of the Asahi guidewires, partially offset by an increase of $1.6 million in other products that support our Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P40_S5	Currently, all of our revenues are in the United States; however, we intend to sell internationally in the future and have commenced the process of seeking approval to do so in both Europe and Japan.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P40_S6	In November 2014, we received CE Mark for the Stealth 360 and are currently evaluating the timing and structure of our plans to commercialize products in Europe.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P40_S7	In July 2016, we submitted an application to Japan's PMDA for approval of our Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P40_S8	We are currently evaluating potential distribution partners in Japan.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P40_S9	We expect our revenue to increase as we continue to increase the number of physicians using the devices, increase the usage per physician, introduce new and improved products, generate additional clinical data, and expand into new geographies.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Cost of goods sold decreased by $4.1 million, or 10.4% , from $39.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 to $35.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 .
1180145_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	These amounts represent the cost of materials, labor and overhead for single-use catheters, guide wires, pumps, and other ancillary products.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	The decrease was primarily due to lower indirect costs per unit sold from higher production volumes and manufacturing efficiencies.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P41_S3	Gross margin increased to 80.1% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 78.2% for the year ended June 30, 2015 due to lower costs per unit, as discussed above.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P41_S4	Cost of goods sold for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 includes $0.8 million and $1.0 million , respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P41_S5	We expect that gross margin in fiscal 2017 will be comparable to the year ended June 30, 2016.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	Quarterly margin fluctuations could occur based on production volumes, timing of new product introductions, sales mix, pricing changes, or other unanticipated circumstances.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses .
1180145_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $18.9 million, or 13.1% , from $143.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 to $162.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to the expansion of our sales and administrative organizations.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	In addition, we incurred a $1.5 million expense associated with the departure of our former CEO and increased legal fees primarily associated with the Department of Justice matter discussed below.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P43_S3	Partially offsetting the increase was a reduction in medical device excise tax expense of $1.5 million due to the suspension of the tax, effective January 1, 2016.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P43_S4	Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 include $10.4 million and $12.2 million , respectively, for stock-based compensation, which decreased due to lower than expected attainment of performance based restricted stock award goals.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P43_S5	We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease in fiscal 2017 due to cost management initiatives.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	Research and development expenses decreased by $5.0 million, or 16.3% , from $31.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 to $25.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 .
1180145_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	Research and development expenses relate to the specific projects to develop new products or expand into new markets, such as the development of new versions of our Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS, and ancillary products, and PAD and CAD clinical studies.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	The decrease primarily related to the completion of enrollment in several of our clinical studies.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P44_S3	Research and development expenses for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 include $1.8 million and $1.5 million , respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P44_S4	We generally expect to incur research and development expenses slightly higher in fiscal 2017 than amounts incurred for the year ended June 30, 2016 due to timing of projects and studies.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P44_S5	Fluctuations could occur based on the number of projects and studies and the timing of expenditures.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	In March 2016, we announced a broad-based restructuring to reduce costs as a key part of our plan to balance revenue growth with a pathway to profitability and positive cash flow.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	As a result, we recorded a restructuring expense of $2.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2016, which was comprised of severance and other employee related costs.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	We do not anticipate additional charges related to restructuring activities.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	On June 28, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the United States of America, acting through the United States Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina (the DOJ ) and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and Travis Thams (the Relator ), to resolve the previously disclosed investigation by the DOJ and the qui tam complaint filed by the Relator pursuant to the False Claims Act in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	We recorded an $8.0 million legal settlement expense during the year ended June 30, 2016.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	Payments will be made as follows: an initial payment of $3.0 million, made in July 2016, with the remaining $5.0 million, which bears interest at 1.8% per annum, payable in 11 equal quarterly installments, beginning January 1, 2017.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	Revenues increased by $44.9 million, or 32.9%, from $136.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2014, to $181.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	This increase was primarily attributable to sales of our Coronary OAS which contributed approximately $26.9 million in revenues for the year ended June 30, 2015, compared to approximately $5.0 million in the year ended June 30, 2014 following our PMA in October 2013.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	Revenues from our Peripheral OAS also increased $19.0 million, or 16.5%, which reflects 16.7% more device units sold.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	during the year ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2014, primarily driven by increased sales of Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS, which the other products support.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Cost of goods sold increased by $8.5 million, or 27.3%, from $31.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2014 to $39.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	These amounts represent the cost of materials, labor and overhead for single-use catheters, guide wires, pumps, and other ancillary products.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	The increase was due to an increase in the quantities of products sold, partially offset by lower indirect costs per unit from higher production volumes and manufacturing efficiencies.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P49_S3	The increase in gross margin from 77.3% for the year ended June 30, 2014, to 78.2% for the year ended June 30, 2015, was primarily due to the increase in sales of our Coronary OAS, which had a higher average selling price than the Peripheral OAS, and to lower indirect costs per unit.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P49_S4	Cost of goods sold for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 includes $1.0 million and $0.7 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $25.7 million, or 21.8%, from $118.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2014 to $143.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2015.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	The increase was due to higher expenses from the coronary commercial launch, the expansion of our sales and marketing organization, increased medical education, and higher incentive and stock-based compensation.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 include $12.2 million and $9.2 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Research and development expenses increased by $9.9 million, or 47.0%, from $21.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2014 to $31.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2015.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	Research and development expenses relate to the specific projects to develop new products or expand into new markets, such as the development of new versions of our Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS, and ancillary products, and PAD and CAD clinical studies.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	The increase primarily related to additional product development projects and clinical studies, and the related increase in headcount.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P51_S3	Research and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 include $1.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Interest and other, net was $(0.2) million and $(1.8) million for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	The decrease was primarily driven by lower interest expense related to lower outstanding debt balances, as well as charges in the year ended June 30, 2014 from debt conversions and changes in fair value of the debt conversion option that were associated with previously outstanding convertible debt.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	To supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, our management uses a non-GAAP financial measure referred to as Adjusted EBITDA.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands):
1180145_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	Adjusted EBITDA declined as compared to the prior year due to the higher loss from operations, as well as lower stock based compensation related to lower than expected attainment of performance based restricted stock awards.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	These were partially offset by increased depreciation due to the completion of our new headquarters in March 2015.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of performance and believe this measure facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by factoring out potential differences caused by non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expense.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA to analyze the underlying trends in our business, assess the performance of our core operations, establish operational goals and forecasts that are used to allocate resources and evaluate our performance period over period and in relation to our competitors operating results.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	We believe that presenting Adjusted EBITDA provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	We also believe that providing this information better enables our investors to understand our operating performance and evaluate the methodology used by our management to evaluate and measure such performance.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	The following is an explanation of each of the items that management excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and the reasons for excluding each of these individual items:
1180145_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP financial measures primarily because such expense, while constituting an ongoing and recurring expense, is not an expense that requires cash settlement.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	Our management also believes that excluding this item from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand its impact on our operational performance and ability to make additional investments in the Company, and it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	We exclude depreciation and amortization expense from our non-GAAP financial measures primarily because such expenses, while constituting ongoing and recurring expenses, are not expenses that require cash settlement and are not used by our management to assess the core profitability of our business operations.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	Our management also believes that excluding these items from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand our operational performance and ability to make additional investments in the Company.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	Some of the limitations associated with our use of these non-GAAP financial measures are:
1180145_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	Items such as stock-based compensation do not directly affect our cash flow position; however, such items reflect economic costs to us and are not reflected in our Adjusted EBITDA and therefore these non-GAAP measures do not reflect the full economic effect of these items.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore other companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	Our management exercises judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures we use.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily upon our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	We had cash and cash equivalents of $60.6 million and $83.8 million at June 30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	During the year ended June 30, 2016 , net cash used in operations amounted to $23.6 million .
1180145_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	As of June 30, 2016 , we had an accumulated deficit of $327.4 million .
1180145_16_ITEM7_P65_S3	We have historically funded our operating losses primarily from the issuance of stock, convertible promissory notes, and debt.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	We had the following registered underwritten public offering during the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014:
1180145_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	(1) Proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses (in thousands).
1180145_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	We have used, and intend to use, the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not limited to:
1180145_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering for the potential acquisition of businesses, technologies and products.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to us from the offering.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion over the use of these proceeds.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P70_S2	Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in investment-grade, interest-bearing securities.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	Cash and cash equivalents was $60.6 million and $83.8 million at June 30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	The decrease was primarily attributable to net cash used in operating activities during the year ended June 30, 2016.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	Net cash used in operating activities was $23.6 million , $22.4 million , and $26.8 million for the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	For the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , we had a net loss of $56.0 million , $32.8 million , and $35.3 million , respectively, and stock based compensation expense of $13.0 million , $14.7 million , and $10.9 million , respectively.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P72_S2	Changes in working capital accounts also contributed to the net cash used in the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 .
1180145_16_ITEM7_P72_S3	Significant changes in working capital during these periods included:
1180145_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	Cash used in inventories was $(3.5) million , $(1.1) million , and $(6.6) million during the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	The increase in cash used by inventory was due to higher levels of inventory for future sales growth and new product launches, such as the Diamondback 360 Low Profile Peripheral OAS commercial launch in fiscal 2016 and Coronary OAS commercial launch throughout fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, as well as timing of inventory purchases and sales.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	Cash provided by (used in) prepaid expenses and other current assets was $0.7 million , $(1.2) million , and $(0.6) million during the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively, primarily due to payment timing of vendor deposits and other expenditures.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	Cash provided by accrued expenses and other liabilities was $10.9 million , $4.4 million , and $6.7 million during the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P75_S1	Cash provided in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the restructuring accrual, benefits related to our former CEO's departure, and the Department of Justice legal settlement expense.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P75_S2	Cash provided in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to higher accruals for the executive deferred compensation plan, higher payroll and vacation liabilities related to increased headcount, clinical study accruals for increased activity, and the general timing and payment of accruals.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P75_S3	Cash provided by accrued expenses and other liabilities in fiscal 2014 was primarily related to increased incentive compensation related to performance above goals, higher accrued commissions due to increased sales, and higher payroll related expenses related to headcount and timing of payments.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	Net cash used in investing activities was $3.8 million , $23.0 million , and $13.4 million for the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	During fiscal 2016, cash was used primarily for the purchase of property and equipment and patents, and for the issuance of a convertible note receivable, partially offset by the sale of available-for-sale marketable securities under the deferred compensation plan.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P76_S2	During fiscal 2015, cash was used primarily for the construction of our new headquarters and the related equipment purchases.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P76_S3	In addition, we purchased available-for-sale marketable securities for the deferred compensation plans.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P76_S4	Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2014 primarily related to the payments towards the construction of our new headquarters as well as investments in equipment and patents.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	Net cash provided by financing activities was $4.1 million , $2.6 million , and $99.0 million during the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	Cash provided by financing activities during these periods included:
1180145_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	Cash used in financing activities in these periods included payments on long-term debt of $2.4 million and $9.9 million during the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	Our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including the extent and duration of future operating losses, the level and timing of future sales and expenditures, the results and scope of ongoing research and product development programs, working capital required to support our sales growth, the receipt of and time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals, our sales and marketing programs, the continuing acceptance of our products in the marketplace, competing technologies, market and regulatory developments, ongoing facility requirements, potential strategic transactions (including the potential acquisition of businesses, technologies and products), and the existence, defense and resolution of legal proceedings.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	As of June 30, 2016, we believe our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, operations for the foreseeable future, including at least the next twelve months, as well as to fund payments related to the Department of Justice settlement, expenses relating to implementation and compliance with our Corporate Integrity Agreement, and payments related to our restructuring and departure of our former CEO.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P79_S2	We also believe we have the potential ability to finance our new Minnesota facility and obtain debt financing, which could further supplement funds if warranted.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P79_S3	We intend to retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of our business and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	As previously discussed in Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on June 28, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the DOJ, pursuant to which we will pay $8.0 million as follows: an initial payment of $3.0 million, which we paid on July 1, 2016, with the remaining $5.0 million, which bears interest at 1.8% per annum, payable in 11 equal quarterly installments, beginning January 1, 2017.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	In connection with the resolution of this matter, we entered into a five-year corporate integrity agreement (the Corporate Integrity Agreement ) with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services ( OIG ).
1180145_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	The Corporate Integrity Agreement requires that we maintain our existing compliance programs and imposes certain expanded compliance-related requirements during the term of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, including establishment of specific procedures and requirements regarding consulting activities, co-marketing activities and other interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare institutions and the sale and marketing of our products; ongoing monitoring, reporting, certification and training obligations; and the engagement of an independent review organization to perform certain auditing and reviews and prepare certain reports regarding our compliance with federal health care programs.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P81_S2	In the event of a breach of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could become liable for payment of certain stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal health care programs.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P81_S3	The Corporate Integrity Agreement will require us to invest additional amounts in our compliance program and pay fees and expenses of the independent review organization.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	On March 31, 2016, we announced a broad-based restructuring to reduce costs as a part of our plan to balance revenue growth with a pathway to profitability and positive cash flow.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	As a result, we recorded a restructuring expense of $2.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016, which was comprised of severance and other employee related costs.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P82_S2	Approximately $1.3 million is payable over the next twelve months and $184,000 payable in subsequent periods.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P82_S3	See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	Effective February 26, 2016, David L. Martin resigned from his positions as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and as a director of the Company.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	We and Mr. Martin entered into a Separation Agreement which results in payments of approximately $708,000 that will be paid within the next twelve months and estimated payments of $427,000 primarily payable in the subsequent twelve months.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P83_S2	See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	Our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of June 30, 2016 are summarized below:
1180145_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	(1) The amounts represent future minimum payments under a non-cancellable operating leases for our offices and production facility along with equipment.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	(3) Consists of payments and related interest associated with the DOJ Settlement discussed above.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P85_S2	(4) Includes severance related to our former CEO, restructuring activities, and other severance agreements.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P85_S3	(5) Other includes service agreements and other employee-related restructuring payments.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at June 30, 2016, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	Therefore, $545,000 of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business and operating results during the periods presented.
1180145_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	Since inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.

1180145_16_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P1_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P1_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1180145_16_ITEM8_P9_S0	Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (the Company ) was incorporated as Replidyne, Inc. ( Replidyne ) in Delaware in 2000 .
1180145_16_ITEM8_P9_S1	On February 25, 2009, Replidyne completed its business combination with Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., a Minnesota corporation, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of November 3, 2008.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P9_S2	At the effective time of the merger, Replidyne changed its name to Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	The Company develops, manufactures and markets devices for the treatment of vascular diseases.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P10_S1	The Company s peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) products, the Diamondback 360 Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy System ( OAS ) and the Stealth 360 Peripheral OAS, are catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of plaque types, including calcified plaque, in leg arteries both above and below the knee, and address many of the limitations associated with other surgical, catheter and pharmacological treatment alternatives.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P10_S2	These devices use smaller access sheaths that can provide procedural benefits and allow physicians to treat PAD patients in a variety of vessel sizes, including the small and tortuous vessels located below the knee through alternative access sites in the ankle and foot as well as in the groin.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	In October 2013, the Company received premarket approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration to market the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company is currently selling only in the United States and evaluating options for international expansion to maximize the coronary and peripheral market opportunities.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P12_S1	In June 2016, the Company submitted an application to Japan's Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency for approval of our Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P12_S2	Pending approval, Japan would become the first international market for any of the Company's products and would represent a significant milestone.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P12_S3	The Company is currently evaluating potential distribution partners in Japan.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	The consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, after elimination of all intercompany transactions and accounts.

1180145_16_ITEM8_P15_S1	Customer credit terms are established prior to shipment with the general standard being net 30 days.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P15_S2	Collateral or any other security to support payment of these receivables generally is not required.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P15_S3	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P15_S4	This allowance is an estimate and is regularly evaluated by the Company for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience, credit quality of the customer base, age of the receivable balances, both individually and in the aggregate, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P15_S5	Provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts attributed to bad debt are recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	The following table shows the allowance for doubtful accounts activity:
1180145_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first-in, first-out method of valuation.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	The establishment of inventory allowances for excess and obsolete inventories is based on estimated exposure on specific inventory items.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P18_S1	We write down our inventories as we become aware of any situation where the carrying amount exceeds the estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future demands and market conditions.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company relies on single source suppliers for certain components of the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P19_S1	Any supply interruption would limit the Company's ability to manufacture its products and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	Property and equipment is carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P20_S1	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 40 years for the building; five to seven years for production equipment and furniture and fixtures; three years for computer equipment and software; and the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term for leasehold improvements.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P20_S2	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs and minor renewals and betterments which do not extend or improve the life of the respective assets are expensed as incurred.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P20_S3	All other expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P20_S4	The assets and related depreciation accounts are adjusted for property retirements and disposals with the resulting gains or losses included in the consolidated statement of operations.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	The capitalized costs incurred to obtain patents are amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P21_S1	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	The recoverability of capitalized patent costs is dependent upon the Company s ability to derive revenue-producing products from such patents or the ultimate sale or licensing of such patent rights.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	Patent recoverability is regularly reviewed and any patents that are abandoned are written off at the time of abandonment.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company regularly evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or that the remaining estimated useful life should be changed.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated by the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company leases its Texas manufacturing facilities under an operating lease agreement.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	The lease contains rent escalation clauses for which the lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P25_S2	Rent expense that is recognized but not yet paid is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

1180145_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P26_S2	The Company records estimated sales returns, discounts and rebates as a reduction of net sales.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	Costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period the revenue is recognized.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	Cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Company provides its customers with the right to receive a replacement if a product is determined to be defective at the time of shipment.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	Warranty reserve provisions are estimated based on Company experience, volume, and expected warranty claims.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P28_S2	Warranty reserve, provisions and claims were as follows:
1180145_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	The Company and its operations from time to time are, and in the future may be, parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues an amount based on management's best estimate considering all facts and circumstances.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P30_S1	The Company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 imposed a medical device excise tax on medical device manufacturers on their sales in the U.S. of certain devices, which was effective January 1, 2013.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	The excise tax is 2.3% of the taxable base and applies to a substantial majority of the Company's sales.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P31_S2	Effective January 1, 2016, the excise tax was suspended until the end of 2017.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P31_S3	For the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the Company incurred $1,273 , $2,731 , and $2,273 of expense, respectively.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	Developing a provision for income taxes, including the effective tax rate and the analysis of potential tax exposure items, if any, requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws, regulations and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P33_S1	The Company s judgment and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	Accounting guidance requires that accounting for uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in the financial statements.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P34_S1	The guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P34_S2	Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P34_S3	The guidance also provides rules on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing, enhancement and regulatory approval of the Company s products.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P35_S1	Research and development expenses include employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), supplies and materials, consulting expenses, patent amortization, travel and facilities overhead.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P35_S2	The Company also incurs significant expenses to operate clinical trials, including trial design, third-party fees, clinical site reimbursement, data management and travel expenses.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P35_S3	Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P35_S4	Expenses associated with patent applications are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P35_S5	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years .
1180145_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company maintains its cash balances primarily with one financial institution.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P37_S1	These balances exceed federally insured limits.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P37_S2	The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in cash and cash equivalents.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company believes that the credit risk related to marketable securities is limited due to the adherence to an investment policy and that credit risk related to accounts receivable is limited due to a large customer base.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company's marketable securities consist solely of available-for-sale securities and were valued in accordance with the fair value measurement guidance discussed below.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P39_S1	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of stockholders' equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P39_S2	Realized gains and losses, if any, are calculated on the specific identification method and are included in interest and other, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	Available-for-sale securities are reviewed for possible impairment at least quarterly, or more frequently if circumstances arise which may indicate impairment.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P40_S1	When the fair value of the securities declines below the amortized cost basis, impairment is indicated and it must be determined whether it is other than temporary.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P40_S2	Impairment is considered to be other than temporary if the Company: (i) intends to sell the security, (ii) will more likely than not be forced to sell the security before recovering its cost, or (iii) does not expect to recover the security's amortized cost basis.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P40_S3	If the decline in fair value is considered other than temporary, the cost basis of the security is adjusted to its fair market value and the realized loss is reported in earnings.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P40_S4	Subsequent increases or decreases in fair value are reported in equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
1180145_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	Under the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P41_S1	The authoritative guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	The categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	The hierarchy is broken down into three levels defined as follows:
1180145_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	As of June 30, 2016 , the Company believes that the carrying amounts of its other financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	See Note 3 for additional information.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	The preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P46_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates and these differences could be material.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company has stock-based compensation plans, which include stock options, nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	Fair value of option awards is determined using option-pricing models, fair value of nonvested share awards with market conditions is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation, and fair value of nonvested share awards that vest based upon performance or service conditions is determined by the closing market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P47_S2	Stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period for the awards expected to vest.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue From Customers With Contracts.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P48_S1	The guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P48_S2	The guidance also requires expanded disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P48_S3	Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	ASU 2014-09 was initially to be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, using one of two prescribed retrospective methods.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P49_S1	Early adoption was not to be permitted.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P49_S2	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year and allow early adoption for all entities but not before the original public entity effective date.

1180145_16_ITEM8_P57_S1	The guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016 and can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P58_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the deferred tax guidance on its financial statements upon adoption.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases.

1180145_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P61_S1	Early adoption is permitted and transition requirements vary based on the amendments adopted.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P61_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the stock compensation guidance on its financial statements.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which amends ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , to address implementation issues relative to transition (adding a practical expedient for contract modifications and clarifying what constitutes a completed contract when employing ASU 2014-09 s full or modified retrospective transition methods), collectability, noncash consideration, and the presentation of sales and other similar-type taxes (allowing entities to exclude sales-type taxes collected from transaction price).
1180145_16_ITEM8_P62_S1	This ASU has the same effective date and transition requirements as ASU 2014-09, as amended by ASU 2015-14.

1180145_16_ITEM8_P118_S3	Accordingly, our deferred tax assets are reported net of the excess tax deductions for stock compensation.

1180145_16_ITEM8_P120_S2	The Company recorded a liability relating to unrecognized tax benefits of $545 and $494 at June 30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P120_S3	Due to the Company having a full valuation allowance, this liability has been netted against the deferred tax asset.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P120_S4	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax provisions as part of the provision for income taxes.
1180145_16_ITEM8_P120_S5	The Company has not currently reserved for any interest or penalties for such reserves due to the Company being in an NOL position.

1180145_16_ITEM15_P119_S0	Federal law requires the Company to provide to employees a Statement of ERISA Rights set forth in federal regulations.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P119_S1	That statement, which follows, describes some of the Executive Officers rights under federal law with respect to the Plan.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P120_S0	As a participant in the Plan, Executive Officers are entitled to certain rights and protections under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ).
1180145_16_ITEM15_P120_S1	ERISA provides that all Plan participants shall be entitled to:
1180145_16_ITEM15_P121_S0	(a) Examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrator s office and at other specified locations, such as worksites, all documents governing this Plan, including insurance contracts and collective bargaining agreements, if any, filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P122_S0	(b) Obtain, upon written request to the Plan Administrator, copies of documents governing the operation of this Plan, including insurance contracts and collective bargaining agreements, if any, and updated summary plan description.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P122_S1	The Administrator may make a reasonable charge for the copies.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P123_S0	(c) Receive a summary of the Plan s annual financial report.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P123_S1	The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each participant with a copy of this summary annual report.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P124_S0	In addition to creating rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the Plan.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P124_S1	The people who operate the Plan, called fiduciaries of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other plan participants and beneficiaries.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P124_S2	No one, including the Company or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P125_S0	If your claim for a benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P126_S0	Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P126_S1	For instance, if you request a copy of documents and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a federal court.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P126_S2	In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P127_S0	If you have a claim for benefits that is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P127_S1	If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries do not administer the Plan in accordance with its terms, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P127_S2	The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P127_S3	If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P127_S4	If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees; for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P128_S0	If you have any questions about this Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator.
1180145_16_ITEM15_P128_S1	If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.

1180145_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	We are a medical technology company leading the way in the effort to successfully treat patients suffering from peripheral and coronary artery diseases, including those with arterial calcium, the most difficult arterial disease to treat.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	We are committed to clinical rigor, constant innovation and a defining drive to set the industry standard to deliver safe and effective medical devices that improve lives of patients facing this difficult disease state.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	We have developed a patented orbital atherectomy technology for both peripheral and coronary commercial applications.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our systems are catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of vessel sizes and plaque types, including calcified plaque, and address many of the limitations associated with other treatment alternatives.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P5_S2	We refer to the Diamondback 360 Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy Systems ( OAS ) ( Diamondback 360 Peripheral ), the Stealth 360 OAS ( Stealth 360 ), and the products included in the chart below collectively in this annual report on Form 10-K as the Peripheral OAS.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	The United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) granted us 510(k) clearance for the following Peripheral OAS as a therapy in patients with peripheral artery disease ( PAD ):
1180145_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	As of June 30, 2017 , over 292,000 of our Peripheral OAS have been sold to leading institutions across the United States.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	Sales of Peripheral OAS during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 represented 69% of revenue.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	Our coronary product, the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS ( Coronary OAS ), is a catheter-based platform designed to facilitate stent delivery in patients with coronary artery disease ( CAD ) who are acceptable candidates for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or stenting due to de novo , severely calcified coronary artery lesions.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	The Coronary OAS design is similar to technology used in our Peripheral OAS, customized specifically for the coronary application.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P8_S2	In October 2013, we received premarket approval ( PMA ) from the FDA to market the Coronary OAS as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P8_S3	We commenced a commercial launch that same month and, as of June 30, 2017 , over 31,000 Coronary OAS have been sold to leading institutions across the United States.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P8_S4	Sales of Coronary OAS during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 represented approximately 23% of revenue.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P8_S5	In March 2017, the Company received approval from the FDA to market its Diamondback360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown, which is the only atherectomy device designed to both pilot tight, calcific lesions and treat 2.5 to 4mm vessels with a single device.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P8_S6	We are planning a limited release of the Coronary OAS Micro Crown in the U.S. in fiscal 2018.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	In addition to the Peripheral and Coronary OAS, we offer multiple accessory products required for use with the Peripheral and Coronary OAS.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	Sales of accessory products, primarily guide wires, represented 8% of revenue during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 .
1180145_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	In November 2016, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Medikit Co., Ltd. to sell the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown in Japan.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	In March 2017, we received approval from Japan s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare ( MHLW ) of our Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	Pending reimbursement approval, Japan will become the first international market for any CSI product and represents a significant milestone for us.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	We will continue to evaluate options for additional international markets to expand the coronary and peripheral opportunities.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	Peripheral artery disease is widespread and can be life threatening.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	The disease is characterized by narrowed, hardened arteries in the legs, limiting blood flow to the legs and feet.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	If left untreated, PAD may continue to progress to Critical Limb Ischemia ( CLI ), a condition in which the amount of oxygenated blood being delivered to the limb is insufficient to keep the tissue alive.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	CLI may lead to non-healing ulcers, infections, gangrene, limb amputation or death.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	According to estimates by the American Heart Association ( AHA ), as many as 8 to 12 million Americans have PAD.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	An aging population, coupled with increasing incidence of diabetes and obesity, is likely to continue to increase the prevalence of PAD.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	In many older PAD patients, particularly those with diabetes, PAD is characterized by fibrotic (moderately hard) or calcified (extremely hard) plaque deposits that can be very challenging to treat.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	Although we believe the rate of PAD diagnoses is increasing, we also believe that under-diagnosis continues, due to patients failing to display symptoms or physicians misinterpreting symptoms as normal aging.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	with publications in medical journals and public news channels, is increasing physician and patient awareness of PAD risk factors, symptoms, and treatment options.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Physicians manage a significant portion of the PAD diagnosed population by recommending lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, and by prescribing prescription drugs, such as statins.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	While medications, diet and exercise may improve blood flow, they do not treat the underlying obstructions, and many patients have difficulty maintaining lifestyle changes.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	As a result of these challenges, many medically managed patients develop more severe symptoms that require procedural intervention.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Heart disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease in the U.S. and is a life-threatening condition.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	CAD occurs when a fatty material called plaque builds up on the walls of arteries that supply blood to the heart.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	The plaque buildup causes the arteries to harden and narrow (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	The risk of CAD increases if a person has one or more of the following: high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, or family history of early heart disease.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	According to the AHA, 15.5 million people in the U.S. (or 6.2% of the adult population) suffer from CAD, the most common form of heart disease.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 370,000 lives are claimed in the U.S. each year from CAD.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	According to estimates, significant arterial calcium is present in nearly 40% of patients (Genereux et al., 2014; Bourantas et al., 2014), and severe calcium affects up to 20% of patients (Bourantas et al., 2014), undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ).
1180145_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	Significant calcium contributes to poor outcomes and higher treatment costs in coronary interventions when traditional therapies are used, including a significantly higher occurrence of death and major adverse cardiac events ( MACE ).
1180145_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our orbital atherectomy systems represent an innovative approach to the treatment of PAD and CAD that provide physicians and patients with a procedure that addresses many of the limitations of other treatment alternatives.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	The Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS devices are single-use catheters that incorporate a control handle and flexible drive shaft with an eccentrically mounted diamond-coated crown.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	The peripheral device is often used for vessel preparation to enable low pressure percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, including the use of drug-coated balloons ( DCB ), and results in lower use of bailout stents.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P27_S2	The coronary device is used to treat severe calcium prior to stent delivery to help facilitate optimal stent expansion and prevent malapposition of stent struts.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	The OAS treats atherosclerotic plaque, which is harder than a normal vessel wall.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	The OAS is designed to differentiate between hard, diseased plaque and healthy, compliant arterial tissue, a concept that we refer to as differential sanding.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P28_S2	The diamond-coated crown preferentially engages and sands away harder material, but is designed not to damage more compliant parts of the artery, which flex away from the crown.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	Physicians position the crown at the site of a lesion containing arterial plaque and orbit the crown against it to sand away the superficial, or surface, plaque and create a smooth lumen, or channel, in the vessel.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	In addition, the crown s rotating eccentric mass and orbital motion deliver pulsatile mechanical energy into the vessel wall.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P29_S2	These pulsatile forces may break up deeper plaque and contribute to compliance change of the diseased segment of the artery.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our OAS uses a single-use, low-profile catheter that travels over our proprietary ViperWire guide wires and is electrically powered by a saline infusion pump that also helps cool the system and remove debris.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Peripheral OAS reduces plaque on peripheral vessel walls by using an orbiting, diamond-coated crown within peripheral arteries.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	Similarly, the Coronary OAS uses the same method to reduce severely calcified plaque on coronary vessel walls within coronary arteries in order to facilitate stent delivery.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	The catheter for our OAS consists of:
1180145_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	a sheath, which covers the drive shaft and permits delivery of saline or medications to the treatment area.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	ViperWire Advance Peripheral Guide Wire, ViperWire Advance Peripheral Guide Wire with Flex Tip and ViperWire Advance Coronary Guide Wire.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	The ViperWire guide wires are required for using the OAS and were designed to offer the ability to maneuver through tortuous, twisting blood vessels and cross challenging lesions.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P34_S2	The OAS travels over this wire to the lesion and operates on this wire.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	ViperSlide is an exclusive lubricant designed to optimize the smooth operation of the OAS.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	The saline infusion pump bathes the OAS shaft and crown and provides an electric power supply for the operation of the catheter.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	The constant flow of saline during orbit reduces the risk of heat generation and improves the flush of particulates.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	The mechanism of action is a function of the centrifugal force generated by the eccentrically mounted crown as it rotates and orbits inside the vessel.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	As the speed of the crown s rotation increases, centrifugal force increases the crown s radius of orbit and presses the diamond-coated crown against the lesion or plaque, removing a small amount of plaque with each orbit.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P37_S2	The centrifugal force exerted onto the vessel wall decreases as the orbital radius increases, reducing the likelihood of adverse events during treatment.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	The characteristics of the orbit and the resulting lumen size can be adjusted by modifying the following two variables:
1180145_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	An increase in speed creates a larger orbital radius, thus accommodating larger diameter vessels.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	Our Peripheral OAS allows the user to choose between three rotational speeds and our Coronary OAS Classic Crown allows the user to choose between two rotational speeds.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	The crowns for the OAS are designed with various weights (as determined by crown geometry and material density) and are coated with diamond particles.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	The Peripheral OAS crowns are available in three configurations: classic, micro and solid.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P40_S2	Physicians select crown sizes and configurations based on several case criteria, including reference vessel size, lesion length and degree of stenosis, stenosis morphology, and anatomy tortuosity.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P40_S3	The crown for the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS is available in two configurations: 1.25 millimeter classic crown and the recently-approved 1.25 millimeter micro crown which is designed to both pilot through tight, severely calcified coronary lesions and treat 2.5 to 4mm vessels with a single device.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	Centrifugal force propels the crown outward against the arterial wall as the crown rotates.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	This force is offset by the counterforce exerted by the arterial wall and the guidewire.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	Normal arteries are compliant and have the ability to expand and contract as needed to supply blood flow.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	If the tissue is compliant, it flexes away, minimizing the engagement of the diamond-grit and protecting the integrity of the healthy tissue.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P42_S2	Diseased tissue is less flexible or non-compliant and provides resistance to the centrifugal force, which generates an opposing force that enables the diamond-coated crown to engage and sand the plaque.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P42_S3	The sanded plaque and calcium is broken down into particles generally smaller than circulating red blood cells that are washed away downstream with the patient s natural blood flow.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	The small particle size and short treatment time minimizes the risk of vascular bed overload, or a saturation of the peripheral or coronary vessels with large particles, which may cause slow or reduced blood flow.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P43_S1	The small size of the particles allows them to be naturally cleared from the blood via various types of white blood cells and macrophages.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	We believe the OAS offers the following key benefits:
1180145_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	Differential Sanding Reduces Risk of Adverse Events .
1180145_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	The OAS is designed to differentiate between hard, non-compliant plaque and soft, compliant arterial tissue.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	Arteries are composed of three tissue layers (from inside to out): the intima, media, and adventitia.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	The eccentrically mounted diamond-coated crown at the working end of the device engages and removes plaque from the artery wall with minimal likelihood of penetrating or damaging the fragile intima, or inner layer of the arterial wall because soft, compliant tissue flexes away from the crown.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	The small size of the particles produced during sanding avoids the need for ancillary distal protection devices, commonly used with directional cutting atherectomy devices.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	The small particulate size also significantly reduces the risk of macroembolization, or larger pieces of removed plaque capable of blocking blood flow downstream.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	Allows Continuous Blood Flow During Procedure.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	The OAS allows for continuous blood flow while orbiting, as well as constant flushing of particulates during treatment.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	Other devices may restrict blood flow due to the size of the catheter required or the use of distal protection devices, which could result in complications such as excessive heat and tissue damage.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	The Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS portfolio is uniquely compatible with 4 French ( Fr ) to 6Fr sheaths.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	Centrifugal force enables the OAS to treat large vessels through small sheaths; for example, it can treat up to 5mm vessel through a 4Fr sheath.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	Smaller sheaths may be associated with less femoral bleeding, shortened post-procedure ambulation time and reduced radiation exposure.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P50_S3	In addition, the primary complication in peripheral interventions is a vascular access site complication.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P50_S4	Exchanging to a larger sheath has been shown to be the strongest predictor of bleeding complication during peripheral interventions.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	Efficacy Demonstrated for Both Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	Peripheral OAS - Our pivotal OASIS clinical trial was a prospective 20-center study that involved 124 patients with 201 lesions treated by the Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P52_S1	Performance targets were established cooperatively with the FDA before the trial began.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P52_S2	Despite 55% of the lesions consisting of calcified plaque, the Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS successfully met the study endpoints.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	Coronary OAS - Our pivotal ORBIT II coronary OAS trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OAS in treating de novo severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	The trial met both the primary safety and efficacy endpoints by significant margins.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P53_S2	Preparation of severely calcified plaque with the Coronary OAS not only helped facilitate stent delivery, but also improved both peri-procedural and 30-day clinical outcomes compared with the outcomes of historic control subjects in this difficult-to-treat patient population.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	Treats Difficult, Fibrotic and Calcified Lesions.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	The OAS enables physicians to remove plaque from long, fibrotic, calcified or bifurcated lesions, as well as lesions with softer plaque, in peripheral arteries both above and below the knee.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	In the coronary arteries, the OAS enables physicians to treat complex, severely calcified lesions, enabling stent placement in these difficult to treat lesions.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P55_S2	To date, the Coronary OAS is the only FDA-approved device approved specifically for treatment of severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	The orbiting action of the OAS removes the hard plaque in the artery by sanding, while the centrifugal motion of the eccentrically mounted crown creates pulsatile forces.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	Compliance change is achieved as the OAS differentiates between hard, diseased plaque and healthy, compliant arterial tissue, a concept that we refer to as differential sanding.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P56_S2	The diamond-coated crown preferentially engages and sands away harder material, but is designed not to damage more compliant parts of the artery, which flex away from the crown.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	Physicians position the crown at the site of a lesion containing arterial plaque and orbit the crown against it to sand away the superficial, or surface, plaque and create a smooth lumen, or channel, in the vessel.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	In addition, the crown s rotating eccentric mass and orbital motion deliver pulsatile mechanical energy into the vessel wall.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P57_S2	These pulsatile forces may break up deeper plaque and contribute to compliance change of the diseased segment of the artery.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P57_S3	Together, these mechanistic components sufficiently remove or modify hard plaque, allowing for low pressure balloon inflation.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P57_S4	The orbital motion and speed of the eccentrically mounted crown increases, thus allowing for continuous reduction of plaque with differential sanding and pulsatile forces, as the opening of the lumen increases during the operation of the devices.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	The differential sanding of the OAS creates a smooth lumen surface, or channel, inside the vessel.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P58_S1	We believe that the smooth lumens created by the device increase the velocity of blood flow and decrease the resistance to blood flow, which may decrease the potential for restenosis, or re-narrowing of the arteries.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	Given the relative simplicity of the OAS, physicians and lab staff can usually set up and begin using the device in under two minutes.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	Physicians using the OAS employ techniques similar to those used in angioplasty, which are familiar to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists who are trained in endovascular techniques.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	The devices simple user interfaces require minimal additional training.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	Single Crown Treats Multiple Lesions in Various Sized Vessels.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P61_S1	Centrifugal force unique to OAS allows for a single access site to treat multiple lesions, in most cases.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P61_S2	In the coronary arteries, Coronary OAS is the only atherectomy device able to treat 2.5 to 4mm vessels with one device through a 6Fr radial approach.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	the OAS device is capable of treating multiple lesions in multiple arteries through a single access site, thus reducing the need for multiple devices or the need for multiple access sites.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	Because the particles of plaque sanded away are of such small sizes, the OAS does not require a collection reservoir that needs to be repeatedly emptied or cleaned during the procedure, which would potentially add time and cost to the procedure.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	The unique OAS mechanism of action used in both the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS can be used to treat multiple anatomic locations.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	Below-the-Knee and Behind-the-Knee Peripheral Artery Disease.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P66_S0	Arteries below and behind the knee are small in diameter and may be diffusely stenosed, calcified or both.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P66_S1	Reaching and treating these small vessels requires a low profile, which most competitive devices do not offer.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P67_S0	Behind-the-knee, or popliteal, lesions also present challenges if a stent is used because stents frequently fracture in this area due to the forces exerted on the vessels when the knee bends or flexes.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P67_S1	The Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS is effective in treating those vessels.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P67_S2	The Peripheral OAS offers a shorter shaft length (60cm), a smaller profile and a more flexible shaft than the predecessors for improved ease of use, and includes a 4 Fr catheter that enables physicians to access lesions below-the-knee using retrograde access (access through the ankle or foot).
1180145_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	Arteries above the knee are typically longer, straighter and wider than below-the-knee vessels.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P68_S1	Plaque in these arteries may also be diffuse, fibrotic and calcific.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	Physicians often use higher speeds or larger crown sizes of our products to treat lesions above the knee.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P70_S0	The individuals more at risk for being diagnosed with CAD are those that are suffering from high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, renal insufficiency, or have a family history of heart disease.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	The pathogenesis of CAD is marked by the accumulation of a fatty material called plaque on the walls of arteries that supply blood to the heart.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P71_S1	The plaque buildup causes the arteries to harden and narrow (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	The Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS is the only atherectomy device specifically indicated for severe coronary calcium.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P73_S0	The OAS has a short treatment time, typically less than two minutes.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	Single Crown Can Treat Various Lumen Sizes Helping Limit Hospital Costs.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P75_S0	The OAS orbital mechanism of action allows one device to treat various diameter lumens inside the artery.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P75_S1	Adjusting the rotational speed of the crown changes the orbit to create the desired lumen diameter, thereby potentially avoiding the need to use multiple catheters of different sizes to treat multiple lesions.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P76_S0	Treating complex, calcified lesions in the peripheral or coronary arteries remains difficult, particularly where patients may present challenging access sites.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P76_S1	The OAS allows for trans-radial access with benefits to both physicians and patients.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P76_S2	For physicians, this smaller access site provides lower vascular and bleeding complication rates, faster patient recovery time, and the ability to treat bilateral disease in one setting, address obese patients and work around previous, compromised access sites.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P76_S3	For patients, this contributes to comfort during- and post-operation, earlier ambulation, reduced risk of infection, and faster healing.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P77_S0	Many of the patients treated with the Peripheral OAS have advanced PAD and suffer from CLI.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P77_S1	These patients often have complex, calcified lesions in their lower leg, which are challenging to access and treat using the traditional femoral artery access site.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P77_S2	If left untreated, these cases may result in lower limb amputation.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P77_S3	CSI s family of 1.25mm Peripheral OASs with 4Fr compatibility allows for more options to treat those lesions by providing a low-profile system that is fully compatible with alternative access sites in the foot or ankle.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P77_S4	Smaller sheaths have been shown to reduce procedure times and decrease complications.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P78_S0	Our goal is to be the leading provider of low profile solutions for the treatment of peripheral and coronary artery disease.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P78_S1	The key elements of our strategy include:
1180145_17_ITEM1_P79_S0	Drive Adoption through Our Direct U.S. Sales Organization, Medical Education and Key Opinion Leaders.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P79_S1	We expect to continue to drive adoption of the OAS through our direct U.S. sales force in both hospital and office-based lab settings, which targets interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, and interventional radiologists.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P79_S2	As a key element of our strategy, we focus on educating physicians about the disease states and our clinical data, and training physicians regarding the proper use and application of OAS technology through physician faculty, our direct sales force and through seminars where physician industry leaders discuss case studies and treatment techniques using the devices.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P80_S0	Collect Additional Clinical Evidence on Safety, Effectiveness and Economic Benefits of the OAS.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P80_S1	Physicians and payers are increasingly requesting clinical and economic evidence to allow them to make decisions regarding optimal treatment of patients.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P80_S2	We are focused on collecting clinical and economic evidence to demonstrate the advantages of the OAS in treating complex disease states such as peripheral and coronary artery disease.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P80_S3	We believe that the clinical advantages and cost effectiveness of our OAS technology will help drive physician utilization of the OAS and sustain ongoing reimbursement coverage for our devices.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P81_S0	Enhance OAS and Expand Product Portfolio within the Market for Treatment of Peripheral and Coronary Arteries.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P82_S0	In addition to enhancing the OAS, we offer multiple accessory devices for use with the OAS.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P82_S1	We are continuing product development to further expand our portfolio of PAD and CAD treatment solutions.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P83_S0	In March 2017, we received regulatory approval for our coronary OAS Micro Crown device in Japan.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P83_S1	We are evaluating options for further international expansion to maximize the coronary and peripheral market opportunities.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P84_S0	In addition to adding to our product portfolio through internal development efforts, we intend to explore the acquisition of other product lines, technologies or companies that may leverage our sales force or complement our strategic objectives.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P84_S1	We also intend to explore distribution agreements, licensing transactions, manufacturing agreements and other strategic partnerships.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P85_S0	We study the most challenging patient populations and are committed to providing relevant clinical evidence that enables physicians to select and utilize the best treatment options for their patients.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P86_S0	A total of 5,735 subjects (4,764 PAD and 971 CAD) have been enrolled in our clinical studies as of June 30, 2017.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P86_S1	Our clinical studies incorporate rigorous long-term clinical and healthcare economic data that are critical to improving patient care and ongoing healthcare changes.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P87_S0	We have completed numerous clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Peripheral OAS.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P87_S1	The results of these studies consistently demonstrate that the Peripheral OAS provides predictable, repeatable and durable results that differentiate it from other PAD treatments.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P88_S0	The following PAD clinical studies were completed or in process during fiscal 2017:
1180145_17_ITEM1_P89_S0	This prospective, observational, multi-center clinical study is evaluating the procedural and long-term clinical, quality of life and economic outcomes of endovascular device interventions, including orbital atherectomy, for the treatment of PAD.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P89_S1	We expect the results from this study to increase our understanding of the clinical and economic outcomes of endovascular treatment for PAD patients, including those with the most advanced form of the disease, Rutherford Class 6.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P90_S0	Enrollment of 1,204 subjects at 51 sites in the U.S. was completed in February 2016.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P91_S0	LIBERTY 360 data were presented in February and August 2017.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P91_S1	The majority of devices used in the study were balloons and/or atherectomy, and the Peripheral OAS was the most frequently used atherectomy device.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P91_S2	The LIBERTY 360 data through one year demonstrated that peripheral interventions can be used successfully across all Rutherford classes, including the most challenging Rutherford Class 6 subjects.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P91_S3	Overall, the results of this novel all-comers PAD study suggest that peripheral vascular intervention ( PVI ) is an alternative to primary amputation in Rutherford Class 6 patients.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P91_S4	Additionally, data from the LIBERTY 360 study provide further evidence to support PVI treatment in Rutherford 2-5 patients.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P92_S0	This post-market, multi-center, randomized clinical study conducted in Europe is designed to evaluate the acute and long-term clinical outcomes of orbital atherectomy with adjunctive DCB angioplasty versus DCB angioplasty alone in PAD patients with calcified, below-the-knee lesions.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P92_S1	Fifty evaluable subjects will be enrolled in OPTIMIZE BTK and will be followed for up to two years.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P93_S0	We have conducted two clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Coronary OAS Classic Crown device: the ORBIT I feasibility study and the ORBIT II pivotal study.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P93_S1	The safety and efficacy of the Coronary OAS Micro Crown device were evaluated in the COAST study.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P94_S0	In fiscal 2017, we launched ECLIPSE, as described below.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P95_S0	The following CAD clinical studies were completed or in process during fiscal 2017:
1180145_17_ITEM1_P96_S0	This prospective, single-arm, multi-center, global Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE ) study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Coronary OAS Micro Crown in treating de novo , severely calcified lesions prior to stent implantation.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P96_S1	Enrollment of 100 patients, including 74 patients at 12 sites in the U.S. and 26 patients at five sites in Japan, was completed in July 2015.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P96_S2	The study results through one year were presented in February 2017.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P96_S3	The overall one-year MACE rate, defined as the composite of myocardial infarction ( MI ), cardiac death, and target vessel revascularization, was 22.2%.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P96_S4	The COAST MI rate did not increase from 30 days to one year, and low rates of one-year cardiac death (1.0%) and target lesion revascularization (6.3%) were reported.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P97_S0	This prospective, multi-center, non-randomized study assessed the outcomes of current standard of care treatment in none/mild, moderate, and severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P97_S1	Treatment of the target lesion excluded use of OAS.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P98_S0	Enrollment of 350 subjects was completed in September 2015.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P98_S1	The one-year results of the MACE study were presented in February 2017.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P98_S2	The MACE data through one year indicate that severe calcium is associated with higher short and long-term major adverse cardiac event rates compared to both none/mild and moderate calcification.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P99_S0	This post-market, randomized one-to-one, multi-center trial is designed to evaluate vessel preparation with OAS compared to conventional angioplasty technique prior to drug-eluting stent implantation for the treatment of severely calcified lesions.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P99_S1	Approximately 2,000 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 150 sites in the U.S. and subjects will be followed for up to two years.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P100_S0	The co-primary endpoints of acute minimum stent area (assessed by optical coherence tomography in a subset of 400 subjects) and one-year target vessel failure are powered to demonstrate superiority of OAS vessel preparation vs. conventional angioplasty.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P101_S0	Our clinical portfolio is expanding as we develop future studies to answer difficult questions about PAD and CAD treatment.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P101_S1	Our clinical research continues to highlight the safety and efficacy of the OAS and current and new research illustrates our versatility in the emerging vascular market.

1180145_17_ITEM1_P114_S3	We assemble the shaft, crown and handle components on-site, and test, pack, seal and label the finished assembly before sending the packaged product to a contract sterilization facility.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P114_S4	Upon return from the sterilizer, the product is held in inventory prior to shipping to our customers.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P115_S0	We are located in a 125,000-square-foot corporate headquarters in Minnesota, which we now lease.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P115_S1	This custom-designed building has space for more than 500 employees and contains dedicated research and development, training and education, and manufacturing facilities.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P115_S2	Depending on staffing, the facility has the annual capacity to produce in excess of 75,000 devices per shift.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P115_S3	The finished goods storage has capacity for approximately 20,000 devices and more than 500 saline infusion pumps, as well as other accessory products.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P116_S0	Our Pearland, Texas facility is 46,000 square feet and includes a custom-built clean room and production space for future expansion of value-add processes, including machining and electronics assembly.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P116_S1	The facility, when fully staffed and equipped, also has the annual capacity to produce approximately 75,000 devices per shift.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P116_S2	This facility has finished goods storage capacity for greater than 15,000 devices and other accessory products and over 500 saline infusion pumps.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P117_S0	We believe that our facilities in Minnesota and Texas will provide adequate production, assembly, and warehousing capacity for the foreseeable future.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P118_S0	We are registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P118_S1	We have opted to maintain quality assurance and quality management certifications to enable us to market our products in the member states of the European Union ( EU ), the European Free Trade Association and countries that have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements with the EU.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P118_S2	We are ISO 13485:2003 certified, and our renewal is due by December 2018.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P119_S0	FDA and our Notified Body for the EU CE Mark.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P119_S1	Our Stealth 360 has received CE Mark.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P119_S2	We are registered as a Foreign Medical Device Manufacturer in Japan and our registration certificate renewal is due by June 2021.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P120_S0	Third-party payors, including private insurers, and government insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, pay for a significant portion of patient care provided in the United States.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P120_S1	The single largest payor in the U.S. is the Medicare program, a federal governmental health insurance program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ).
1180145_17_ITEM1_P120_S2	Medicare covers certain medical care expenses for eligible elderly and disabled individuals, including a large percentage of the population with PAD and CAD who could be treated with the OAS.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P120_S3	In addition, private insurers often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P120_S4	Consequently, Medicare s coverage and reimbursement policies are important to our operations.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P121_S0	CMS has established Medicare reimbursement codes describing atherectomy products and procedures using atherectomy products.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P121_S1	We believe that physicians and hospitals that treat PAD and CAD with the respective OAS will generally be eligible to receive reimbursement from Medicare, as well as private insurers, for the cost of the single-use catheter and the physician s services.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P122_S0	The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P122_S1	Our OAS devices compete with a variety of other products or devices for the treatment of vascular disease, including stents, balloon angioplasty catheters and atherectomy catheters, as well as products used in vascular surgery.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P122_S2	Large competitors in the stent and balloon angioplasty market segments include Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific, Cook Medical, Johnson Johnson, BARD, and Medtronic.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P122_S3	We also compete against manufacturers of atherectomy catheters including, among others, Medtronic, Spectranetics, Boston Scientific, Philips, and Avinger, as well as manufacturers that may enter the market due to the increasing demand for treatment of vascular disease.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P122_S4	Other competitors include pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs for the treatment of PAD and CAD and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral and coronary bypass procedures.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P123_S0	We are not aware of any competing high-speed rotational atherectomy systems either currently on the market or in development that also generate an orbital motion with an eccentric solid abrasive crown to create lumens with diameters that are larger than the diameter of the abrasive crown itself.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P124_S0	Because of the size of the peripheral opportunities, competitors and potential competitors have historically dedicated significant resources to aggressively promote their products.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P124_S1	We believe that our Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS compete primarily on the basis of:
1180145_17_ITEM1_P125_S0	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and other intellectual property laws, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P125_S1	As of June 2017, we held 44 issued U.S. patents and have 39 U.S. patent applications pending, as well as 262 issued or granted foreign patents and 187 foreign patent applications, each of which corresponds to aspects of our U.S. patents and applications.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P125_S2	Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2017 and 2035, and our patents covering the core technology begin to expire in 2023 while providing core technology coverage through 2035.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P125_S3	We have many additional patents relating to our core technology currently pending in the USPTO, which will extend our key covered subject matter and coverage dates significantly.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P125_S4	Our issued patents and patent applications relate primarily to the design and operation of interventional atherectomy devices, including the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P125_S5	These patents and applications include claims covering key aspects of orbital atherectomy devices, including the design, manufacture and therapeutic use of certain atherectomy abrasive heads, drive shafts, control systems, handles and couplings.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P126_S0	the design, manufacture and therapeutic uses of atherectomy devices.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P126_S1	In addition, we hold 19 registered U.S. trademarks, 12 registered marks in the Madrid Protocol with protection granted within at least one of Australia, Europe, China, Japan and Mexico, six registered marks in Europe, five registered marks in Canada, five registered marks in Mexico, and eight registered marks in Hong Kong.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P126_S2	We have three trademark applications pending in the U.S., eight trademark applications pending in Canada and 12 trademark applications pending in India.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P127_S0	We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P127_S1	We seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P127_S2	Agreements with our employees also forbid them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P127_S3	We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P128_S0	Governmental authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local levels and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of medical devices such as the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P129_S0	Failure to obtain approval to market our products under development and to meet the ongoing requirements of these regulatory authorities could prevent us from marketing and continuing to market our products.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P130_S0	The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( FDCA ) and the FDA s implementing regulations govern medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post market surveillance.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P130_S1	Medical devices and their manufacturers are also subject to inspection by the FDA.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P130_S2	The FDCA, supplemented by other federal and state laws, also provides civil and criminal penalties for violations of its provisions.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P131_S0	Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P132_S0	The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization are premarket notification (also called 510(k) clearance) and PMA.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P133_S0	To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device legally marketed in the United States.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P133_S1	A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P133_S2	A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P134_S0	Generally, the 510(k) clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a year or more.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P135_S0	After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA (if the device as modified is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device).
1180145_17_ITEM1_P135_S1	The determination as to whether new authorization is needed is initially left to the manufacturer; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P135_S2	The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P136_S0	We received 510(k) clearance for use of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral as a therapy in patients with PAD in the U.S. in August 2007.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P136_S1	We received additional 510(k) clearances for the control unit used with the Diamondback 360 Peripheral on October 25, 2007 and for the solid crown version of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral in November 2007.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P136_S2	We were granted 510(k) clearance of the Predator 360 in March 2009 and Stealth 360 in March 2011.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P136_S3	We received 510(k) clearance of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral 1.25 Micro in November 2013 and the Diamondback 360 60cm Peripheral in February 2014.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P136_S4	The Diamondback 360 Low Profile Peripheral received FDA clearance in April 2015.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P136_S5	We received clearance of the ViperWire Advance Flex Tip Guide Wire in June 2015.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P136_S6	The Diamondback 360 1.50 Peripheral and Diamondback 360 2.00 Peripheral were each granted 510(k) clearance in October 2015.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P137_S0	A PMA application requires the payment of significant user fees and must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P137_S1	A PMA application must also include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P138_S0	After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P138_S1	During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P138_S2	Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P138_S3	In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with the FDA s Quality System Regulation ( QSR ), which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P139_S0	FDA review of a PMA application is required by statute to take no longer than 180 days, although the process typically takes significantly longer, and may require several years to complete.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P139_S1	The FDA can delay, limit, or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
1180145_17_ITEM1_P140_S0	changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P141_S0	If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P141_S1	When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P141_S2	If the FDA s evaluation of the PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny PMA or issue a not approvable letter.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P141_S3	The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA application.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P141_S4	Even if a PMA application is approved, the FDA may approve the device with an indication that is narrower or more limited than originally sought.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P141_S5	The agency can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of the device as a condition of approval, or impose post approval requirements such as continuing evaluation and periodic reporting on the safety, efficacy, and reliability of the device for its intended use.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P142_S0	New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P142_S1	PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P143_S0	Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P143_S1	These trials generally require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P143_S2	The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P143_S3	The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P143_S4	Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P144_S0	FDA approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P144_S1	With certain exceptions, changes made to an investigational plan after an IDE is approved must be submitted in an IDE supplement and approved by FDA (and by governing institutional review boards when appropriate) prior to implementation.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P145_S0	All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with regulations and requirements collectively known as Good Clinical Practice.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P145_S1	Good clinical practices include the FDA s IDE regulations, which describe the conduct of clinical trials with medical devices, including the recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of sponsors and investigators, and labeling of investigational devices.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P145_S2	They also prohibit promotion, test marketing or commercialization of an investigational device and any representation that such a device is safe or effective for the purposes being investigated.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P145_S3	Good clinical practices also include the FDA s regulations for institutional review board approval and for protection of human subjects (such as informed consent), as well as disclosure of financial interests by clinical investigators.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P146_S0	Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P146_S1	The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P146_S2	The commencement or completion of any clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application or clearance of a premarket notification for numerous reasons.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P147_S0	After a device is cleared or approved for use and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P148_S0	product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device that may present a risk to health.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P149_S0	In addition, the FDA may require a company to conduct post market surveillance studies or order it to establish and maintain a system for tracking its products through the chain of distribution to the patient level.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P150_S0	Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions:
1180145_17_ITEM1_P151_S0	We and our contract manufacturers, specification developers and suppliers are also required to manufacture our products in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements set forth in the QSR.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P152_S0	The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing and record keeping.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P152_S1	The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P152_S2	If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers is not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to clear or approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P152_S3	Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P153_S0	In April 2017, we initiated a voluntary recall of one type of our saline infusion pumps.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P153_S1	We plan to recall and replace approximately 900 units that were in customer inventory at the time the recall commenced.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P153_S2	As of June 30, 2017, we had approximately 338 pumps remaining to be replaced.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P154_S0	Our operations are directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the FDCA, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P154_S1	These laws may impact, among other things, our sales, marketing, education and clinical programs.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P154_S2	In addition, these laws may require us to screen individuals and other companies, suppliers and vendors in order to ensure that they are not debarred by the federal government and, therefore, prohibited from doing business in the healthcare industry.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P155_S0	The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P155_S1	Several courts have interpreted the statute s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P156_S0	The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P156_S1	Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P157_S0	The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P157_S1	Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P158_S0	In addition to the laws described above, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P159_S0	The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P159_S1	The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P160_S0	On June 28, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the U.S. government, acting through the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Western District of North Carolina (the DOJ ) and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (the OIG ) and Travis Thams to resolve the DOJ investigation of whether we violated the False Claims Act.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P160_S1	In connection with the resolution of this matter, we entered into a five-year corporate integrity agreement (the Corporate Integrity Agreement ) with the OIG.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P160_S2	The Corporate Integrity Agreement requires that we maintain our existing compliance programs and imposes certain expanded compliance-related requirements during the term of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, including establishment of specific procedures and requirements regarding consulting activities, co-marketing activities and other interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare institutions and the sale and marketing of our products; ongoing monitoring, reporting, certification and training obligations; and the engagement of an independent review organization to perform certain auditing and reviews and prepare certain reports regarding our compliance with federal health care programs.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P161_S0	The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, and certain state laws require persons to collect and report certain data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P161_S1	It is widely anticipated that public reporting under the Sunshine Act and implementing Open Payment regulations will result in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P162_S0	Voluntary industry codes, federal guidance documents and a variety of state laws address the tracking and reporting of marketing practices relative to gifts given and other expenditures made to doctors and other healthcare professionals.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P162_S1	In addition to impacting our marketing and educational programs, our internal business processes are and will continue to be affected by the numerous legal requirements and regulatory guidance at the state, federal and industry levels.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P163_S0	International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P163_S1	The time required to obtain approval in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P163_S2	For example, the primary regulatory environment in Europe with respect to medical devices is that of the EU, which includes most of the major countries in Europe.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P163_S3	Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the EU with respect to medical devices.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P164_S0	Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the EU, although actual implementation of these directives may vary on a country-by-country basis.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P165_S0	The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of submission of a design dossier, self-assessment by the manufacturer, a third-party assessment, and review of the design dossier by a Notified Body.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P165_S1	This third-party assessment generally consists of an audit of the manufacturer s quality system and manufacturing site, as well as review of the technical documentation used to support application of the CE Mark to one s product and possibly specific testing of the manufacturer s product.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P165_S2	An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the EU is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the EU.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P166_S0	In July 2016, we submitted an application to Japan s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency ( PMDA ) for approval of our Coronary OAS Micro Crown and received approval in March 2017.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P166_S1	Pending reimbursement approval, Japan will become the first international market for any CSI product.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P166_S2	As part of our anticipated Japan commercialization process we will be subject to the requirements of the Japanese Act on Securing Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, Regenerative and Cellular Therapy Products, Gene Therapy Products, and Cosmetics (the PMD Act ).
1180145_17_ITEM1_P166_S3	Our quality management system and products will be subject to review and examination by PMDA and subject to approval and enforcement by Japan s MHLW.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P166_S4	The critical suppliers named in our application will also be subject to this review and examination for the activities they perform for us.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P167_S0	Non-compliance with the PMD Act could result in revocation or suspension of our license, revocation of approvals, and criminal sanctions such as fines and/or imprisonment.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P168_S0	In addition, any international expansion, operations and sales that we undertake will require us to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions and with U.S. and foreign export control, trade embargo and custom laws.
1180145_17_ITEM1_P169_S0	Our operations are subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances.

1180145_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We have a history of net losses and a short commercialization experience, and we are likely to continue to incur losses.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We are not profitable and have incurred net losses in each fiscal year since our formation in 1989.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In particular, we had net losses of $ 1.8 million , $56.0 million , and $32.8 million for the years ended June 30, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	As of June 30, 2017 , we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $329.3 million .
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	We commenced commercial sales of the Peripheral OAS in September 2007 and the Coronary OAS in October 2013, and our short commercialization experience makes it difficult for us to predict future performance.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	We expect to continue to incur significant expenses for sales and marketing, research and development, and manufacturing as we continue to commercialize the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS and develop and commercialize future versions of the Peripheral OAS, the Coronary OAS, and any future products.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Additionally, we expect that our general and administrative expenses may increase to support business growth.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S6	We instituted a number of cost reduction initiatives in the year ended June 30, 2016, which, combined with revenue growth, significantly reduced our net loss in fiscal 2017 and may reduce our net losses in future periods.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S7	However, if we are unable to balance revenue growth and cost management, our operating losses are likely to continue.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We may be unable to sustain our historical revenue growth.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Other than a 4.9% decline in revenue from sales of our Peripheral OAS during fiscal 2016, our revenue from sales of our OAS devices has grown in each of the fiscal years since we began commercialization in September 2007.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our ability to increase our revenues in future periods will depend on our ability to increase sales of the OAS devices and improved products we introduce, which will, in turn, depend in part on our success in growing our customer base and reorders from those customers.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We may not be able to generate, sustain or increase revenues on a quarterly or annual basis.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	If we cannot achieve or sustain revenue growth for an extended period, our financial results will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Economic conditions may adversely affect our business.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Adverse worldwide economic conditions may negatively impact our business.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	A significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of our customers could cause unfavorable trends in their purchases and also in our receivable collections and additional allowances may be required, which could adversely affect our operating results.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Adverse worldwide economic conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers ability to provide us with materials and components, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Peripheral OAS, the Coronary OAS and future products may never achieve broad market acceptance.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The Peripheral OAS, the Coronary OAS, and future products we may develop or market may never gain broad market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The degree of market acceptance of any of our products will depend on a number of factors, including:
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	our reputation among physicians and hospitals.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Failure of the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS to significantly penetrate current or new markets would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our customers may not be able to achieve adequate reimbursement for using the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS, which could affect the acceptance of our products and cause our business to suffer.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved medical devices and procedures is uncertain.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The commercial success of our products is substantially dependent on whether third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement for the use of such products and related services are available.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We expect our products to continue to be purchased by hospitals and other providers who will then seek reimbursement from various public and private third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers, for the services provided to patients.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	While third-party payors are currently providing reimbursement for our products, we can give no assurance that these third-party payors will continue to provide adequate reimbursement for use of the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS to permit hospitals and doctors to consider the products cost-effective for patients requiring treatment, or that current reimbursement levels for our products will continue.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	In addition, the overall amount of reimbursement available for PAD and CAD treatment could decrease in the future.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain sufficient reimbursement could cause our business to suffer.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement, and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for use of our products.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In order to position our products for acceptance by third-party payors, we may have to agree to lower prices than we might otherwise charge.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Governmental and private sector payors have instituted initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs using, for example, price regulation or controls and competitive pricing programs.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Some third-party payors also require demonstrated superiority, on the basis of randomized clinical trials, or pre-approval of coverage, for new or innovative devices or procedures before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such devices or procedures.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	It is uncertain whether our current products or any future products we may develop will be viewed as sufficiently cost-effective to warrant adequate coverage and reimbursement levels.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In addition, in June 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the U.S. government, acting through the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina (the DOJ ) and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (the OIG ), and Travis Thams, and a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement with the OIG.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In the event of a breach of the Settlement Agreement or the Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could be excluded from participation in federal health care programs.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products is limited or not available, the acceptance of our products and, consequently, our business will be substantially harmed.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Healthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	There have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control healthcare costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system, some of which have been enacted into law, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Patient Act.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The Patient Act and any additional healthcare proposals and laws that may be enacted in the future could also limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The Patient Act and future healthcare legislation could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The U.S. Congress has been considering legislation to repeal, modify or replace the Patient Act.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We cannot predict the outcome of these efforts and, as a result, we cannot predict the effect that any such repeal, modification or replacement will have on our business and results of operations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our financial performance may be adversely affected by medical device tax provisions in the health care reform legislation.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The imposition of the 2.3% medical device excise tax enacted as part of the Patient Act has adversely affected our financial results and has required, and will continue to require, us to identify ways to reduce spending in other areas or raise additional capital to offset the increased expense.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Although the excise tax has been suspended by Congress until the end of 2017, its status is unclear for 2018 and subsequent years.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We have not been able to pass along the cost of the tax to our customers or offset the cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting from the expansion of health insurance coverage and do not expect to be able to do so in the future.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Ongoing implementation of this legislation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We have limited data and experience regarding the safety and efficacy of the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Any long-term data that is generated may not be positive or consistent with our limited short-term data, which would affect market acceptance of these products.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Because our technology is relatively new in the treatment of PAD and CAD, we have performed clinical trials only with limited patient populations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The long-term effects of using the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS in a large number of patients have not been studied and the results of short-term clinical use of the Peripheral OAS or the Coronary OAS do not necessarily predict long-term clinical benefits or reveal long-term adverse effects.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We are conducting and developing several clinical trials, and there are substantial risks and uncertainties involved in these trials.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We must devote substantial resources to our clinical trials, clinical trials often take several years to develop and conduct, there are difficulties involved in locating sites and patients to participate in our clinical trials, and the results of every trial are uncertain until the trial is completed.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P21_S4	These uncertainties could adversely impact our financial results, our reputation and the reputation of our products.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Clinical trials conducted with the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS have involved procedures performed by physicians who are very technically proficient.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Consequently, both short and long-term results reported in these studies may be significantly more favorable than typical results achieved by physicians, which could negatively impact market acceptance of the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS and materially harm our business.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We face significant competition, must innovate to stay competitive, and may be unable to sell the Peripheral OAS or the Coronary OAS at profitable levels.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The market for medical devices is highly competitive, dynamic and marked by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovation.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our ability to compete depends on our ability to innovate successfully, and, while certain barriers exist to entry into our market, we cannot assure that new entrants or existing competitors will not be able to develop products that compete directly with our products.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We compete against very large and well-known stent and balloon angioplasty device manufacturers, atherectomy catheter manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral and coronary bypass procedures.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	We may have difficulty competing effectively with these competitors because of their well-established positions in the marketplace, significant financial and human capital resources, established reputations and worldwide distribution channels.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	develop more effective or less expensive products or technologies that render our technology or products obsolete or non-competitive.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We have encountered and expect to continue to encounter potential customers who, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to or prefer the products offered by these competitors.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In addition, increased consolidation in the healthcare industry has resulted in companies with greater market power, which increases competition for goods and services.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We experience significant competition on the pricing of our products and expect to continue to experience pressure from our customers to lower our prices.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our customers may require lower pricing in connection with contract renewals or otherwise for us to continue to sell our products to them.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Our Purchasing Agreement with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, L.P. expires on January 31, 2018.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	If we are unable to renew this agreement at favorable pricing levels or at all, our financial results will be materially adversely affected.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	If we are unable to compete successfully, our revenue will suffer.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Increased competition might lead to price reductions and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Competitive pressures may decrease the demand for our products and could adversely affect our financial results.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We have limited commercial manufacturing experience and could experience difficulty in producing the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS or may need to depend on third parties to manufacture the products.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We have limited experience in commercially manufacturing the Peripheral OAS, even less experience in commercially manufacturing the Coronary OAS and no experience manufacturing these products in the volume that we anticipate will be required if we achieve planned levels of commercial sales.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	As a result, we may not be able to develop and implement efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to manufacture the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS or future products in significant volumes, while meeting the legal, regulatory, quality, price, durability, engineering, design and production standards required to market our products successfully.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The forecasts of demand we use to determine order quantities and lead times for components purchased from outside suppliers may be incorrect.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our failure to obtain required components or subassemblies when needed and at a reasonable cost would adversely affect our business.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In addition, we may in the future need to depend upon third parties to manufacture the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS and future products.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Any difficulties in locating and hiring third-party manufacturers, or in the ability of third-party manufacturers to supply quantities of our products at the times and in the quantities we need, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We depend upon third-party suppliers, including single source suppliers to us and our customers, making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We rely on third-party suppliers to provide us with certain components of our products and to provide key components or supplies to our customers for use with our products.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We rely on single source suppliers for certain components of the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS, including the diamond-grit-coated crown and our ViperSlide Lubricant.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In some cases, we do not have long-term supply agreements with, or guaranteed commitments from, our suppliers, including single source suppliers.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	We depend on our suppliers to provide us and our customers with materials in a timely manner that meet our and their quality, quantity and cost requirements.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P34_S4	These suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand and our customers demands.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P34_S5	These suppliers may cease producing the components we purchase from them or otherwise decide to cease doing business with us.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Any supply interruption from our suppliers or failure to obtain additional suppliers for any of the components used in our products would limit our ability to manufacture our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We are dependent on our senior management team and highly skilled personnel, and our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain personnel necessary for our success.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We are highly dependent on our senior management and other key personnel.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Our success will depend on our ability to retain senior management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, including sales and marketing professionals, scientists, clinical specialists, engineers and other highly skilled personnel and to integrate current and additional personnel in all departments.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	The loss of members of our senior management, sales and marketing professionals, scientists, clinical and regulatory specialists and engineers could prevent us from achieving our objectives of continuing to grow our company.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P37_S3	We do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We have increased the size of our organization and may need to do so in the future, and we may experience difficulties managing growth.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business, our future revenue and operating results may be adversely affected.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We have significantly expanded the size of our organization over the past three years, particularly in the number of sales and marketing personnel, and may need to do so in the future.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The growth we may experience in the future may provide challenges to our organization, requiring us to also rapidly expand other aspects of our business, including our manufacturing operations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Rapid expansion in personnel may result in less experienced people producing and selling our products, which could result in unanticipated costs and disruptions to our operations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P39_S3	If we cannot scale and manage our business appropriately, our anticipated growth may be impaired and our financial results will suffer.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We intend to sell our products internationally in the future, but we may experience difficulties in obtaining approval to do so or in successfully marketing our products internationally even if approved.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Currently, all of our revenues are in the United States; however, we intend to sell internationally in the future.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	There can be no guarantee that we will receive approval to sell our products internationally, nor can there be any guarantee that any sales would result even if such approval is received.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	In addition, we will incur substantial expenses in connection with international expansion.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Our inability to successfully enter international markets and manage business on a global scale could negatively affect our financial results.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We may require additional financing, and our failure to obtain additional financing when needed could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We may be dependent on additional financing to execute our business plan.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In the event we need or desire additional financing, we may be unable to obtain it by borrowing money in the credit markets or raising money in the capital markets.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P43_S3	If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, we may terminate or delay the development of one or more of our products, or delay establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We face a risk of non-compliance with the financial covenants in our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We are party to a loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	This agreement requires us to maintain, among other things, either (i) minimum unrestricted cash at Silicon Valley Bank and unused availability on our line of credit of at least $10.0 million or (ii) minimum trailing three-month Adjusted EBITDA of $1.0 million and contains customary events of default, including, among others, the failure to comply with certain covenants or other agreements.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, amounts due under the agreements may be accelerated by Silicon Valley Bank.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	If we are unable to meet the financial or other covenants under the current loan and security agreement or negotiate future waivers or amendments of such covenants, events of default could occur under the agreement.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the agreement, Silicon Valley Bank has available a range of remedies customary in these circumstances, including declaring all outstanding debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to be due and payable, foreclosing on the assets securing the agreement and/or ceasing to provide additional loans under our line of credit, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The restrictive covenants under this agreement could limit our ability to obtain future financing, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	The financial and restrictive covenants contained in this agreement could also adversely affect our ability to respond to changing economic and business conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies that may be subject to fewer restrictions.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Transactions that we may view as important opportunities, such as acquisitions, may be subject to the consent of Silicon Valley Bank, which consent may be withheld or granted subject to conditions specified at the time that may affect the attractiveness or viability of the transaction.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We lease our corporate headquarters, which subjects us to ongoing payment obligations and compliance with certain covenants.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	On March 30, 2017, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	In connection with such sale, we entered into a lease agreement for our corporate headquarters, which has an initial term of fifteen years, with four consecutive renewal options of five years each.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Under this lease, we are obligated to pay a base annual rent in the first year of $1,637,500 with annual escalations of 3%.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P49_S3	If we are unable to make such rent payments or comply with the other covenants contained in the lease, the landlord could take certain actions against us, up to and including termination of the lease, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial conditions.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our stock price is volatile and subject to significant fluctuations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Market prices for securities of early-stage pharmaceutical, medical device, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Our common stock traded as low as $18.00 and as high as $33.11 per share during the 12-month period ended June 30, 2017 .
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Moreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We currently are involved in litigation, and may face future claims, that could adversely affect our business and financial results, divert management s attention from our business, and subject us to significant liabilities.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We are party to Shoemaker v. Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. et al. , a stockholder securities lawsuit.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	On March 29, 2017, the court granted our motion to dismiss the complaint in this action and dismissed the plaintiffs amended complaint without prejudice.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P55_S2	The court granted the plaintiffs request for leave to amend their complaint, and on June 27, 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P55_S3	The amended complaint makes similar allegations as the original complaint, namely, that we made materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about our business, operational and financial performance, in violation of federal securities laws, relating to alleged kickbacks to health care providers.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P55_S4	The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the alleged class, interest, and attorney s fees and costs of litigation.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P55_S5	We filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on August 11, 2017.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Although we believe that this lawsuit is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously, we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	It is possible that it could cause us to incur substantial costs and that it could be resolved adversely to us, result in substantial damages, result in or be connected to additional claims, and divert management s attention and resources, any of which could harm our business.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P56_S2	While we maintain director and officer liability insurance, the amount of insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover these claims and other claims to which we may become subject, and the continued availability of this insurance cannot be assured.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition and could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The outcome of recent employment litigation recently decided against us could adversely affect our business and financial results, divert management s attention from our business, and subject us to significant liabilities.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We are party to Steven Babyak v. Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. , a lawsuit originally filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, on November 16, 2015.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	The plaintiff, a former Regional Sales Manager, made claims under California law relating to whistleblower retaliation; defamation; discrimination on the basis of association with protected group; harassment on the basis of sex in violation of FEHA; retaliation for exercising rights under FEHA; failure to prevent discrimination, harassment and retaliation in violation of FEHA; wrongful termination in violation of public policy; and violation of business and professions code.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Following an April 2017 trial, a jury awarded the plaintiff $2.7 million in compensatory damages with respect to his claims for whistleblower retaliation and wrongful termination in violation of public policy.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P58_S3	The jury also awarded the plaintiff $22.4 million in punitive damages with respect to the same claims.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We filed post-trial motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial, on the grounds that this case was incorrectly decided as to liability, the compensatory and punitive damages were not appropriate and were excessive, and we were prevented from a fair trial by the improper exclusion of critical evidence.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P59_S1	On June 29, 2017, the Court partially granted our motions, reducing the punitive damages award from $22.4 million to $2.7 million but denied our other motions.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P59_S2	We filed a Notice of Appeal on July 24, 2017.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Although we believe that this case was incorrectly decided and intend to vigorously challenge the verdict, we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of this case.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	This case has generated negative publicity against us, which could cause us reputational harm.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	management s attention and resources, any of which could harm our business.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Protracted litigation, both with respect to the challenge and appeal of this case and any new claims that may arise relating to this case, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition and could subject us to additional adverse publicity and reputational harm and require us to incur significant legal fees.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P61_S2	While we have insurance coverage relating to this case, there can be no assurance that the amounts available under such insurance will be sufficient to cover any payments we may ultimately be required to make.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, the corporation s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by 5-percent shareholders that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We may have experienced an ownership change in the past and we may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock, some of which may be outside our control.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P65_S1	As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards or other pre-change tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	An interruption in or breach of security of our information or manufacturing systems could cause a loss of business or damage to our reputation.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We rely on information and communication systems in our manufacturing and in the conduct our business.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P67_S1	If there is any failure or interruption of these systems, such an incident could cause failures or disruptions in our customer relationship systems or product manufacturing.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P67_S2	In addition, we could be subject to a cyber incident, such as an intentional attack or an unintentional event that involves a third party gaining unauthorized access to our systems, which could disrupt our operations, corrupt our data, or result in release of our confidential information.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P67_S3	The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or cyber incidents could cause a loss of business or damage to our reputation and have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Our ability to market the Peripheral OAS in the United States is limited to use as a therapy in patients with PAD and our ability to market the Coronary OAS in the United States is limited to use as a therapy in patients with severely calcified CAD, and if we want to expand our marketing claims, we will need to file for additional FDA clearances or approvals and conduct further clinical trials, which would be expensive and time consuming and may not be successful.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We received FDA 510(k) clearances in the U.S. for use of the Peripheral OAS as a therapy in patients with PAD, and we received PMA to use the Coronary OAS as a therapy in patients with severely calcified CAD.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P69_S1	These general clearances and approvals restrict our ability to market or advertise the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS beyond these uses and could affect our growth.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	If we determine to market our orbital technology in the U.S. for other uses, we would need to conduct further clinical trials and obtain premarket approval from the FDA.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Clinical trials are complex, expensive, time consuming, uncertain and subject to substantial and unanticipated delays.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P70_S2	There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain FDA approval to use our orbital atherectomy technology for applications other than the treatment of PAD and CAD.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We are or will be subject to an extensive set of post-market controls that apply to us as we commercialize our products, including annual PMA reports, Medical Device Reports on serious adverse events, complaint handling and analysis under the FDA s QSR, export controls, advertising and promotion requirements, and potential post-market studies required by the FDA.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We and our suppliers are also subject to regulation by various state authorities, which may inspect our or our suppliers facilities and manufacturing processes and enforce state regulations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Failure to comply with applicable state regulations may result in seizures, injunctions or other types of enforcement actions.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our promotion of the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS is closely controlled by the FDA and enforcement activities could limit our ability to inform potential customers of the features of the products.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The Peripheral OAS or the Coronary OAS may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation and product liability claims that could exceed the limits of available insurance coverage.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	The FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material regulatory deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P75_S1	For example, since commercialization of the Peripheral OAS, we have had minor instances of recalls, including, in the year ended June 30, 2017 minor recalls involving guidewires and the OAS saline infusion pump recall discussed below.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Any recalls of our products or products that we distribute would divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation with customers and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Also, if the Peripheral OAS or the Coronary OAS is defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contain defective components or are misused, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P76_S1	The use, misuse or off-label use of the Peripheral OAS or the Coronary OAS may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P76_S2	We cannot prevent a physician from using the Peripheral OAS or the Coronary OAS for off-label applications.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P76_S3	While we have product liability insurance coverage for our products and intend to maintain such insurance coverage in the future, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected from claims that are brought against us.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	The recall of our saline infusion pumps could adversely affect our business and financial results, harm our reputation and result in legal claims against us.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	In April 2017, we initiated a voluntary recall of one type of our saline infusion pumps.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P78_S1	We plan to recall and replace approximately 900 units that were in customer inventory at the time the recall commenced.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P78_S2	While we have made design changes to this pump to address the issues that led to the recall, it is possible that we did not adequately assess the cause and effect of these issues and we may not have adequately modified the pump design in order to prevent these issues from happening in the future.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P78_S3	We cannot predict or control any future actions by the FDA and other regulatory bodies with respect to this recall.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P78_S4	We may experience delays in obtaining components of the pump from suppliers, which could cause delays in manufacturing replacement pumps, and we may not be able to replace all affected pumps in a timely manner.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P78_S5	We could also discover additional versions or lots of our pumps that could be subject to recall.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P78_S6	There can be no assurance that the FDA will approve any future designs and versions of the pump.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P78_S7	Any of these matters could cause delays in the ability of our customers to perform procedures using our devices and prevent us from adding new customers who may not have access to other pumps that can be used in procedures, which could harm our reputation with customers, adversely affect our ability to generate revenue, and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P78_S8	The existence of the recall could harm our reputation, which could result in loss of both current and potential customers.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P78_S9	This recall is diverting managerial and sales force attention and financial resources from other aspects of our business and may require us to incur more expense than we currently anticipate.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P78_S10	In addition, this recall and any effects of it could subject us to legal claims or proceedings that would divert managerial and financial resources and could adversely impact our business and financial condition.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P78_S11	While we carry liability insurance coverage and intend to maintain such insurance coverage in the future, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected from claims that are brought against us with respect to this recall.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We are subject to many laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS and related manufacturing processes, clinical data, adverse events, recalls and corrections and promotional activities are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory bodies.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P80_S1	In particular, we are required to comply with the QSR and other regulations, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product for which we obtain marketing clearance or approval.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P80_S2	We are also responsible for the quality of components received by our suppliers.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P80_S3	Failure to comply with the QSR requirements or other statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or failure to adequately respond to any observations, could result in, among other things:
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	If any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales to suffer.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Our operations are also subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P83_S0	In addition, our relationships with physicians, hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny under various federal anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws, as further described below.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P84_S0	If our operations are found to be in violation of these laws, we, as well as our employees, may be subject to penalties, including monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration health programs, workers compensation programs and TRICARE (the healthcare system administered by or on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense for uniformed services beneficiaries, including active duty and their dependents, retirees and their dependents), and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P85_S0	In addition, we have agreements with federal, state and local government agencies, such as the Veterans Administration, and third-party healthcare providers that receive government funding to sell our products.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P85_S1	We are subject to extensive regulatory compliance obligations in the award, performance and administration of our government contracts, including regulations relating to procurement integrity, pricing protection, export control, government security, employment practices, accuracy of records and the recording of costs.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P85_S2	The other parties to these agreements have the right to audit us to determine whether we are in compliance with these agreements.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P85_S3	Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, repayment of amounts, the assessment of penalties and fines, and/or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting in the future, any of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting kickbacks and false and fraudulent claims which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Additionally, any challenges to or investigations into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P87_S0	The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, and similar state laws, prohibit payments that are intended to induce health care professionals or others either to refer patients or to purchase, lease, order or arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease or order of healthcare products or services.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P87_S1	A number of states have enacted laws that require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report payments, gifts and other remuneration made to physicians and other health care professionals and health care organizations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P87_S2	In addition, some state statutes, most notably laws in Massachusetts and Vermont, impose outright bans on certain gifts to physicians as well as requiring reporting of payments to physicians.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P87_S3	Some of these laws, referred to as aggregate spend or gift laws, carry substantial fines if they are violated.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P88_S0	The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, requires us to collect and report certain data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P89_S0	It is widely anticipated that public reporting under the Sunshine Act and implementing Open Payments regulations will result in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P90_S0	These anti-kickback, public reporting and aggregate spend laws affect our sales, marketing, promotional and clinical activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers or users of medical devices.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P90_S1	They also impose additional administrative and compliance burdens on us.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P90_S2	In particular, these laws influence, among other things, how we structure our sales offerings, including discount practices, customer support, education and training programs, physician consulting and other service arrangements, and clinical trials.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P90_S3	If we were to offer or pay inappropriate inducements to purchase our products, we could be subject to a claim under the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute or similar state laws.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P90_S4	If we fail to comply with particular reporting requirements, we could be subject to penalties under applicable federal or state laws.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P90_S5	Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payments to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or for items or services that were not provided as claimed.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P90_S6	Although we do not submit claims directly to government healthcare programs or other payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims by providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, by providing improper financial inducements, or through certain other activities.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P91_S0	In providing billing and coding information to customers, we make every effort to ensure that the billing and coding information furnished is accurate and that treating physicians understand that they are responsible for all treatment decisions.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P91_S1	Nevertheless, we cannot provide assurance that the government will regard any billing errors that may be made as inadvertent or that the government will not examine our role in providing information to our customers and physicians concerning the benefits of therapy with our devices.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P91_S2	Likewise, our financial relationships with customers, physicians, or others in a position to influence the purchase or use of our products may be subject to government scrutiny or be alleged or found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P92_S0	False claims laws prescribe civil, criminal and administrative penalties for noncompliance, which can be substantial.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P92_S1	Moreover, an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business and results of operations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P93_S0	On May 8, 2014, we received a letter from the DOJ stating that it is investigating us to determine whether we had violated the False Claims Act, and on June 28, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the United States of America, acting through the DOJ and on behalf of the OIG, and Travis Thams, who filed the qui tam complaint underlying the DOJ s investigation (the Civil Action ), to resolve the investigation by the DOJ and the Civil Action.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P93_S1	The existence of the investigation and subsequent settlement could negatively affect our reputation and harm our business and results of operations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P93_S2	In addition, the release we received from the government in the Settlement Agreement related to particular conduct alleged in the complaint underlying the investigation.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P93_S3	If the government determines that other conduct alleged in the complaint for which the government did not grant us a release merits additional investigation or if the government pursues any action against us relating to this other alleged conduct, then we may need to expend additional amounts to defend ourselves, our management would undergo the distraction of additional investigation and potential litigation, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Compliance with the terms and conditions of our Corporate Integrity Agreement requires significant resources and management time and, if we fail to comply, we could be subject to penalties or, under certain circumstances, excluded from government healthcare programs, which would materially adversely affect our business.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P95_S0	On June 28, 2016, we entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement with the OIG.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P95_S1	The Corporate Integrity Agreement requires that we maintain our existing compliance programs and imposes certain expanded compliance-related requirements during the term of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, including establishment of specific procedures and requirements regarding consulting activities, co-marketing activities and other interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare institutions and the sale and marketing of our products; ongoing monitoring, reporting, certification and training obligations; and the engagement of an independent review organization to perform certain auditing and reviews and prepare certain reports regarding our compliance with federal health care programs.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P95_S2	Maintaining the broad array of processes, policies and procedures necessary to comply with the Corporate Integrity Agreement will require a significant portion of management s attention and the application of significant resources.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P95_S3	The costs associated with implementation of and compliance with the Corporate Integrity Agreement could be substantial and may be greater than we currently anticipate.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P95_S4	In addition, while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program, we cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants or our contractors are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and/or laws, all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or laws and/or all requirements of the Corporate Integrity Agreement.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P95_S5	In the event of a breach of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could become liable for payment of certain stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal health care programs.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P95_S6	The costs associated with compliance with the Corporate Integrity Agreement, or any liability or consequences associated with its breach, could have an adverse effect on our business, revenues, earnings and cash flows.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses, may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries, as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P97_S1	These disclosure requirements require ongoing due diligence efforts and disclosure obligations.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P97_S2	There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P97_S3	In addition, our ongoing implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Our anticipated international expansion will subject us to increased legal and regulatory requirements, which could have a material effect on our business.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P99_S0	We intend to sell internationally in the future.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P99_S1	In November 2016, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Medikit to sell our Diamondback 360 Coronary and Peripheral OAS in Japan, and in March 2017, we received approval from Japan s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for our Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Movement into international markets will subject us and our products to different and increased laws and regulations, including foreign medical device regulations; tax laws; increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; export laws; and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P100_S1	Although we have and will continue to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, and agents, as well as those companies to which we will outsource certain aspects of our business operations, including those based in foreign countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will comply with our internal policies.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P100_S2	We will incur additional compliance costs associated with global operations, and any alleged or actual violations of these laws and regulations could subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil fines, sanctions and other liabilities, and prohibitions on business conduct, and could negatively affect our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could allow our competitors and others to produce products based on our technology, which could substantially impair our ability to compete.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Our success and ability to compete depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P102_S1	We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P102_S2	Our issued patents and related intellectual property may not be adequate to protect us or permit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P102_S3	Also, we cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P102_S4	Further, if any patents we obtain or license are deemed invalid and unenforceable, or have their scope narrowed, it could impact our ability to commercialize or license our technology and achieve competitive advantages.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P103_S1	In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, if at all.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P104_S0	We may, in the future, need to assert claims of infringement against third parties to protect our intellectual property.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P104_S1	The outcome of litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in patents, copyrights, trade secrets or trademarks is highly unpredictable, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, reputation and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Despite our efforts to safeguard our unpatented and unregistered intellectual property rights, we may not be successful in doing so or the steps taken by us in this regard may not be adequate to detect or deter misappropriation of our technology or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our products, technology or other information that we regard as proprietary.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P105_S1	In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to litigate, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P105_S2	Additionally, third parties may be able to design around our patents.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P106_S0	We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P106_S1	In this regard, we seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by having a policy that our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P106_S2	We cannot provide any assurance that employees and third parties will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements, or that we will be effective in securing necessary assignments from these third parties.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others could prohibit us from commercializing products, require us to obtain licenses from third parties or require us to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages and injunctive relief.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P108_S0	The medical technology industry is characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P108_S1	The likelihood that patent infringement or misappropriation claims may be brought against us increases as we achieve more visibility in the marketplace and introduce products to market.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P109_S0	We are aware of numerous patents issued to third parties that relate to the manufacture and use of medical devices for the treatment of vascular disease.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P110_S0	owners of each of these patents could assert that the manufacture, use or sale of our products infringes one or more claims of their patents.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P110_S1	There could also be existing patents of which we are unaware that one or more aspects of our technology may inadvertently infringe.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P110_S2	In some cases, litigation may be threatened or brought by a patent-holding company or other adverse patent owner who has no relevant product revenues and against whom our patents may provide little or no deterrence.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Any infringement or misappropriation claim could cause us to incur significant costs, place significant strain on our financial resources, divert management s attention from our business and harm our reputation.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P111_S1	If the relevant patents were upheld in litigation as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe, we could be prohibited from commercializing any infringing products unless we could obtain licenses to use the technology covered by the patent or are able to design around the patent.
1180145_17_ITEM1A_P111_S2	We may be unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may not be able to redesign any infringing products to avoid infringement.
1180145_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal executive offices are located in our headquarters, a 125,000 square foot facility in St. Paul, Minnesota, which contains dedicated research and development, training and education, and manufacturing facilities, and our central administrative offices.
1180145_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	In March 2017, we sold the Minnesota facility and entered into an agreement to lease the facility through March 2032.
1180145_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	In September 2009, we entered into an agreement to lease a 46,000 square foot production facility in Pearland, Texas beginning in April 2010 and continuing through March 2020.
1180145_17_ITEM2_P1_S1	This facility primarily accommodates additional manufacturing activities.
1180145_17_ITEM2_P2_S0	We believe that our current facilities are substantially adequate for our current and anticipated future needs for the foreseeable future.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are party to Steven Babyak v. Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. , a lawsuit originally filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, on November 16, 2015.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	The plaintiff was a former Regional Sales Manager in Southern California whose employment terminated on June 1, 2015.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P0_S2	In late 2014 and early 2015, the plaintiff raised concerns and complained about a variety of alleged improper activities and claims his termination was in retaliation for these actions.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P0_S3	We investigated and addressed each of plaintiff s concerns and complaints and deny his assertion.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P1_S0	Following the termination of his employment, the plaintiff made claims under California law relating to whistleblower retaliation; defamation; discrimination on the basis of association with protected group; harassment on the basis of sex in violation of FEHA; retaliation for exercising rights under FEHA; failure to prevent discrimination, harassment retaliation in violation of FEHA; wrongful termination in violation of public policy; and violation of business and professions code.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P1_S1	The plaintiff s complaint did not demand any specific dollar amount, but generally sought compensatory damages, together with prejudgment interest; general damages; reasonable attorney s fees; exemplary and punitive damages; costs of suit; permanent injunction; disgorgement of profits; civil penalties; pre-judgment and post-judgment relief; and such other and further relief as the court deems just and proper.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P2_S0	Prior to trial, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his claim for defamation and dropped his claims for emotional distress damages.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P2_S1	In addition, the plaintiff s claims for discrimination, discrimination on the basis of association with a protected group, failure to prevent discrimination, and violation of business and professions code were dismissed on motion for summary judgment.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P2_S2	Following an April 2017 trial, a jury awarded the plaintiff $2.7 million in compensatory damages with respect to his claims for whistleblower retaliation and wrongful termination in violation of public policy.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P2_S3	The jury also awarded the plaintiff $22.4 million in punitive damages with respect to the same claims.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P2_S4	The jury did not find any liability with respect to the plaintiff s other remaining claims or grant the plaintiff any other relief sought.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P3_S0	We filed post-trial motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial, on the grounds that this case was incorrectly decided as to liability, the compensatory and punitive damages were not appropriate and were excessive, and we were prevented from a fair trial by the improper exclusion of critical evidence.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P3_S1	On June 29, 2017, the Court partially granted our motions, reducing the punitive damages award from $22.4 million to $2.7 million but denied our other motions.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P3_S2	We believe that this case was incorrectly decided as to liability and the appropriateness and amount of any damages, and we filed a Notice of Appeal on July 24, 2017.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P4_S0	On February 12, 2016, a stockholder purporting to represent a class of persons who purchased our securities between September 12, 2011 and January 21, 2016 filed a lawsuit against us and certain of our officers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Paradis v. Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., et al., 2:16-cv-01011 (C.D. Cal.).
1180145_17_ITEM3_P4_S1	The lawsuit alleges that we made materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about our business, operational and financial performance, in violation of federal securities laws, relating to (1) alleged kickbacks to health care providers, (2) alleged off-label promotion of medical devices, and (3) alleged violations of the FDCA and related regulations in connection with our medical devices.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P4_S2	On March 4, 2016, a second stockholder filed a similar lawsuit against us and certain of our officers in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, Shoemaker v. Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P4_S3	et al. , 0:16-cv-00568 (D. Minn.).
1180145_17_ITEM3_P4_S4	The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the alleged class, interest, and attorney s fees and costs of litigation.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P4_S5	On April 12, 2016, four motions for appointment as lead plaintiff were filed in the Paradis action and three of the four proposed plaintiffs also filed a motion for appointment as lead plaintiff in the Shoemaker action.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P4_S6	On April 26, 2016, the Paradis action was voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs in favor of the Shoemaker action.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P4_S7	That same day, the Shoemaker court entered an order appointing the City of Miami Fire Fighters Police Officers Retirement Trust and the County Retirement Systems as Co-Lead Plaintiffs for representing the putative class.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P4_S8	On June 28, 2016, the Co-Lead Plaintiffs filed a new complaint.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P4_S9	We filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in this action on August 29, 2016.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P4_S10	A hearing was held on the motion to dismiss on December 2, 2016.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P4_S11	On March 29, 2017, the court granted our motion to dismiss the complaint and dismissed the plaintiffs amended complaint without prejudice.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P4_S12	The court granted the plaintiffs request for leave to amend their complaint, and on June 27, 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P4_S13	The amended complaint makes similar allegations as the original complaint, namely, that we made materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about our business, operational and financial performance, in violation of federal securities laws, relating to alleged kickbacks to health care providers.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P4_S14	The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the alleged class, interest, and attorney s fees and costs of litigation.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P4_S15	We filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on August 11, 2017.
1180145_17_ITEM3_P4_S16	We believe that this lawsuit is without merit and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously.
1180145_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	We trade on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol CSII.
1180145_17_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for our common stock (based upon intra-day trading) as reported by the Nasdaq Global Market:
1180145_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	The number of record holders of our common stock on August 18, 2017 was approximately 144.
1180145_17_ITEM5_P1_S1	No cash dividends have been previously paid on our common stock and none are anticipated during fiscal year 2018 .
1180145_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	For information on our equity compensation plans, refer to Item 12, Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.
1180145_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return of our common stock ( CSII ) with the return of the Standard Poor s 500 Stock Index ( S P ) and the S P Health Care Index ( S P HC ) from June 30, 2012 through June 30, 2017.
1180145_17_ITEM5_P3_S1	The comparisons assume $100 was invested on June 30, 2012 in our common stock, the S P 500 Stock Index and the S P Health Care Index and also assumes that any dividends are reinvested.
1180145_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	The returns set forth on the following graph are based on historical results and are not intended to suggest future performance.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	You should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our business and operations, based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance, that involve risks and uncertainties.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many important factors, including the factors we describe under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are a medical technology company leading the way in the effort to successfully treat patients suffering from peripheral and coronary artery diseases, including those with arterial calcium, the most difficult arterial disease to treat.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	We are committed to clinical rigor, constant innovation and a defining drive to set the industry standard to deliver safe and effective medical devices that improve lives of patients facing this difficult disease state.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) products, the Diamondback 360 Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy System ( OAS ) ( Diamondback 360 Peripheral ), the Diamondback 360 60cm Peripheral OAS, the Diamondback 360 4 French 1.25 Peripheral OAS, the Diamondback 360 1.50 Peripheral OAS, the Diamondback 360 2.00 Peripheral OAS, and the Stealth 360 Peripheral OAS ( Stealth 360 ), are catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of plaque types in leg arteries both above and below the knee, including calcified plaque, and address many of the limitations associated with existing surgical, catheter and pharmacological treatment alternatives.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	The micro-invasive devices use small access sheaths that can provide procedural benefits and allow physicians to treat PAD patients in even the small and tortuous vessels located below the knee through alternative access sites in the ankle and foot as well as in the groin.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	We refer to each of the products above in this report as the Peripheral OAS.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	The FDA has granted us multiple 510(k) clearances for our Peripheral OAS devices as a therapy in patients with peripheral artery disease.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	See Item 1 in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional detail.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our coronary arterial disease ( CAD ) product, Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS ( Coronary OAS ), is marketed as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	The Coronary OAS is a catheter-based platform designed to facilitate stent delivery in patients with CAD who are acceptable candidates for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or stenting due to de novo, severely calcified coronary artery lesions.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	The Coronary OAS design is similar to technology used in our Peripheral OAS, customized specifically for the coronary application.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	A coronary application required us to conduct a clinical trial and file a premarket approval ( PMA ) application and obtain approval from the FDA.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	In March 2013, we completed submission of our PMA application to the FDA for our orbital atherectomy system to treat calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	In October 2013, we received PMA from the FDA to market the Coronary OAS as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P6_S3	We commenced a commercial launch of our Coronary OAS following receipt of PMA.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P6_S4	In March 2017, the Company received approval from the FDA to market its Diamondback360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown, which is the only atherectomy device designed to both pilot tight, calcific lesions and treat 2.5 to 4mm vessels with a single device.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	We market the Peripheral and Coronary OAS in the U.S. through a direct sales force and expend significant capital on our sales and marketing efforts to expand our customer base and utilization per customer.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	At our facilities, we assemble the saline infusion pump and the single-use catheter used in the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS with components purchased from third-party suppliers, as well as with components manufactured in-house.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	Ancillary products are purchased from third-party suppliers.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	In November 2016, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Medikit Co., Ltd.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	( Medikit ) to sell our Diamondback 360 Coronary and Peripheral OAS in Japan.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	In March 2017, we received approval from Japan s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for our Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P8_S3	Pending reimbursement approval, Japan will be the first international market for any of our products.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P8_S4	We are currently evaluating options for additional international markets to expand the coronary and peripheral opportunities.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	We derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of Peripheral OAS, the Coronary OAS and ancillary products.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	The Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS each use a disposable, single-use, low-profile catheter that travels over our proprietary ViperWire guide wire.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	The systems use a saline infusion pump as a power supply for the operation of the catheter.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	Additional ancillary products include the ViperSlide Lubricant and ViperTrack Radiopaque Tape.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	We assemble the single-use catheter with components purchased from third-party suppliers, as well as with components manufactured in-house.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	The infusion pump and guide wires are purchased from third-party suppliers.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses include compensation for executive, sales, marketing, finance, information technology, human resources and administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	Other significant expenses include the medical device excise tax, bad debt expense, travel, marketing costs, professional fees and professional education.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing, enhancement and regulatory approval of our products.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	Research and development expenses include employee compensation including stock-based compensation, supplies and materials, patent expenses, consulting expenses, travel and facilities overhead.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	We also incur significant expenses to operate clinical trials, including trial design, third-party fees, clinical site reimbursement, data management and travel expenses.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P14_S3	All research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Approved patent applications are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	Other (income) and expense, net primarily includes interest expense from amounts owed under the Facility lease and DOJ settlement, and interest income from money market funds.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	We have established valuation allowances to fully offset our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty about our ability to generate the future taxable income necessary to realize these deferred assets, particularly in light of our historical losses.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	The future use of net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on us attaining profitable operations and will be limited in any one year under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 due to significant ownership changes (as defined in Section 382) resulting from our equity financings.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P17_S2	At June 30, 2017 , we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax reporting purposes of approximately $239.3 million , which will expire at various dates through fiscal 2036.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect amounts reported in those statements.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	Our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, excess and obsolete inventory, and stock-based compensation are updated as appropriate at least quarterly.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P18_S3	We use authoritative pronouncements, our technical accounting knowledge, cumulative business experience, valuation specialists, judgment and other factors in the selection and application of our accounting policies.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P18_S4	While we believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments that we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements are appropriate, these estimates, assumptions and judgments are subject to factors and uncertainties regarding their outcome.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P18_S5	Therefore, actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Some of our significant accounting policies require us to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	We sell the majority of our products via direct shipment to hospitals or clinics.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P20_S2	Revenue recognition may occur upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site, based on the contract terms.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P20_S3	We record estimated sales returns, discounts and rebates as a reduction of net sales.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period the revenue is recognized.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	Cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	This allowance is an estimate and is regularly evaluated for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience, credit quality of the customer base, age of the receivable balances, both individually and in the aggregate, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	Provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts attributed to bad debt are recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P22_S3	During the years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded bad debt expense of $465,000 , $725,000 , and $1.1 million , respectively.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	We have inventories that are principally comprised of capitalized direct labor and manufacturing overhead, raw materials and components, and finished goods.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	Due to the technological nature of our products, there is a risk of obsolescence for changes in our technology and the market, which is impacted by technological developments and events.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	Accordingly, we write down our inventories as we become aware of any situation where the carrying amount exceeds the estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future demands and market conditions.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P23_S3	The evaluation includes analysis of inventory levels, expected product lives, product at risk of expiration, sales levels by product and projections of future sales demand.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P23_S4	During the years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we wrote off $128,000, $140,000, and $797,000 respectively, of inventory.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	We have stock-based compensation plans, which include stock options, nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	We determine the fair value of our option awards using option-pricing models.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	We determine the fair value of nonvested share awards with market conditions using the Monte Carlo simulation.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	Fair value of nonvested share awards that vest based upon performance or time conditions is determined by the closing market price of our stock on the date of grant.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	Stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period for the awards expected to vest.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Management s key assumptions are developed with input from independent third-party valuation advisors.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	During the years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $10.4 million , $13.0 million , and $14.7 million , respectively.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	In accordance with FASB guidance, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements related to legal proceedings when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	If a loss is reasonably possible, but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	During fiscal 2017 we accrued $2.6 million related to current legal proceedings based on the estimate of the range of the loss that we believe is probable of occurring and recorded a receivable of $1.3 million associated with our present assessment of the probable amount of insurance proceeds we would receive related to the claim, based on the accrued amount of loss referenced above.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	We estimate insurance receivables based on an analysis of our policies, including their exclusions, an assessment of the nature of each claim and remaining coverage, information from its insurance carrier, and the probable loss range referenced above.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	We will continue to assess the probable amount of insurance proceeds expected to be received in this matter each reporting period and make adjustments, if necessary, based on additional facts as they arise.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	In fiscal 2016 we recorded $8.0 million in connection with the Settlement Agreement we entered into with the United States of America, acting through the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Western District of North Carolina and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and Travis Thams.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	In connection with the sale of our headquarters (the Facility ) in March 2017, we entered into an agreement to lease the Facility.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	The Lease Agreement has an initial term of fifteen years, with four consecutive renewal options of five years each at our option.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	As the lease terms resulted in a capital lease classification, we accounted for the sale and leaseback of the Facility as a financing transaction where the assets remain on our balance sheet and a financing obligation was recorded for $20.9 million.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P33_S3	As lease payments are made, they will be allocated between interest expense and a reduction of the financing obligation, resulting in a value of the financing obligation that is equivalent to the net book value of the assets at the end of the lease term.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	At the end of the lease (including any renewal option terms), we will remove the assets and financing obligation from its balance sheet.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	The key assumptions used in the lease analysis were related to the Facility s fair value and the interest rate.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Fair value - We used the most recent appraisal of the Facility, performed during the buyers due diligence, as its fair value at the inception of the lease agreement.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	As the present value of minimum lease payments was more than 90% of this fair value, the lease was determined to be a capital lease.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P36_S2	We reviewed all possible values and believe that the appraised value is the most appropriate for use in the lease analysis.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Interest rate - We used our incremental borrowing rate based on a prior proposal for a term loan.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	Management reviewed various factors and determined that the interest rate used in the calculation is reasonable.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands), and, for certain line items, the changes between the specified periods:
1180145_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	Net revenues increased by $26.7 million , or 15.0% , from $178.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 , to $204.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 .
1180145_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	Revenues from our Peripheral OAS increased $13.5 million, or 10.5%, primarily reflecting an 11.5% increase in the number of devices sold.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	Sales of our Coronary OAS increased by approximately $11.2 million, or 31.2%, reflecting 32.2% more devices sold.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	The increase in Peripheral and Coronary OAS sales are primarily due to the expansion of our customer base.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P39_S4	Other product revenue increased $2.0 million, or 14.1%, during the year ended June 30, 2017 , driven by increased sales of our Peripheral and Coronary OAS, which the other products support.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P39_S5	Currently, all of our revenues are in the U.S.; however, we intend to sell internationally in the future.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P39_S6	In November 2016, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Medikit to sell our Diamondback 360 Coronary and Peripheral OAS in Japan, and in March 2017, we received approval from Japan s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for our Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P39_S7	We expect our revenue to increase as we continue to increase the number of physicians using the devices, increase the usage per physician, introduce new and improved products, generate additional clinical data, and expand into new geographies.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Cost of goods sold increased by $4.0 million , or 11.3% , from $35.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 to $39.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 .
1180145_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	These amounts represent the cost of materials, labor and overhead for single-use catheters, guide wires, pumps, and other ancillary products.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	The increase was primarily due to increased sales levels and a one-time charge of $1.5 million related to the initiation of a voluntary recall of one type of our saline infusion pumps, partially offset by lower costs per unit driven by manufacturing efficiencies and cost reductions.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P40_S3	Gross margin increased to 80.8% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 80.1% for the year ended June 30, 2016 due to lower costs per unit, as discussed above.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P40_S4	Cost of goods sold for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 includes $689,000 and $794,000 , respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P40_S5	We expect that gross margin in fiscal 2018 will be comparable to the year ended June 30, 2017.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Quarterly margin fluctuations could occur based on production volumes, timing of new product introductions, sales mix, pricing changes, or other unanticipated circumstances.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses .
1180145_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by $18.4 million , or 11.3% , from $162.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 to $144.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 primarily due to lower payroll-related and travel expenses from a decrease in headcount from the year ended June 30, 2016, commission plan changes, $1.5 million of prior year costs associated with the departure of our former CEO, and a reduction in medical device excise tax expense due to the suspension of the tax effective January 1, 2016.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	Partially offsetting the decreases was a charge of $1.3 million for employment litigation costs and an increase in incentive compensation expense due to performance.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P42_S3	Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 include $8.7 million and $10.4 million , respectively, for stock-based compensation, which decreased due to the reduction in headcount and a change in vesting terms for our performance-based restricted stock awards granted in fiscal 2017 from those granted in fiscal 2016.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P42_S4	We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase as revenue grows in fiscal 2018, but at a rate less than the rate of revenue growth.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Research and development expenses decreased by $3.0 million , or 11.7% , from $25.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 to $22.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 .
1180145_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	Research and development expenses relate to the specific projects to develop new products or expand into new markets, such as the development of new versions of our Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS, and ancillary products, and PAD and CAD clinical studies.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	The decrease primarily related to the completion of enrollment in several of our clinical studies and lower payroll-related expenses from a decrease in headcount from the year ended June 30, 2016.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	Partially offsetting these were higher patent expense and incentive compensation expense due to performance.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P43_S4	Research and development expenses for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 include $1.0 million and $1.8 million , respectively, for stock-based compensation, which decreased due to the reduction in headcount.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P43_S5	We generally expect to incur research and development expenses higher in fiscal 2018 than amounts incurred for the year ended June 30, 2017 due to timing of projects and studies.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P43_S6	Fluctuations could occur based on the number of projects and studies and the timing of expenditures.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	In March 2016, we announced a broad-based restructuring to reduce costs as a key part of our plan to balance revenue growth with a pathway to profitability and positive cash flow.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	As a result, we recorded a restructuring expense of $2.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2016, which was comprised of severance and other employee related costs.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	We do not anticipate additional charges related to restructuring activities.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	On June 28, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the United States of America, acting through the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina (the DOJ ) and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and Travis Thams (the Relator ), to resolve the previously disclosed investigation by the DOJ and the qui tam complaint filed by the Relator pursuant to the False Claims Act in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	We recorded an $8.0 million legal settlement expense during the year ended June 30, 2016.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Net revenues decreased by $3.4 million, or 1.9%, from $181.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015, to $178.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	This decrease was primarily attributable to the expiration in June 2015 of our exclusive distribution agreement with Asahi to market its peripheral guidewire line in the U.S., which contributed approximately $7.5 million in sales during the year ended June 30, 2015.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	Revenues from our Peripheral OAS decreased $6.6 million, or 4.9%, primarily reflecting a 3.4% decrease in the average selling prices, as well as a 1.5% decrease in the number of devices sold, primarily resulting from challenges associated with the expansion of our sales force and the transition to a dual-franchise (peripheral and coronary) sales organization.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P46_S3	Sales of our Coronary OAS increased approximately $9.2 million, or 34.2%, reflecting 35.2% more devices sold from the expansion of our customer base.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P46_S4	Other product revenue decreased $6.0 million, or 29.5%, during the year ended June 30, 2016, driven by the absence of sales of the Asahi guidewires, partially offset by an increase of $1.6 million in other products that support our Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Cost of goods sold decreased by $4.1 million, or 10.4%, from $39.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 to $35.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	These amounts represent the cost of materials, labor and overhead for single-use catheters, guide wires, pumps, and other ancillary products.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	The decrease was primarily due to lower indirect costs per unit sold from higher production volumes and manufacturing efficiencies.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P47_S3	Gross margin increased to 80.1% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 78.2% for the year ended June 30, 2015 due to lower costs per unit, as discussed above.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P47_S4	Cost of goods sold for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 includes $794,000 and $1.0 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $18.9 million, or 13.1%, from $143.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 to $162.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to the expansion of our sales and administrative organizations.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	In addition, we incurred a $1.5 million expense associated with the departure of our former CEO and increased legal fees primarily associated with the DOJ matter discussed below.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	Partially offsetting the increase was a reduction in medical device excise tax expense of $1.5 million due to the suspension of the tax, effective January 1, 2016.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P48_S3	Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 include $10.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation, which decreased due to lower than expected attainment of performance based restricted stock award goals.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	Research and development expenses decreased by $5.0 million, or 16.3%, from $31.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 to $25.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	Research and development expenses relate to the specific projects to develop new products or expand into new markets, such as the development of new versions of our Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS, and ancillary products, and PAD and CAD clinical studies.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	The decrease primarily related to the completion of enrollment in several of our clinical studies.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P49_S3	Research and development expenses for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 include $1.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	In March 2016, we announced a broad-based restructuring to reduce costs as a key part of our plan to balance revenue growth with a pathway to profitability and positive cash flow.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	As a result, we recorded a restructuring expense of $2.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2016, which was comprised of severance and other employee related costs.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	On June 28, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the United States of America, acting through the DOJ and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Relator, to resolve the previously disclosed investigation by the DOJ and the qui tam complaint filed by the Relator pursuant to the False Claims Act in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	We recorded an $8.0 million legal settlement expense during the year ended June 30, 2016.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	To supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, our management uses a non-GAAP financial measure referred to as Adjusted EBITDA.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable United States GAAP measure expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands):
1180145_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	Adjusted EBITDA improved as compared to the prior year due to the lower loss from operations as a result of higher revenues and lower costs, slightly offset by lower stock based compensation as a result of reduced headcount.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of performance and believe this measure facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by factoring out potential differences caused by depreciation and amortization expense and non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA to analyze the underlying trends in our business, assess the performance of our core operations, establish operational goals and forecasts that are used to allocate resources and evaluate our performance period over period and in relation to our competitors operating results.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P54_S2	Additionally, our management is partially evaluated on the basis of Adjusted EBITDA when determining achievement of their incentive compensation performance targets.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P54_S3	Management does not use this Adjusted EBITDA measure as a liquidity measure or in the calculation of our financial covenants under the revolving credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	We believe that presenting Adjusted EBITDA provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	We also believe that providing this information better enables our investors to understand our operating performance and evaluate the methodology used by our management to evaluate and measure such performance.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	The following is an explanation of each of the items that management excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and the reasons for excluding each of these individual items:
1180145_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	Our management believes that excluding this item from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand the application of stock-based compensation guidance and its impact on our operational performance and ability to make additional investments in the Company, and it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	Our management believes that excluding these items from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand our operational performance and ability to make additional investments in the company.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	Some of the limitations associated with our use of these non-GAAP financial measures are:
1180145_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	Items such as stock-based compensation do not directly affect our cash flow position; however, such items reflect economic costs to us and are not reflected in our Adjusted EBITDA, and therefore these non-GAAP measures do not reflect the full economic effect of these items.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore other companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	Our management exercises judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures we use.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily upon our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	We had cash and cash equivalents of $107.9 million and $60.6 million at June 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	During the year ended June 30, 2017 , net cash provided by operations was $19.6 million .
1180145_17_ITEM7_P64_S2	As of June 30, 2017 , we had an accumulated deficit of $329.3 million .
1180145_17_ITEM7_P64_S3	We have historically funded our operating losses primarily from the issuance of common and preferred stock, convertible promissory notes, and debt.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	On December 29, 2016, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement, as subsequently amended (collectively, the Sale Agreement ), with Krishna Holdings, LLC (the Buyer ), providing for the sale to Buyer of our headquarters facility in St. Paul, Minnesota (the Facility ), for a cash purchase price of $21.5 million.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	On March 30, 2017, the sale of the Facility under the Sale Agreement closed.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P65_S2	We received proceeds of approximately $20.9 million ($21.5 million less $556,000 of transaction expenses).
1180145_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not limited to:
1180145_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the potential acquisition of, or investments in, businesses, technologies and products, although we have no current understandings, commitments or arrangements to do so.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion over the use of these net proceeds.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	On March 31, 2017, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement ) with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB ).
1180145_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	The Loan Agreement provides for a senior, secured revolving credit facility (the Revolver ) of $40.0 million (the Maximum Dollar Amount ).
1180145_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	Advances under the Revolver may be made from time to time up to the Maximum Dollar Amount, subject to certain borrowing limitations.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	The Revolver has a maturity date of March 31, 2020 and bears interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the Wall Street Journal prime rate, less 0.25%.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P70_S2	Interest on borrowings is due monthly and the principal balance is due at maturity.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P70_S3	Borrowings up to $10.0 million are available on a non-formula basis.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	Upon the Revolver s maturity, any outstanding principal balance, unpaid accrued interest, and all other obligations under the Revolver will be due and payable.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	We will incur a fee equal to 1% of the Maximum Dollar Amount upon termination of the Loan Agreement or the Revolver for any reason prior to the maturity date, unless refinanced with SVB.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by certain of our assets, including, among other things, accounts receivable, deposit accounts, inventory, equipment, general intangibles and records pertaining to the foregoing.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	The collateral does not include our intellectual property, but we agreed not to encumber our intellectual property without the consent of SVB.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Loan Agreement contains customary covenants limiting our ability to, among other things, incur debt or liens, make certain investments and loans, enter into transactions with affiliates, undergo certain fundamental changes, dispose of assets, or change the nature of its business.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	In addition, the Loan Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain, at all times when any amounts are outstanding under the Revolver, either (i) minimum unrestricted cash at SVB and unused availability on the Revolver of at least $10.0 million or (ii) minimum trailing three-month Adjusted EBITDA of $1.0 million.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P73_S2	If we do not comply with the various covenants under the Loan Agreement, the interest rate on outstanding amounts will increase by 5% and SVB may, subject to various customary cure rights, decline to provide additional advances under the Revolver, require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Revolver, and foreclose on all collateral.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	Under the Loan Agreement, we paid SVB a non-refundable commitment fee of $80,000, which will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the Loan Agreement.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	We are required to pay a fee equal to 0.35% per annum on the unused portion of the Revolver, payable quarterly in arrears.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P74_S2	SVB s obligations to advance funds under the Revolver are subject to an initial collateral examination to be completed within 90 days of the effective date of the Loan Agreement.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P74_S3	We are not obligated to draw any funds under the Revolver and no amounts are outstanding as of June 30, 2017 .
1180145_17_ITEM7_P74_S4	We currently do not have plans of borrowing under the Loan Agreement.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	Cash and cash equivalents was $107.9 million and $60.6 million at June 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P75_S1	The increase was primarily attributable to net cash provided by our financing and operating activities during the year ended June 30, 2017 .
1180145_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $19.6 million , $(23.6) million , and $(22.4) million for the years ended June 30, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	For the years ended June 30, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , we had a net loss of $1.8 million , $56.0 million , and $32.8 million , respectively, and stock based compensation expense of $10.4 million , $13.0 million , and $14.7 million , respectively.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P76_S2	Significant changes in working capital during these periods included:
1180145_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	Cash provided by (used in) inventories was $543,000 , $(3.5) million , and $(1.1) million during the years ended June 30, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	Cash provided by inventory during fiscal 2017 was primarily due to lower inventory levels from better inventory management.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P77_S2	Cash used by inventory during fiscal 2016 and 2015 was due to higher levels of inventory for future sales growth and new product launches, such as the Diamondback 360 Low Profile Peripheral OAS commercial launch in fiscal 2016 and Coronary OAS commercial launch throughout fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, as well as timing of inventory purchases and sales.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	Cash provided by accrued expenses and other liabilities was $725,000 , $10.9 million , and $4.4 million during the years ended June 30, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P78_S1	Cash provided in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the amount and timing of compensation payments.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P78_S2	Cash provided in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the restructuring accrual, benefits related to our former CEO s departure, and the Department of Justice legal settlement expense.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P78_S3	Cash provided in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to higher accruals for the executive deferred compensation plan, higher payroll and vacation liabilities related to increased headcount, clinical study accruals for increased activity, and the general timing and payment of accruals.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	Net cash used in investing activities was $1.8 million , $3.8 million , and $23.0 million for the years ended June 30, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	Cash used in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment and patents.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	During fiscal 2016, cash was used primarily for the purchase of property and equipment and patents, and for the issuance of a convertible note receivable, partially offset by the sale of available-for-sale marketable securities under the deferred compensation plan.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	During fiscal 2015, cash was used primarily for the construction of our new headquarters and the related equipment purchases.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P80_S2	In addition, we purchased available-for-sale marketable securities for the deferred compensation plans.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	Net cash provided by financing activities was $29.5 million , $4.1 million , and $2.6 million during the years ended June 30, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	Cash provided by financing activities during these periods included:
1180145_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	Cash used in financing activities in these periods included payments on long-term debt of $2.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2015 .
1180145_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	Our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including the extent and duration of future operating losses, the level and timing of future sales and expenditures, the results and scope of ongoing research and product development programs, working capital required to support our business operations, the receipt of and time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals, our sales and marketing programs, the continuing acceptance of our products in the marketplace, competing technologies, market and regulatory developments, ongoing facility requirements, potential strategic transactions (including the potential acquisition of, or investments in, businesses, technologies and products), international expansion, and the existence, defense and resolution of legal proceedings.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	As of June 30, 2017, we believe our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and operations for the foreseeable future, including at least the next twelve months, as well as to fund payments related to the DOJ settlement, expenses relating to implementation and compliance with our Corporate Integrity Agreement, payments under our lease agreements, payments related to our restructuring and departure of our former CEO and anticipated costs relating to litigation.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P83_S2	We intend to retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of our business.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P83_S3	We do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	On June 28, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the United States of America, acting through the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Western District of North Carolina and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (the OIG ), and Travis Thams, pursuant to which we will pay $8.0 million as follows: an initial payment of $3.0 million, which we paid on July 1, 2016, with the remaining $5.0 million, which bears interest at 1.8% per annum, payable in 11 equal quarterly installments, beginning January 1, 2017.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	Under the Settlement Agreement, if we make a single payment in excess of $2.0 million, which payment is not covered by an insurance policy, in settlement of any claims before paying the full Settlement Amount, the remaining unpaid balance of the Settlement Amount will become immediately due and payable, with interest accruing on the unpaid principal portion at an interest rate of 1.8% per annum.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P84_S2	Accordingly, with respect to the employment litigation matter described below, in the event that a final, non-appealable judgement requires us to pay an amount more than $2.0 million that is not covered by an insurance policy, the remaining Settlement Amount, plus accrued interest, will be due and payable at the time of such payment.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	In connection with the resolution of this matter, we entered into a five-year corporate integrity agreement (the Corporate Integrity Agreement ) with the OIG.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	Agreement, including establishment of specific procedures and requirements regarding consulting activities, co-marketing activities and other interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare institutions and the sale and marketing of our products; ongoing monitoring, reporting, certification and training obligations; and the engagement of an independent review organization to perform certain auditing and reviews and prepare certain reports regarding our compliance with federal health care programs.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	In the event of a breach of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could become liable for payment of certain stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal health care programs.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P86_S2	The Corporate Integrity Agreement requires us to invest additional amounts in our compliance program and pay fees and expenses of the independent review organization.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	In March 2016, we announced a broad-based restructuring to reduce costs as a part of our plan to progress towards profitability and positive cash flow.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	As a result, we recorded a restructuring expense of $2.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2016, which was comprised of severance and other employee related costs.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P87_S2	As of June 30, 2017, approximately $169,000 is payable over the next twelve months and $22,000 payable in subsequent periods.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P87_S3	See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	In February, 2016, our former CEO resigned from his positions as President and CEO of the Company and as a director of the Company.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	The Company and the former CEO entered into a Separation Agreement with benefits consistent with our Amended and Restated Executive Officer Severance Plan.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P88_S2	As of June 30, 2017, there was approximately $413,000 that will be paid in the next twelve months and $14,000 subsequently payable.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P88_S3	See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	We entered into a Lease Agreement (the Lease Agreement ) with Krishna Holdings, LLC, Apex Holdings, LLC, Kashi Associates, LLC, Keva Holdings, LLC, S V Ventures, LLC, Polo Group LLC, SPAV Holdings LLC, Star Associates LLC, and The Global Villa, LLC.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	The Lease Agreement has an initial term of fifteen years, with four consecutive renewal options of five years each, with a base annual rent in the first year of $1.6 million and annual escalations of 3%.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P89_S2	See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	In April 2017, we initiated a voluntary recall of one type of our saline infusion pumps.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	We plan to recall and replace approximately 900 units that were in customer inventory at the time the recall commenced and recorded a reserve for approximately $1.5 million of expenses during the year ended June 30, 2017 related to the recall and replacement of all affected saline infusion pumps.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P90_S2	As of June 30, 2017, we had 338 pumps remaining to be replaced.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	We are party to Steven Babyak v. Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. , a lawsuit originally filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, on November 16, 2015.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	The plaintiff, a former Regional Sales Manager, made claims under California law relating to whistleblower retaliation; defamation; discrimination on the basis of association with protected group; harassment on the basis of sex in violation of FEHA; retaliation for exercising rights under FEHA; failure to prevent discrimination, harassment retaliation in violation of FEHA; wrongful termination in violation of public policy; and violation of business and professions code.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P91_S2	Following an April 2017 trial, a jury awarded the plaintiff $2.7 million in compensatory damages with respect to his claims for whistleblower retaliation and wrongful termination in violation of public policy.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P91_S3	The jury also awarded the plaintiff $22.4 million in punitive damages with respect to the same claims.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	We filed post-trial motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial, on the grounds that this case was incorrectly decided as to liability, the compensatory and punitive damages were not appropriate and were excessive, and we were prevented from a fair trial by the improper exclusion of critical evidence.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P92_S1	On June 29, 2017, the Court partially granted our motions, reducing the punitive damages award from $22.4 million to $2.7 million but denied our other motions.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P92_S2	We believe that this case was incorrectly decided as to liability and the appropriateness and amount of any damages and we filed a Notice of Appeal on July 24, 2017.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	We have accrued $2.6 million in the year ended June 30, 2017 based on our estimate of the range of possible losses and have recorded a receivable for $1.3 million of insurance proceeds related to the claim, under the guidance of ASC 450 and 210, respectively.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	Our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of June 30, 2017 are summarized below:
1180145_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	(1) The amounts represent future minimum payments under a non-cancellable operating leases for our offices and production facility along with equipment.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	(2) The amounts represent future minimum payments due under the capital lease related to the sale leaseback of our Facility.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P95_S2	(4) Consists of payments and related interest associated with the DOJ Settlement discussed above.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P95_S3	(5) Includes severance related to our former CEO, restructuring activities, and other severance agreements.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at June 30, 2017, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P96_S1	Therefore, $570,000 of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business and operating results during the periods presented.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	Since inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued amended revenue recognition guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P99_S1	The guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods or services.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P99_S2	The guidance also requires expanded disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P99_S3	Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P99_S4	We are working through an adoption plan which will include a review of customer contracts, applying the five-step model of the new standard to the customer contracts and comparing the results to our current accounting.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P99_S5	As part of this, we are evaluating the method of adoption and assessing changes that might be necessary to information technology systems, processes, and internal controls to capture new data and address changes in financial reporting.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P99_S6	Effective July 1, 2018, we will be revising our revenue recognition accounting policy and expanding revenue disclosures to reflect the requirements of the amended revenue recognition guidance.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	Because of the nature of the work that remains, at this time we are unable to reasonably estimate the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P101_S1	The guidance requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope of the ASU at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P101_S2	ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016 and should be applied prospectively.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P101_S3	The guidance is effective on July 1, 2017.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	We do not anticipate a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P103_S1	The guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016 and can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	The guidance is effective on July 1, 2017.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	We do not anticipate a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P106_S1	The guidance requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P106_S2	ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, and should be applied using a modified retrospective approach.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P106_S3	The guidance is effective on July 1, 2019.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P106_S4	We are currently evaluating the timing, method of adoption and impact of the new lease guidance on our financial statements.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Stock Compensation.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P107_S1	The guidance simplifies several aspects related to the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, classification on the statement of cash flows, forfeitures, and statutory withholding requirements.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P108_S1	Early adoption is permitted and transition requirements vary based on the amendments adopted.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P108_S2	The guidance is effective on July 1, 2017.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P108_S3	We are currently evaluating the impact of the stock compensation guidance on our financial statements.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which revises guidance for the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments within its scope.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P109_S1	The new standard introduces an approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments and modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	The new approach to estimating credit losses (referred to as the current expected credit losses model) applies to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P111_S0	ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P111_S1	Early adoption is permitted and should be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P111_S2	The guidance is effective on July 1, 2020.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P112_S0	We do not anticipate a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P113_S0	In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Scope of Modification Accounting which clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as modifications.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P113_S1	The new guidance will reduce diversity in practice and result in fewer changes to the terms of an award being accounted for as modifications.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P113_S2	ASU 2017-09 will be applied prospectively to awards modified on or after the adoption date.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P113_S3	The guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P114_S0	We do not anticipate a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P115_S0	The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements.

1180145_17_ITEM7_P118_S1	Forward-looking statements are only predictions and are not guarantees of performance.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P118_S2	These statements are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on their interpretation of currently available information.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P118_S3	These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our results or our industry s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from the information expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.

1180145_17_ITEM7_P118_S5	These and additional risks and uncertainties are described more fully in Item 1A of this Form 10-K under Risk Factors.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P119_S0	You should read these risk factors and the other cautionary statements made in this Form 10-K as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Form 10-K. We cannot assure you that the forward looking statements in this Form 10-K will prove to be accurate.
1180145_17_ITEM7_P119_S1	Furthermore, if our forward-looking statements prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material.

1180145_17_ITEM7_P119_S3	Other than as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, even though our situation may change in the future.
1180145_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk or availability.
1180145_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	To achieve these objectives, our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of marketable securities, including money market funds, United States government securities, and certain bank obligations.
1180145_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2017 include liquid money market accounts.
1180145_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk.
1180145_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Additionally, we have certain available-for-sale marketable securities under our deferred compensation plan.
1180145_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on these available-for-sale marketable securities.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive loss, of changes in stockholders equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1180145_17_ITEM8_P1_S2	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting under Item 9A.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P1_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1180145_17_ITEM8_P1_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P1_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P1_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P1_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1180145_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (the Company ) was incorporated as Replidyne, Inc. ( Replidyne ) in Delaware in 2000 .
1180145_17_ITEM8_P9_S1	On February 25, 2009, Replidyne completed its business combination with Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., a Minnesota corporation, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of November 3, 2008.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P9_S2	At the effective time of the merger, Replidyne changed its name to Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	The Company develops, manufactures and markets devices for the treatment of vascular diseases.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P10_S1	The Company s peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) products, the Diamondback 360 Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy System ( OAS ) and the Stealth 360 Peripheral OAS, are catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of plaque types, including calcified plaque, in leg arteries both above and below the knee, and address many of the limitations associated with other surgical, catheter and pharmacological treatment alternatives.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P10_S2	These devices use smaller access sheaths that can provide procedural benefits and allow physicians to treat PAD patients in a variety of vessel sizes, including the small and tortuous vessels located below the knee through alternative access sites in the ankle and foot as well as in the groin.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	In October 2013, the Company received premarket approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to market the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P11_S1	In March 2017, the Company received approval from the FDA to market the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P11_S2	The Coronary OAS Micro Crown is the only atherectomy device designed to treat both pilot tight, calcific lesions and treat 2.5 to 4mm vessels with a single device.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company is currently selling only in the United States.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P12_S1	In November 2016, the Company signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Medikit Co., Ltd.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P12_S2	( Medikit ) to sell its Diamondback 360 Coronary and Peripheral OAS in Japan.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P12_S3	In March 2017, the Company received approval from Japan s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for its Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P12_S4	Pending reimbursement approval, Japan would become the first international market for any of the Company s products.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P12_S5	The Company is currently evaluating options for additional international markets to expand the coronary and peripheral opportunities.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	The consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, after elimination of all intercompany transactions and accounts.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Company considers all money market funds and other investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P15_S1	Customer credit terms are established prior to shipment with the general standard being net 30 days.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P15_S2	Collateral or any other security to support payment of these receivables generally is not required.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P15_S3	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is an estimate regularly evaluated by the Company for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience, credit quality of the customer base, age of the receivable balances, both individually and in the aggregate, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P15_S4	Provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts attributed to bad debt are recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	The following table shows the allowance for doubtful accounts activity:
1180145_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first-in, first-out method of valuation.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	The establishment of inventory allowances for excess and obsolete inventories is based on estimated exposure on specific inventory items.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	We write down our inventories as we become aware of any situation where the carrying amount exceeds the estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future demands and market conditions.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	Property and equipment is carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P19_S1	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 40 years for the building; five to seven years for production equipment and furniture and fixtures; three years for computer equipment and software; and the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term for leasehold improvements.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P19_S2	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs and minor renewals and betterments that do not extend or improve the life of the respective assets are expensed as incurred.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P19_S3	All other expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P19_S4	The assets and related depreciation accounts are adjusted for property retirements and disposals with the resulting gains or losses included in the consolidated statement of operations.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	The capitalized costs incurred to obtain patents are amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	The recoverability of capitalized patent costs is dependent upon the Company s ability to derive revenue-producing products from such patents or the ultimate sale or licensing of such patent rights.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	Patent recoverability is regularly reviewed and any patents that are abandoned are written off at the time of abandonment.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Company regularly evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or that the remaining estimated useful life should be changed.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated by the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	The Company leases its Texas manufacturing facilities under an operating lease agreement.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	The lease contains rent escalation clauses for which the lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P24_S2	Rent expense that is recognized but not yet paid is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	In March 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to lease the Minnesota facility.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	The Lease Agreement has an initial term of fifteen years, with four consecutive renewal options of five years each at the Company's option.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P25_S2	As the lease terms resulted in a capital lease classification, the Company accounted for the sale and leaseback of the Minnesota facility as a financing transaction where the assets remain on the Company's balance sheet and a financing obligation was recorded for $20,944.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P25_S3	As lease payments are made, they will be allocated between interest expense and a reduction of the financing obligation, resulting in a value of the financing obligation that is equivalent to the net book value of the assets at the end of the lease term.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P25_S4	At the end of the lease (including any renewal option terms), the Company will remove the assets and financing obligation from its balance sheet.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company sells the majority of its products via direct shipment to hospitals or clinics.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P26_S1	The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P26_S2	Revenue recognition may occur upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site, based on the contract terms.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P26_S3	The Company records estimated sales returns, discounts and rebates as a reduction of net sales.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	Costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period the revenue is recognized.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P27_S1	Cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Company provides its customers with the right to receive a replacement if a product is determined to be defective at the time of shipment.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P28_S1	Warranty reserve provisions are estimated based on Company experience, volume, and expected warranty claims.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P28_S2	Warranty reserve, provisions and claims were as follows:
1180145_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	In April 2017, the Company initiated a voluntary recall of one type of its saline infusion pumps.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	The Company is in the process of recalling and replacing approximately 900 units in customer inventory and recorded a reserve for approximately $1,535 of expenses during the year ended June 30, 2017, that included $1,378 of estimated costs related to the recall and replacement of all affected saline infusion pumps, accrued consulting fees, as well as an inventory reserve for pumps held in its inventory.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Company and its operations from time to time are, and in the future may be, parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P30_S2	When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues an amount based on management s best estimate considering all facts and circumstances.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 imposed a medical device excise tax on medical device manufacturers on their sales in the U.S. of certain devices, which was effective January 1, 2013.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	The excise tax is 2.3% of the taxable base and applies to a substantial majority of the Company s sales.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P32_S2	Effective January 1, 2016, the excise tax was suspended until the end of 2017.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P32_S3	For the years ended June 30, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the Company incurred $0 , $1,273 , and $2,731 of expense, respectively.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	Developing a provision for income taxes, including the effective tax rate and the analysis of potential tax exposure items, if any, requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws, regulations and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	The Company s judgment and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	Accounting guidance requires that accounting for uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in the financial statements.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P35_S1	The guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P35_S2	Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P35_S3	The guidance also provides rules on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing, enhancement and regulatory approval of the Company s products.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	Research and development expenses include employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), supplies and materials, consulting expenses, patent amortization, travel and facilities overhead.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P36_S2	The Company also incurs significant expenses to operate clinical trials, including trial design, third-party fees, clinical site reimbursement, data management and travel expenses.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P36_S3	Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P36_S4	Expenses associated with patent applications are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P36_S5	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years .
1180145_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company maintains its cash balances primarily with one financial institution.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P38_S1	These balances exceed federally insured limits.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P38_S2	The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in cash and cash equivalents.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company believes that the credit risk related to marketable securities is limited due to the adherence to an investment policy and that credit risk related to accounts receivable is limited due to a large customer base.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company s marketable securities consist solely of available-for-sale securities and were valued in accordance with the fair value measurement guidance discussed below.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P40_S1	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P40_S2	Realized gains and losses, if any, are calculated on the specific identification method and are included in interest and other, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	Available-for-sale securities are reviewed for possible impairment at least quarterly, or more frequently if circumstances arise that may indicate impairment.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P41_S1	When the fair value of the securities declines below the amortized cost basis, impairment is indicated and it must be determined whether it is other than temporary.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P41_S2	Impairment is considered to be other than temporary if the Company: (i) intends to sell the security, (ii) will more likely than not be forced to sell the security before recovering its cost, or (iii) does not expect to recover the security s amortized cost basis.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P41_S3	If the decline in fair value is considered other than temporary, the cost basis of the security is adjusted to its fair market value and the realized loss is reported in earnings.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P41_S4	Subsequent increases or decreases in fair value are reported in equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
1180145_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	Under the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	The authoritative guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P43_S1	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	The categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	The hierarchy is broken down into three levels defined as follows:

1180145_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	The new approach to estimating credit losses (referred to as the current expected credit losses model) applies to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.

1180145_17_ITEM8_P118_S0	The components of the Company s overall deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1180145_17_ITEM8_P119_S0	The Company has established valuation allowances to fully offset its deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty about the Company s ability to generate the future taxable income necessary to realize these deferred assets, particularly in light of the Company s historical losses.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P119_S1	The future use of net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on the Company attaining profitable operations, and may be limited in any one year under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 due to significant ownership changes, as defined under such Section, as a result of the Company s equity financings.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P120_S0	A summary of the valuation allowances are as follows:
1180145_17_ITEM8_P121_S0	As of June 30, 2017 and 2016 , the Company had federal tax NOL carryforwards of approximately $239,308 and $244,214 , respectively.

1180145_17_ITEM8_P121_S3	These state NOL carryforwards typically have the same expirations as the Company s federal tax NOL carryforwards.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P122_S0	Our federal net operating losses at June 30, 2017 do not include $42,097 of income tax deductions in excess of previously recorded tax benefits related to stock compensation.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P122_S1	These additional tax deductions are not included in the net operating losses referenced above since the related tax benefit will not be recognized until the deductions reduce our income tax payable.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P122_S2	The tax benefit of these excess deductions will be reflected as a credit to additional paid in capital when recognized.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P122_S3	Accordingly, our deferred tax assets are reported net of the excess tax deductions for stock compensation.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P123_S0	As of June 30, 2017 and 2016 , the Company had approximately $4,137 and $4,078 of federal research and development credit carryforwards, respectively.

1180145_17_ITEM8_P124_S0	As required by FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, the Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P125_S0	The Company recorded a liability relating to unrecognized tax benefits of $570 and $545 at June 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P125_S1	Due to the Company having a full valuation allowance, this liability has been netted against the deferred tax asset.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P125_S2	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax provisions as part of the provision for income taxes.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P125_S3	The Company has not currently reserved for any interest or penalties for such reserves due to the Company being in an NOL position.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P125_S4	The Company does not expect to recognize any benefits from the unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P125_S5	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):

1180145_17_ITEM8_P127_S2	The decrease in rent expense in fiscal 2017 and 2016 relates to the completion of construction of the Company s headquarters, which replaced space previously leased by the Company.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P127_S3	In March 2017, the Company sold the headquarters facility and began leasing that facility.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P128_S0	Future minimum lease payments under the agreements as of June 30, 2017 are as follows:

1180145_17_ITEM8_P130_S0	prevented from a fair trial by the improper exclusion of critical evidence.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P130_S1	On June 29, 2017, the Court partially granted the Company s motions, reducing the punitive damages award from $22,400 to $2,700 but denied the Company s other motions.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P130_S2	The Company believes that this case was incorrectly decided as to liability and the appropriateness and amount of any damages and the Company filed a Notice of Appeal on July 24, 2017.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P131_S0	The Company has accrued $2,600 as of June 30, 2017 based on the estimate of the range of the loss that the Company believes is probable of occurring.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P131_S1	However, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate loss, if the Company is not able to successfully challenge the verdict, could be materially different than the amount that the Company has recorded.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P131_S2	The Company will continue to monitor the accrual associated with this matter each reporting period and make adjustments, if necessary, based on additional facts as they arise.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P131_S3	The amounts are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company s consolidated statement of operations.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P131_S4	Additionally, as of June 30, 2017 , the Company has recorded a receivable of $1,300 associated with its present assessment of the probable amount of insurance proceeds the Company would receive related to the claim, based on the accrued amount of loss referenced above.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P131_S5	The Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of its policies, including their exclusions, an assessment of the nature of each claim and remaining coverage, information from its insurance carrier, and the probable loss range referenced above.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P131_S6	The Company then records an amount it has concluded is probable.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P131_S7	Similar to the accrual pertaining to this matter, the Company will continue to assess the probable amount of insurance proceeds expected to be received in this case each reporting period and make adjustments, if necessary, based on additional facts as they arise.

1180145_17_ITEM8_P133_S1	The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the alleged class, interest, and attorney s fees and costs of litigation.

1180145_17_ITEM8_P135_S6	The court granted the plaintiffs request for leave to amend their complaint, and on June 27, 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P135_S7	The complaint makes similar allegations as the original complaint, namely, that the Company made materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about its business, operational and financial performance, in violation of federal securities laws, relating to alleged kickbacks to health care providers.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P135_S8	The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the alleged class, interest, and attorney s fees and costs of litigation.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P135_S9	The Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on August 11, 2017.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P135_S10	The Company believes that this lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P136_S0	In the ordinary conduct of business, the Company is subject to various lawsuits and claims covering a wide range of matters including, but not limited to, employment claims and commercial disputes.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P136_S1	While the outcome of these matters is uncertain, the Company does not believe there are any other significant matters as of June 30, 2017 that are probable or estimable, for which the outcome is reasonably possible of having a material adverse impact on its consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations.

1180145_17_ITEM8_P139_S0	The following table presents a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used in the basic and diluted earnings per common share computations (in thousands except share and per share amounts):
1180145_17_ITEM8_P140_S0	(3) At June 30, 2017 , 318,584 performance-based restricted stock awards were outstanding.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P140_S1	The effect of the shares that would be issued upon vesting of these awards has been excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share because those shares are anti-dilutive.
1180145_17_ITEM8_P141_S0	The following table sets forth the Company s unaudited quarterly summary consolidated statements of operations in each of the quarters for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 .

1180145_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	We are a medical technology company leading the way in the effort to successfully treat patients suffering from peripheral and coronary artery diseases, including those with arterial calcium, the most difficult form of arterial disease to treat.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	We are committed to clinical rigor, constant innovation and a defining drive to set the industry standard to deliver safe and effective medical devices that improve the lives of patients facing this difficult disease state.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	We have developed a patented orbital atherectomy systems ( OAS ) for both peripheral and coronary commercial applications.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	The primary base of our business is catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of vessel sizes and plaque types, including calcified plaque, and address many of the limitations associated with other treatment alternatives.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	To date, over 392,000 of our OAS devices have been sold to leading institutions across the United States and Japan.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) products are catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of plaque types in leg arteries both above and below the knee, including calcified plaque, and address many of the limitations associated with other existing surgical, catheter and pharmacological treatment alternatives.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	The micro-invasive devices use small access sheaths that can provide procedural benefits and allow physicians to treat PAD patients in even the small and tortuous vessels located below the knee and facilitate access through alternative sites in the ankle, foot and wrist, as well as in the groin.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	The United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) granted 510(k) clearance for the following PAD products as a therapy in patients with PAD.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	We refer to these products in this Form 10-K as the Peripheral OAS.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	Sales of Peripheral OAS during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 represented 68% of revenue.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	In January 2018, we announced that we entered into an original equipment manufacturer agreement with Integer Holdings Corporation to manufacture our ZILIENT guidewires.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	The full U.S. market launch of the ZILIENT peripheral guidewires began in early fiscal 2019.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P10_S2	We anticipate that additional ZILIENT guidewires for coronary interventions and radial peripheral interventions will become available in the future.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	In February 2018, we announced that the first patients were treated using our FDA-cleared extended length Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS to treat PAD.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	The extended length makes it easier for physicians to reach and treat lower limb PAD lesions through the radial artery in the wrist, providing an alternative access point and more options to treat complicated and at-risk patients.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P11_S2	We are currently in a limited market release with an anticipated full commercial launch in fiscal 2019.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	Our coronary arterial disease ( CAD ) product, the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS ( Coronary OAS ), is a catheter-based platform designed to facilitate stent delivery in patients with CAD who are acceptable candidates for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or stenting due to de novo , severely calcified coronary artery lesions.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	The Coronary OAS design is similar to technology used in our Peripheral OAS, customized specifically for the coronary application.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	In October 2013, we received premarket approval ( PMA ) from the FDA to market the Coronary OAS as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries and we commenced a commercial launch that same month.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	Sales of Coronary OAS during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 represented approximately 23% of revenue.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	In January 2018, we announced our relationship with OrbusNeich to be the exclusive U.S. distributor of OrbusNeich balloon products.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	In March 2018, the FDA granted 510(k) clearance for the OrbusNeich 1.0mm Sapphire II Pro coronary balloon ( 1.0mm balloon ).
1180145_18_ITEM1_P14_S2	The 1.0mm balloon, the first and only 1.0mm coronary balloon available in the United States, offers industry-leading entry and crossing profiles and is precision engineered for crossing and treating extremely tight and complex lesions.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P14_S3	We anticipate OrbusNeich s full coronary balloon product portfolio will become available in the United States during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	In addition to the Peripheral and Coronary OAS, we offer multiple accessory products required for use with the Peripheral and Coronary OAS.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	Sales of accessory products, primarily guide wires, represented 9% of revenue during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 .
1180145_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	In November 2016, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Medikit Co., Ltd. to sell our Coronary and Peripheral OAS in Japan.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	In March 2017, we received approval from Japan s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare ( MHLW ) for our Coronary OAS Micro Crown.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P16_S2	In February 2018, the Coronary OAS Micro Crown received reimbursement approval in Japan, followed by the first commercial sales in Japan.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	importantly, an opportunity to provide physicians in Japan a cost-effective treatment option for the difficult-to-treat patient population with severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	In October 2014, we received CE Mark for our Stealth 360 device.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	In July 2018, we entered into an exclusive Distribution Agreement with OrbusNeich to sell our Peripheral and Coronary OAS outside of the United States and Japan.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P18_S2	We expect that OrbusNeich will commence sales of our products in certain countries in Southeast Asia, Europe and the Middle East during fiscal year 2019.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	Peripheral artery disease is widespread and can be life threatening.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	The disease is characterized by narrowed, hardened arteries in the legs, limiting blood flow to the legs and feet.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	If left untreated, PAD may continue to progress to Critical Limb Ischemia ( CLI ), a condition in which the amount of oxygenated blood being delivered to the limb is insufficient to keep the tissue viable.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	CLI may lead to non-healing ulcers, infections, gangrene, limb amputation or death.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	According to estimates by the American Heart Association ( AHA ), as many as 18 million Americans, mostly over the age of 65, have PAD.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	An aging population, coupled with high rates of diabetes and obesity, is likely to continue to increase the prevalence of PAD.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	In many older PAD patients, particularly those with diabetes, PAD is characterized by fibrotic (moderately hard) or calcified (extremely hard) plaque deposits that can be very challenging to treat.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	Although we believe the rate of PAD diagnoses is increasing, we also believe that under-diagnosis continues, due to patient and physician awareness.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	Emphasis on PAD education from industry, medical associations, insurance companies and other groups, coupled with publications in medical journals and public news channels, is increasing physician and patient awareness of PAD risk factors, symptoms, and treatment options.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	Physicians manage a significant portion of the PAD diagnosed population by recommending lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, and by prescribing prescription drugs, such as statins.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	While medications, diet and exercise may improve blood flow, they do not treat the underlying vascular occlusions, and many patients have difficulty maintaining lifestyle changes.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P25_S2	As a result of these challenges, many medically managed patients develop more severe symptoms that require procedural intervention.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	Heart disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease in the United States and is a life-threatening condition.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	CAD occurs when a fatty material called plaque builds up on the walls of arteries that supply blood to the heart.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	The plaque buildup causes the arteries to harden and narrow (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	The risk of CAD increases if a person has one or more of the following: high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, or family history of early heart disease.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	According to the AHA, 16.3 million people in the United States (or 6.3% of the adult population) have CAD, the most common form of heart disease.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 370,000 lives are claimed in the United States each year from CAD.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	According to estimates, significant arterial calcium is present in nearly 40% of patients (Genereux et al., 2014; Bourantas et al., 2014), and severe calcium affects up to 20% of patients (Bourantas et al., 2014), undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ).
1180145_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	Significant calcium contributes to poor outcomes and higher treatment costs in coronary interventions when traditional therapies are used, including a significantly higher occurrence of death and major adverse cardiac events.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our orbital atherectomy systems represent a unique and innovative approach to the treatment of PAD and CAD that provide physicians and patients with a procedure that addresses many of the limitations of other treatment alternatives.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	The Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS devices are single-use catheters that incorporate a control handle and flexible drive shaft with an eccentrically mounted diamond-coated crown.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	The peripheral device is often used for vessel preparation to enable low pressure percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, including the use of drug-coated balloons ( DCB ), and results in lower use of bailout stents.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P33_S2	The coronary device is similarly used to prepare a vessel by treating severe calcium prior to stent delivery to help facilitate vessel access and stent expansion and prevent malapposition of stent struts for optimal stent performance.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	The OAS treats atherosclerotic plaque, which is harder than a normal vessel wall.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	The OAS is designed to differentiate between hard, diseased plaque and healthy, compliant arterial tissue, a concept that we refer to as differential sanding.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P34_S2	The diamond-coated crown preferentially engages and sands away harder material, but is designed not to damage more compliant parts of the artery, which flex away from the crown.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	Physicians position the crown at the site of a lesion containing arterial plaque and orbit the crown against it to sand away the superficial, or surface, plaque and create a smooth lumen, or channel, in the vessel.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	In addition, the crown s rotating eccentric mass and orbital motion deliver pulsatile mechanical energy into the vessel wall.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	pulsatile forces may break up deeper plaque and contribute to improving the compliance change of the diseased segment of the artery.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our OAS uses a single-use, low-profile catheter that travels over our proprietary ViperWire guide wires and is electrically powered by a small, portable saline infusion pump that also helps cool the system and remove debris.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	The Peripheral OAS reduces plaque on peripheral vessel walls by using an orbiting, diamond-coated crown within peripheral arteries.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	Similarly, the Coronary OAS uses the same method to reduce severely calcified plaque on coronary vessel walls within coronary arteries in order to facilitate stent performance.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	The catheter for our OAS consists of:
1180145_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	a sheath, which covers the drive shaft and permits delivery of saline or medications to the treatment area.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	ViperWire Advance Peripheral Guide Wire, ViperWire Advance Peripheral Guide Wire with Flex Tip and ViperWire Advance Coronary Guide Wire.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	The ViperWire guide wires are required for using the OAS and were designed to offer the ability to maneuver through tortuous, twisting blood vessels and cross challenging lesions.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P41_S2	The OAS travels over this wire to the lesion and operates on this wire.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	ViperSlide is an exclusive lubricant designed to optimize the smooth operation of the OAS.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	The saline infusion pump is a small, portable device that bathes the OAS shaft and crown and provides an electric power supply for the operation of the catheter.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	The constant flow of saline during orbit reduces the risk of heat generation and improves the flush of particulates.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	The mechanism of action is a function of the centrifugal force generated by the eccentrically mounted crown as it rotates and orbits inside the vessel.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	As the speed of the crown s rotation increases, centrifugal force increases the crown s radius of orbit and presses the diamond-coated crown against the lesion or plaque, removing a small amount of plaque with each orbit.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P44_S2	The centrifugal force exerted onto the vessel wall decreases as the orbital radius increases, reducing the likelihood of adverse events during treatment.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	The characteristics of the orbit and the resulting lumen size can be adjusted by modifying the following two variables:
1180145_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	An increase in speed creates a larger orbital radius, thus accommodating larger diameter vessels.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our Peripheral OAS allows the user to choose between three rotational speeds.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	Our Coronary OAS Classic Crown allows the user to choose between two rotational speeds, in addition to engaging a recently added Glide Assist feature, which is an innovative solution that facilitates device tracking, provides easier device repositioning, and provides enhanced performance in challenging anatomies.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	The crowns for the OAS are designed with various weights (as determined by crown geometry and material density) and are coated with diamond particles.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	The Peripheral OAS crowns are available in three configurations: classic, micro and solid.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P48_S2	Physicians select crown sizes and configurations based on several case criteria, including reference vessel size, lesion length and degree of stenosis, stenosis morphology, and anatomy tortuosity.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	The crown for the Coronary OAS is available in two configurations: 1.25 millimeter Classic Crown (currently sold in the United States), and the 1.25 millimeter Micro Crown (currently sold in Japan).
1180145_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	Centrifugal force propels the crown outward against the arterial wall as the crown rotates.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	This force is offset by the counterforce exerted by the arterial wall and the guidewire.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	Normal arteries are compliant and have the ability to expand and contract as needed to supply blood flow.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	If the tissue is compliant, it flexes away, minimizing the engagement of the diamond-grit and protecting the integrity of the healthy tissue.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P51_S2	Diseased tissue is less flexible or non-compliant and provides resistance to the centrifugal force, which generates an opposing force that enables the diamond-coated crown to engage and sand the plaque.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P51_S3	The sanded plaque and calcium are broken down into particles generally smaller than circulating red blood cells that are washed away downstream with the patient s natural blood flow.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	The small particle size and short treatment time minimizes the risk of vascular bed overload, or a saturation of the peripheral or coronary vessels with large particles, which may cause slow or reduced blood flow.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	The small size of the particles allows them to be naturally cleared from the blood via various types of white blood cells and macrophages.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	We believe the OAS offers the following key benefits:
1180145_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	Differential Sanding Reduces Risk of Adverse Events .
1180145_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	The OAS is designed to differentiate between hard, non-compliant plaque and soft, compliant arterial tissue.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	Arteries are composed of three tissue layers (from inside to out): the intima, media, and adventitia.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P56_S1	The eccentrically mounted diamond-coated crown at the working end of the device engages and removes plaque from the artery wall with minimal likelihood of penetrating or damaging the fragile intima, or inner layer of the arterial wall because soft, compliant tissue flexes away from the crown.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	The small size of the particles produced during sanding avoids the need for ancillary distal protection devices, commonly used with directional cutting atherectomy devices.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	The small particulate size also significantly reduces the risk of macroembolization, or larger pieces of removed plaque capable of blocking blood flow downstream.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	Allows Continuous Blood Flow During Procedure.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	The OAS allows for continuous blood flow while orbiting, as well as constant flushing of particulates during treatment.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P58_S2	Other devices may restrict blood flow due to the size of the catheter required or the use of distal protection devices, which could result in complications such as excessive heat and tissue damage.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	The Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS portfolio is uniquely compatible with 4 French ( Fr ) to 6Fr sheaths.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	Centrifugal force enables the OAS to treat large vessels through small sheaths; for example, it can treat up to 5mm vessel through a 4Fr sheath.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P59_S2	Smaller sheaths may be associated with fewer bleeding complications, shortened post-procedure ambulation time and reduced radiation exposure.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	Efficacy Demonstrated for Both Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	Peripheral OAS - Our pivotal OASIS clinical trial was designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the OAS in treating patients with symptomatic PAD.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P61_S1	Performance targets were established cooperatively with the FDA before the trial began.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P61_S2	Despite 55% of the lesions consisting of calcified plaque, the Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS successfully met the study endpoints.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	Coronary OAS - Our pivotal ORBIT II Coronary OAS trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the OAS in treating de novo severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P62_S1	The trial met both the primary safety and efficacy endpoints by significant margins.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P62_S2	Preparation of severely calcified plaque with the Coronary OAS not only helped facilitate stent delivery, but also improved both peri-procedural and 30-day clinical outcomes compared with the outcomes of historic control subjects in this difficult-to-treat patient population.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	Treats Difficult, Fibrotic and Calcified Lesions.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	The Peripheral OAS enables physicians to remove plaque from long, fibrotic, or calcified lesions, as well as bifurcated lesions or lesions with softer plaque, in peripheral arteries both above and below the knee.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	In the coronary arteries, the Coronary OAS enables physicians to treat complex, severely calcified lesions, enabling stent placement in these difficult to treat lesions.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P64_S2	To date, the Coronary OAS is the only FDA-approved device approved specifically for treatment of severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	The orbiting action of the OAS removes the hard plaque in the artery by sanding, while the centrifugal motion of the eccentrically mounted crown creates pulsatile forces.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P65_S1	Compliance change is achieved as the OAS differentiates between hard, diseased plaque and healthy, compliant arterial tissue, a concept that we refer to as differential sanding.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P65_S2	The diamond-coated crown preferentially engages and sands away harder material, but is designed to not damage more compliant healthy parts of the artery, which flex away from the crown.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	Physicians position the crown at the site of a lesion containing arterial plaque and orbit the crown against it to sand away the superficial, or surface, plaque and create a smooth lumen, or channel, in the vessel.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P66_S1	In addition, the crown s rotating eccentric mass and orbital motion deliver pulsatile mechanical energy into the vessel wall.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P66_S2	These pulsatile forces may break up deeper plaque and contribute to compliance change of the diseased segment of the artery.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	Together, these mechanistic components sufficiently remove or modify hard plaque, allowing for low pressure balloon inflation.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P67_S1	The orbital motion and speed of the eccentrically mounted crown increases, thus allowing for continuous reduction of plaque with differential sanding and pulsatile forces, as the opening of the lumen increases during the operation of the devices.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	The differential sanding of the OAS creates a smooth lumen surface, or channel, inside the vessel.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P68_S1	We believe that the smooth lumens created by the device increase the velocity of blood flow and decrease the resistance to blood flow, which may decrease the potential for restenosis, or re-narrowing of the arteries.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	Given the relative simplicity of the OAS, physicians and lab staff can usually set up and begin using the device in under two minutes.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	Physicians using the OAS employ techniques similar to those used in angioplasty, which are familiar to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists who are trained in endovascular techniques.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P70_S1	The devices simple user interfaces require minimal additional training.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	Single Crown Treats Multiple Lesions in Various Sized Vessels.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P71_S1	Centrifugal force unique to the OAS allows for a single access site to treat multiple lesions, in most cases.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P71_S2	In the coronary arteries, Coronary OAS is the only atherectomy device able to treat 2.5 to 4mm vessels with one device through a 6Fr radial approach.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P71_S3	In the peripheral vasculature, the OAS is capable of treating multiple lesions in multiple arteries through a single access site, thus reducing the need for multiple devices or the need for multiple access sites.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	Because the particles of plaque sanded away are of such small sizes, the OAS does not require a collection reservoir that needs to be repeatedly emptied or cleaned during the procedure, which would potentially add time and cost to the procedure.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	The unique OAS mechanism of action used in both the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS can be used to treat multiple anatomic locations.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	Below-the-Knee and Behind-the-Knee Peripheral Artery Disease.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	Arteries below and behind the knee are small in diameter and may be diffusely stenosed, calcified or both.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P75_S1	Reaching and treating these small vessels requires a low profile, which most competitive devices do not offer.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P76_S0	Behind-the-knee, or popliteal, lesions also present challenges if a stent is used because stents frequently fracture in this area due to the forces exerted on the vessels when the knee bends or flexes.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P76_S1	The Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS is effective in treating those vessels.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P76_S2	The Peripheral OAS offers a shorter shaft length (60cm), a smaller profile and a more flexible shaft than the predecessors for improved ease of use, and includes a 4-Fr catheter that enables physicians to access lesions below-the-knee using retrograde access through arteries in the ankle or foot.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P77_S0	Arteries above the knee are typically longer, straighter and wider than below-the-knee vessels.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P77_S1	Plaque in these arteries may also be diffuse, fibrotic and calcific.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	Physicians often use higher speeds or larger crown sizes of our products to treat lesions above the knee.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P79_S0	Our newest Peripheral OAS innovation includes the addition of extended length OAS that can treat above-the-knee disease through trans-radial access (access through the radial artery in the wrist).
1180145_18_ITEM1_P79_S1	The ability to treat the larger above-the-knee arteries with OAS via the small trans-radial access sites is made possible by the unique features of the OAS including its small crossing profile and ability to orbit at higher speeds for treatment of larger vessels.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P80_S0	The individuals more at risk for being diagnosed with CAD are those that are suffering from high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, renal insufficiency, or have a family history of heart disease.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P81_S0	The pathogenesis of CAD is marked by the accumulation of a fatty material called plaque on the walls of arteries that supply blood to the heart.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P81_S1	The plaque buildup causes the arteries to harden and narrow (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	The Coronary OAS is the only atherectomy device specifically indicated for severe coronary calcium.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P83_S0	The OAS has a short treatment time, typically less than two minutes.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P84_S0	Single Crown Can Treat Various Lumen Sizes Helping Limit Hospital Costs.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P85_S0	The OAS orbital mechanism of action allows one device to treat various diameter lumens inside the artery.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P85_S1	Adjusting the rotational speed of the crown changes the orbit to create the desired lumen diameter, thereby potentially avoiding the need to use multiple catheters of different sizes to treat multiple lesions.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P86_S0	The low profile of the OAS allows for trans-radial access with benefits to both physicians and patients.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P86_S1	Radial access can enable treatment of complex, calcified coronary and, often, peripheral arteries that are challenging to access.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P86_S2	In addition, the radial access site is associated with lower vascular and bleeding complication rates, faster patient recovery time, and the ability to treat bilateral disease in one setting, address obese patients and work around previous, compromised access sites.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P86_S3	For patients, this contributes to comfort during- and post-operation, earlier ambulation, reduced risk of infection, and faster healing.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P87_S0	Many of the patients treated with the Peripheral OAS have advanced PAD and suffer from CLI.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P87_S1	These patients often have complex, calcified lesions in their lower leg, which are challenging to access and treat using the traditional femoral artery access site.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P87_S2	If left untreated, these cases may result in lower limb amputation.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P87_S3	Our family of 1.25mm Peripheral OASs with 4Fr compatibility allows for more options to treat those lesions by providing a low-profile system that is fully compatible with alternative access sites in the foot or ankle.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P87_S4	Smaller sheaths have been shown to reduce procedure times and decrease complications.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P88_S0	Our goal is to be the leading provider of solutions for the treatment of PAD and CAD.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P88_S1	We intend to broaden our product offering and expand to new international markets.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P88_S2	The key elements of our strategy include:
1180145_18_ITEM1_P89_S0	Drive Adoption through Our Direct U.S. Sales Organization, Medical Education and Key Opinion Leaders.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P89_S1	We expect to continue to drive adoption of the OAS in both hospital and office-based lab settings through the strong support of a clinically knowledgeable direct U.S. sales force focused on the needs of interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists and their cath lab teams.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P89_S2	A key element of our strategy is a focus on educating and training physicians about disease states, our clinical data, and proper use and application of OAS technology through programs delivered via physician faculty, our direct sales force and seminars where physician industry leaders discuss case studies and treatment techniques using the devices.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P90_S0	Build a Strong Portfolio of Clinical Evidence on Safety, Effectiveness and Economic Benefits of the OAS.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P90_S1	Physicians and payors are increasingly interested in clinical and economic evidence to support decisions regarding optimal treatment of patients.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P90_S2	We are focused on conducting robust clinical studies that provide insight into and demonstrate the effectiveness of the OAS in treating complex peripheral and coronary artery disease.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P90_S3	We believe that demonstrating the clinical advantages and cost-effectiveness of our OAS technology is critical to support physician adoption of the OAS, drive best clinical practice, and sustain ongoing reimbursement coverage for our devices.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P91_S0	Enhance OAS and Expand Product Portfolio within the Market for Treatment of Peripheral and Coronary Arteries.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P91_S1	In addition to continued innovation and product development on our peripheral and coronary OAS platforms, we are growing our product portfolio to offer new accessories and devices that improve outcomes and expand the patient population we can treat.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P91_S2	See Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships and Research and Development Activities - Development Activities for descriptions of new products in development.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P92_S0	In November 2016, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Medikit Co., Ltd. to sell the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown in Japan.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P92_S1	In March 2017, we received approval of that device from Japan s MHLW.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P92_S2	In February 2018, we announced reimbursement approval and our first commercially treated patient in Japan.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P92_S3	This represented our first entry into the international market, and most importantly, an opportunity to provide physicians in Japan with a cost-effective treatment option for the difficult-to-treat patient population with severely calcified coronary lesions.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P93_S0	In October 2014, we received CE Mark for our Stealth 360 Peripheral OAS device and we are planning to seek approval of other products in Europe.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P94_S0	In July 2018, we entered into an exclusive Distribution Agreement with OrbusNeich to sell our coronary and peripheral OAS outside of the United States and Japan.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P94_S1	We expect that OrbusNeich will commence sales of our products in certain countries in Southeast Asia, Europe and the Middle East during our fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, and we will closely collaborate with OrbusNeich on the timing of product introductions in each country under this Distribution Agreement.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P94_S2	OrbusNeich and its authorized sub-distributors will be responsible for selling our products, and we will focus our international efforts on physician training and education on our products.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P95_S0	Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships .
1180145_18_ITEM1_P95_S1	In addition to adding to our product portfolio through internal development efforts, we are opportunistically seeking ways to expand our portfolio through acquisitions, distribution agreements, licensing transactions, manufacturing agreements and other strategic partnerships to add new product lines and technologies that leverage our sales expertise and footprint or complement our strategic objectives.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P95_S2	In January 2018, we announced an exclusive U.S. distribution agreement with OrbusNeich to offer their full line of semi-compliant, non-compliant and specialty balloons for both coronary and peripheral vascular procedures.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P95_S3	Currently we are focused on offering their coronary balloons, including the Sapphire II Pro, which obtained FDA clearance in March 2018 as the first and only 1.0mm coronary balloon available in the United States.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P95_S4	In addition, we entered into an agreement with Integer Holdings Corporation to manufacture our ZILIENT peripheral guidewires, which are designed to provide tip resilience and crossability in challenging peripheral arterial lesions.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P95_S5	Finally, we entered into an agreement with Aerolase Corp. for the co-development of a new laser atherectomy device for physicians to use in more effectively treating multiple forms of arterial disease.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P96_S0	We study the most challenging patient populations and are committed to providing relevant clinical evidence that enables physicians to select and utilize the best treatment options for their patients.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P97_S0	A total of 6,121 subjects (4,788 PAD and 1,333 CAD) have been enrolled in our clinical studies as of June 30, 2018.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P97_S1	Our clinical studies incorporate rigorous long-term clinical and healthcare economic data that are critical to improving patient care and ongoing healthcare changes.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P98_S0	We have completed numerous clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Peripheral OAS.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P98_S1	Its unique mechanism of action differentiates the Peripheral OAS from other endovascular PAD treatment options and in our clinical studies of patients with the most challenging lesions, the Peripheral OAS consistently demonstrates successful lesion modification and durable results.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P99_S0	The following PAD clinical studies were completed or in process during fiscal 2018:
1180145_18_ITEM1_P100_S0	This prospective, observational, multi-center clinical study is evaluating the procedural and long-term clinical, quality of life and economic outcomes of endovascular device interventions, including orbital atherectomy, for the treatment of PAD.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P100_S1	We expect the results from this study to increase our understanding of the clinical and economic outcomes of endovascular treatment for PAD patients, including those with the most advanced form of the disease, Rutherford Class 6.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P101_S0	Enrollment of 1,204 subjects at 51 sites in the United States was completed in February 2016.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P102_S0	LIBERTY 360 two-year data was presented in August 2018.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P103_S0	The majority of devices used in the study were balloons and/or atherectomy, and the Peripheral OAS was the most frequently used atherectomy device.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P103_S1	The LIBERTY 360 data through two years demonstrated that peripheral interventions can be used successfully across all Rutherford classes, including the most challenging Rutherford Class 6 subjects.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P103_S2	Quality of life improved significantly from baseline to two years in all Rutherford groups.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P103_S3	An orbital atherectomy subanalysis of the LIBERTY 360 data indicated high freedom from major amputation at two years in all Rutherford Classes (RC2-3, 99.1%; RC4-5, 94.5%; and RC6, 79.8%).
1180145_18_ITEM1_P103_S4	Overall, the results of this novel all-comers PAD study suggest that peripheral vascular intervention ( PVI ) is an alternative to primary amputation in Rutherford Class 6 patients.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P103_S5	Additionally, data from the LIBERTY 360 study provide further evidence to support PVI treatment in Rutherford 2-5 patients.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P104_S0	This pilot, hypothesis generating, non-powered, multi-center, randomized clinical study conducted in Europe is designed to gather preliminary exploratory data regarding the acute and long-term clinical outcomes of orbital atherectomy with adjunctive DCB angioplasty versus DCB angioplasty alone in PAD patients with calcified, below-the-knee lesions.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P104_S1	We completed enrollment of fifty evaluable patients in May 2018, and these patients will be followed for up to two years.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P105_S0	We have conducted two clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Coronary OAS Classic Crown device: the ORBIT I feasibility study and the ORBIT II pivotal study.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P105_S1	The safety and efficacy of the Coronary OAS Micro Crown device were evaluated in the COAST study.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P106_S0	The following CAD clinical study was in process during fiscal 2018:
1180145_18_ITEM1_P107_S0	This post-market, randomized one-to-one, multi-center trial is designed to evaluate vessel preparation with Coronary OAS Classic Crown compared to conventional angioplasty technique prior to drug-eluting stent implantation for the treatment of severely calcified lesions.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P107_S1	Approximately 2,000 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 150 sites in the United States and subjects will be followed for up to two years.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P108_S0	The co-primary endpoints of acute minimum stent area (assessed by optical coherence tomography in a subset of equally randomized 500 subjects) and one-year target vessel failure are powered to demonstrate superiority of OAS vessel preparation vs. conventional angioplasty.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P109_S0	Our clinical portfolio is expanding as we develop future studies to answer difficult questions about PAD and CAD treatment.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P109_S1	Our clinical research continues to highlight the safety and efficacy of the OAS and current and new research illustrates our versatility in the emerging vascular market.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P110_S0	Our product research and development activities are dedicated to the development and commercialization of products that serve the peripheral and coronary vascular disease space, with emphasis towards high margin products and complex arterial disease states treated by our primary customers.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P110_S1	The focus and value proposition of our products is to enable positive acute and long-term clinical outcomes, with efficiency and predictability, in challenging patient subsets.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P111_S0	Research and development resources have been strategically allocated between opportunities that maximize the clinical effectiveness and user satisfaction of our OAS product line and the development of additional products that offer portfolio diversification and incremental revenue opportunities.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P112_S0	Specific to the peripheral vascular disease market, we will continue our commitment to patients suffering from CLI through a breadth of above-the-knee and below-the-knee differentiated products that treat or uniquely expand the ability of our devices to treat obstructive lesions throughout the leg and foot.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P112_S1	Most recently, we launched a line of extended length Diamondback 360 products (180 cm and 200 cm) that are intended to accommodate patient anatomy and physician preferred access methodology, for example radial access.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P113_S0	Specific to the coronary vascular disease market, we are building a portfolio of differentiated products that are used to treat complex CAD.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P113_S1	We launched a new coronary OAS feature called GlideAssist.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P113_S2	This feature is an innovative solution that facilitates device tracking, provides easier device repositioning, and provides enhanced performance in challenging anatomies.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P113_S3	We also recently launched our next generation saline infusion pump.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P113_S4	The pump is the reusable component of the system, and the next generation product has been updated to comply with new medical device standards and address numerous user satisfaction opportunities.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P113_S5	In addition, we entered into an agreement with Aerolase Corp. for the co-development of a new laser atherectomy device for physicians to use to more effectively treat multiple forms of arterial disease, and we are developing a new temporary hemodynamic support pump.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P113_S6	Emphasis in both franchises is placed on novel and differentiated devices that address unmet or under-met clinical or technical needs.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P114_S0	Research and development expenses for the years ended June 30, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 were $26.8 million , $22.9 million and $25.9 million , respectively.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P115_S0	We market and sell the majority of our products through a direct sales force in the United States.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P115_S1	Revenues for the years ended June 30, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 were $217.0 million , $204.9 million and $178.2 million , respectively.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P116_S0	We have targeted sales and marketing efforts to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists with experience using similar catheter-based procedures, such as angioplasty, stenting, and directional or laser atherectomy.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P117_S0	Professional education is also a key element of our sales strategy.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P118_S0	We target our marketing efforts to practitioners through medical conferences, seminars, peer-reviewed journals and marketing materials.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P118_S1	Our sales and marketing program focuses on:
1180145_18_ITEM1_P119_S0	developing relationships with key opinion leaders.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P120_S0	We sell the majority of our products through direct shipment to hospitals or clinics.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P121_S0	We are party to a purchasing agreement with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, L.P. ( HPG ), which was renewed effective May 1, 2018 and expires on July 31, 2021.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P121_S1	HPG acts as a group purchasing organization for the healthcare providers belonging to HPG as participants.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P121_S2	Under the purchasing agreement, all of HPG s participants located in the United States or its territories are eligible to purchase our orbital atherectomy systems and related products at prices set forth in the purchasing agreement.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P121_S3	The purchasing agreement may be terminated at any time, without cause, by HPG upon at least 60 days prior written notice to us.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P121_S4	Either party may terminate the purchasing agreement upon the occurrence of a material breach by the other party that goes uncured within 30 days following receipt of written notice of such breach.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P121_S5	If the purchasing agreement with HPG were to be terminated, our financial results will be materially adversely affected.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P122_S0	Outside of the United States, sales of our products in Japan are through our exclusive distributor, Medikit.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P122_S1	In July 2018, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with OrbusNeich to sell our Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS outside of the United States and Japan through OrbusNeich s current sales and distribution network.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P122_S2	For the year ended June 30, 2018, $1.8 million of our revenue was from sales in Japan, while the remaining revenues were from sales in the United States.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P122_S3	For the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, all of our revenues were from sales in the United States.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P123_S0	We have observed some degree of seasonality in our business, as there tends to be a lower number of procedures that use our products during the three months ending September 30.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P123_S1	Interventional procedure volume usually grows throughout the course of the fiscal year, with the quarter ending June 30 usually representing the highest volume of cases and, therefore, the highest amount of revenue generated by us during the course of the fiscal year.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P124_S0	We use internally-manufactured and externally-sourced components to manufacture the OAS.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P124_S1	Most of the externally-sourced components are available from multiple suppliers; however, certain key components, including the diamond-grit-coated crown and our ViperSlide Lubricant, are single sourced.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P124_S2	We have strategies and arrangements in place for procuring our key components from alternative suppliers in the event that one or more of our single source suppliers were to discontinue supplying us with a key component.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P124_S3	We assemble the shaft, crown and handle components on-site, and test, pack, seal and label the finished assembly before sending the packaged product to a contract sterilization facility.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P124_S4	Upon return from the sterilizer, the product is held in inventory prior to shipping to our customers.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P125_S0	We are located in a leased 125,000-square-foot corporate headquarters in Minnesota.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P125_S1	This custom-designed building has space for more than 500 employees and contains dedicated research and development, training and education, and manufacturing facilities.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P125_S2	Depending on staffing, the facility has the annual capacity to produce in excess of 75,000 devices per shift.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P125_S3	The finished goods storage has capacity for approximately 20,000 devices and more than 500 saline infusion pumps, as well as other accessory products.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P126_S0	Our leased Pearland, Texas facility is 46,000 square feet and includes a custom-built clean room and production space for future expansion of value-add processes, including machining and electronics assembly.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P126_S1	The facility, when fully staffed and equipped, also has the annual capacity to produce approximately 75,000 devices per shift.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P126_S2	This facility has finished goods storage capacity for greater than 15,000 devices and other accessory products and over 500 saline infusion pumps.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P127_S0	We believe that our facilities in Minnesota and Texas will provide adequate production, assembly, and warehousing capacity for the foreseeable future.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P128_S0	We are registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and comply with the FDA s Quality System Regulation ( QSR ).
1180145_18_ITEM1_P128_S1	We have opted to maintain a Quality Management System to enable us to market our products in the member states of the European Union, the European Free Trade Association and countries that have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements with the European Union.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P128_S2	We are ISO 13485:2003 certified, and our renewal is due in December 2018.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P128_S3	Under these registrations, our plants are audited by the FDA and our Notified Body.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P129_S0	The Stealth 360 Peripheral OAS has received CE Mark.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P129_S1	We are registered as a Foreign Medical Device Manufacturer in Japan and our registration certificate renewal is due in June 2021.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P130_S0	Third-party payors, including private insurers and government insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, pay for a significant portion of patient care provided in the United States.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P130_S1	The single largest payor in the United States is the Medicare program, a federal governmental health insurance program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ).
1180145_18_ITEM1_P130_S2	Medicare covers certain medical care expenses for eligible elderly and disabled individuals, including a large percentage of the population with PAD and CAD who could be treated with the OAS.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P130_S3	In addition, private insurers often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P130_S4	Consequently, Medicare s coverage and reimbursement policies are important to our operations.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P131_S0	CMS establishes Medicare reimbursement coverage policy and payment rates for physician and facility healthcare services, including procedures using atherectomy products.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P132_S0	Obtaining and maintaining coding, coverage and payment for our products is critical for commercial success.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P132_S1	We believe that physicians and hospitals that treat PAD and CAD with the respective OAS will generally be eligible to receive reimbursement from Medicare, as well as private insurers, that is adequate to cover the costs of OAS, associated materials, and physician s services.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P133_S0	With respect to reimbursement outside of the United States, in February 2018, the Coronary OAS Micro Crown received reimbursement approval in Japan, followed by the first commercial sales in Japan.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P133_S1	In connection with our Distribution Agreement with OrbusNeich, we and OrbusNeich will seek reimbursement approvals in other countries in connection with the commercial introductions of our products, to the extent that reimbursement is available and subject to local rules and regulations.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P134_S0	The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P134_S1	Our OAS compete with a variety of other products or devices for the treatment of vascular disease, including stents, balloon angioplasty catheters and atherectomy catheters, as well as products used in vascular surgery.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P134_S2	Competitors in the stent and balloon angioplasty market segments include Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific, Cook Medical, Johnson Johnson, Becton Dickinson, and Medtronic.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P134_S3	We also compete against manufacturers of atherectomy catheters and other products designed to treat vascular disease, including Medtronic, Philips/Spectranetics, Boston Scientific, Ra Medical, Shockwave and Avinger, as well as manufacturers that may enter the market due to the increasing demand for treatment of vascular disease.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P134_S4	Other competitors include pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs for the treatment of PAD and CAD and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral and coronary bypass procedures.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P135_S0	Because of the size of the peripheral opportunities, competitors and potential competitors have historically dedicated significant resources to aggressively promote their products.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P135_S1	We believe that our Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS compete primarily on the basis of:
1180145_18_ITEM1_P136_S0	We are aware of a company, Cardio Flow, Inc., developing an atherectomy system that could potentially compete with our products.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P137_S0	On August 27, 2012, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with Lela Nadirashvili, the widow of Dr. Leonid Shturman, our founder, relating to the ownership of certain patents invented by Dr. Shturman.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P137_S1	We believe that Ms. Nadirashvili assigned her rights under the Settlement Agreement, including the right to utilize certain patents, to Cardio Flow.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P138_S0	On April 6, 2018, we filed a breach of contract action against Cardio Flow in Minnesota District Court in Ramsey County, Minnesota, alleging that Cardio Flow has developed or is in the process of developing an atherectomy device that incorporates elements belonging exclusively to us, in violation of the Settlement Agreement.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P138_S1	We are seeking damages and a permanent injunction preventing Cardio Flow from taking further steps to develop or attempt to develop an atherectomy device that incorporates the elements that belong exclusively to us.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P138_S2	We are pursuing our claims against Cardio Flow vigorously.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P139_S0	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and other intellectual property laws, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P139_S1	As of June 2018, we held 52 issued U.S. patents and have 38 U.S. patent applications pending, as well as 175 granted foreign patents and 152 foreign patent applications pending, each of which corresponds to aspects of our U.S. patents and applications.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P139_S2	Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2019 and 2035, and our patents covering the core technology begin to expire in 2023 while providing core technology coverage through 2035.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P139_S3	We have many additional patents relating to our core technology currently pending in the USPTO, which will extend our key covered subject matter and coverage dates significantly.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P139_S4	Our issued patents and patent applications relate primarily to the design and operation of interventional atherectomy devices, including the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P139_S5	These patents and applications include claims covering key aspects of orbital atherectomy devices, including the design, manufacture and therapeutic use of certain atherectomy abrasive heads, drive shafts, control systems, handles and couplings.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P139_S6	As we continue to research and develop our atherectomy technology, we intend to file additional U.S. and foreign patent applications related to the design, manufacture and therapeutic uses of atherectomy devices.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P140_S0	In addition, we hold 22 registered U.S. trademarks, 17 registered marks in the Madrid Protocol with protection granted within at least one of Australia, the European Union, China, India, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Mexico, six registered marks in the European Union, 12 registered marks in Canada, eight registered marks in India, four registered marks in Mexico, and nine registered marks in Hong Kong.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P140_S1	We have multiple pending trademark applications worldwide.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P141_S0	We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P141_S1	We seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P141_S2	Agreements with our employees also forbid them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P141_S3	We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P142_S0	Governmental authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local levels and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of medical devices such as the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P143_S0	Failure to obtain approval to market our products under development and to meet the ongoing requirements of these regulatory authorities could prevent us from marketing and continuing to market our products.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P144_S0	The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( FDCA ) and the FDA s implementing regulations govern medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post market surveillance.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P144_S1	Medical devices and their manufacturers are also subject to inspection by the FDA.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P144_S2	The FDCA, supplemented by other federal and state laws, also provides civil and criminal penalties for violations of its provisions.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P145_S0	Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the United States will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P146_S0	The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization are premarket notification (also called 510(k) clearance) and PMA.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P147_S0	To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device legally marketed in the United States.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P147_S1	A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P147_S2	A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P148_S0	Generally, the 510(k) clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a year or more.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P149_S0	After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA (if the device as modified is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device).
1180145_18_ITEM1_P149_S1	The determination as to whether new authorization is needed is initially left to the manufacturer; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P149_S2	The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P150_S0	We received 510(k) clearances for the Peripheral OAS as set forth under Business Overview.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P151_S0	A PMA application requires the payment of significant user fees and must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P151_S1	A PMA application must also include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P152_S0	After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P152_S1	During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P152_S2	Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P152_S3	In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with the FDA s QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P153_S0	FDA review of a PMA application is required by statute to take no longer than 180 days, although the process typically takes significantly longer, and may require several years to complete.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P153_S1	The FDA can delay, limit, or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
1180145_18_ITEM1_P154_S0	changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P155_S0	If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P155_S1	When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P155_S2	If the FDA s evaluation of the PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny PMA or issue a not approvable letter.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P155_S3	The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA application.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P155_S4	Even if a PMA application is approved, the FDA may approve the device with an indication that is narrower or more limited than originally sought.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P155_S5	The agency can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of the device as a condition of approval, or impose post approval requirements such as continuing evaluation and periodic reporting on the safety, efficacy, and reliability of the device for its intended use.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P156_S0	New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P156_S1	PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P157_S0	Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P157_S1	These trials generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE ) to the FDA.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P157_S2	The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P157_S3	The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P157_S4	Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P158_S0	FDA approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P158_S1	With certain exceptions, changes made to an investigational plan after an IDE is approved must be submitted in an IDE supplement and approved by FDA (and by governing institutional review boards when appropriate) prior to implementation.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P159_S0	All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with regulations and requirements collectively known as good clinical practice.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P159_S1	Good clinical practices include the FDA s IDE regulations, which describe the conduct of clinical trials with medical devices, including the recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of sponsors and investigators, and labeling of investigational devices.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P159_S2	They also prohibit promotion, test marketing or commercialization of an investigational device and any representation that such a device is safe or effective for the purposes being investigated.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P159_S3	Good clinical practices also include the FDA s regulations for institutional review board approval and for protection of human subjects (such as informed consent), as well as disclosure of financial interests by clinical investigators.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P160_S0	Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P160_S1	The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P160_S2	The commencement or completion of any clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application or clearance of a premarket notification for numerous reasons.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P161_S0	After a device is cleared or approved for use and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P162_S0	product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device that may present a risk to health.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P163_S0	In addition, the FDA may require a company to conduct post market surveillance studies or order it to establish and maintain a system for tracking its products through the chain of distribution to the patient level.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P164_S0	Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions:
1180145_18_ITEM1_P165_S0	We and our contract manufacturers, specification developers and suppliers are also required to manufacture our products in compliance with current good manufacturing practice requirements set forth in the QSR.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P166_S0	The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing and record keeping.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P166_S1	The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P166_S2	If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers is not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to clear or approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P166_S3	Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P167_S0	Our operations are directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the FDCA, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P167_S1	These laws may impact, among other things, our sales, marketing, education and clinical programs.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P168_S0	The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P168_S1	Several courts have interpreted the statute s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P169_S0	The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P169_S1	Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P170_S0	The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P170_S1	Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P171_S0	In addition to the laws described above, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P172_S0	The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P172_S1	The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P173_S0	On June 28, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the U.S. government, acting through the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Western District of North Carolina (the DOJ ) and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (the OIG ) and Travis Thams to resolve the DOJ investigation of whether we violated the False Claims Act.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P173_S1	In connection with the resolution of this matter, we entered into a five-year corporate integrity agreement (the Corporate Integrity Agreement ) with the OIG.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P173_S2	The Corporate Integrity Agreement requires that we maintain our existing compliance programs and imposes certain expanded compliance-related requirements during the term of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, including establishment of specific procedures and requirements regarding consulting activities, co-marketing activities and other interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare institutions and the sale and marketing of our products; ongoing monitoring, reporting, certification and training obligations; and the engagement of an independent review organization to perform certain auditing and reviews and prepare certain reports regarding our compliance with federal health care programs.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P174_S0	The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, and certain state laws require persons to collect and report certain data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P174_S1	It is widely anticipated that public reporting under the Sunshine Act and implementing Open Payment regulations will result in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P175_S0	Voluntary industry codes, federal guidance documents and a variety of state laws address the tracking and reporting of marketing practices relative to gifts given and other expenditures made to doctors and other healthcare professionals.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P175_S1	In addition to impacting our marketing and educational programs, our internal business processes are and will continue to be affected by the numerous legal requirements and regulatory guidance at the state, federal and industry levels.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P176_S0	International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P176_S1	While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P176_S2	We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact the cost, the time needed to approve, and, ultimately, our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P176_S3	Regulations of the FDA and, as we continue our international expansions, regulatory agencies outside the United States, may impose extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on us and our operations.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P176_S4	Additionally, the time required to obtain approval in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P176_S5	For example, the primary regulatory environment in Europe with respect to medical devices is that of the European Union, which includes most of the major countries in Europe.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P176_S6	Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P177_S0	The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P177_S1	Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the European Union, although actual implementation of these directives may vary on a country-by-country basis.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P178_S0	The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of submission of a design dossier, self-assessment by the manufacturer, a third-party assessment, and review of the design dossier by a Notified Body.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P178_S1	This third-party assessment generally consists of an audit of the manufacturer s quality system and manufacturing site, as well as review of the technical documentation used to support application of the CE Mark to one s product and possibly specific testing of the manufacturer s product.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P179_S0	An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the European Union is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P180_S0	In July 2016, we submitted an application to Japan s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency ( PMDA ) for approval of our Coronary OAS Micro Crown and received approval in March 2017.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P180_S1	In February 2018, Japan became the first international market for any of our products.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P181_S0	As part of our Japan commercialization process we are subject to the requirements of the Japanese Act on Securing Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, Regenerative and Cellular Therapy Products, Gene Therapy Products, and Cosmetics (the PMD Act ).
1180145_18_ITEM1_P181_S1	Our quality management system and products are subject to review and examination by PMDA and subject to approval and enforcement by Japan s MHLW.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P181_S2	The critical suppliers named in our application are also subject to this review and examination for the activities they perform for us.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P182_S0	Non-compliance with the PMD Act could result in revocation or suspension of our license, revocation of approvals, and criminal sanctions such as fines and/or imprisonment.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P183_S0	In July 2018, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with OrbusNeich to sell our Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS outside of the United States and Japan.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P183_S1	In connection with the introduction of our products in each country under this distribution agreement, we will need to seek regulatory approvals of our products under the rules and regulations applicable in each such country and we will be required to comply with ongoing requirements, which may be varied and require us to expend substantial resources.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P184_S0	In addition, our international expansion, operations, distribution and sales will require us to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions and with U.S. and foreign export control, trade embargo and custom laws.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P185_S0	Our operations are subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P185_S1	We are currently classified and licensed as a Very Small Quantity Hazardous Waste Generator within Ramsey County, Minnesota.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P185_S2	There are no regulated wastes requiring licensing in our Texas facility.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P186_S0	As of June 30, 2018 , we had 652 full-time employees.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P186_S1	None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P187_S0	Scott R. Ward, Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P187_S1	Mr. Ward has been a member of our Board of Directors since November 2013 and has served as its Chairman since November 2014.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P187_S2	Mr. Ward served as our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer beginning November 30, 2015, and on August 15, 2016, Mr. Ward was appointed as our President and Chief Executive Officer.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P187_S3	Since 2013, Mr. Ward has been one of the Managing Directors at SightLine Partners.

1180145_18_ITEM1_P195_S0	Alexander Rosenstein, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
1180145_18_ITEM1_P196_S0	From October 2005 to September 2014, Mr. Rosenstein was an attorney at Fredrikson Byron, P.A., which provides legal services to us from time to time, and from September 1998 to September 2005, he was an attorney practicing in New York City.

1180145_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We have a history of net losses and a short commercialization experience, and we may continue to incur losses.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We were profitable in fiscal 2018 but have incurred net losses in each prior fiscal year since our formation in 1989.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	For the years ended June 30, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , we had net income (losses) of $ 1.7 million , $(1.8) million , and $(56.0) million , respectively.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	As of June 30, 2018 , we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $327.6 million .
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	We commenced commercial sales of the Peripheral OAS in September 2007 and the Coronary OAS in October 2013, and our short commercialization experience makes it difficult for us to predict future performance.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P1_S4	We expect to continue to incur significant expenses for sales and marketing, research and development, and manufacturing as we expand our product offering, launch our business in international markets and continue to commercialize the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS and develop and commercialize future versions of the Peripheral OAS, the Coronary OAS, and any future products.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Additionally, we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase to support business growth.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P1_S6	If we are unable to balance revenue growth and cost management, our operating losses may continue.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We may be unable to sustain our historical revenue growth.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Other than a 4.9% decline in revenue from sales of our Peripheral OAS during fiscal 2016, our revenue from sales of our OAS devices has grown in each of the fiscal years since we began commercialization in September 2007.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our ability to increase our revenues in future periods will depend on our ability to increase sales of the OAS and other products we introduce, which will, in turn, depend in part on our success in growing our customer base and reorders from those customers.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We may not be able to generate, sustain or increase revenues on a quarterly or annual basis.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	If we cannot achieve or sustain revenue growth for an extended period, our financial results will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The Peripheral OAS, the Coronary OAS and other products may never achieve broad market acceptance.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The Peripheral OAS, Coronary OAS, and other products we develop or market now or in the future may never gain broad market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The degree of market acceptance of any of our products will depend on a number of factors, including:
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	our reputation among physicians and hospitals.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Failure of our products to significantly penetrate current or new markets would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our customers may not be able to achieve adequate reimbursement for using the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS or other products, which could affect the acceptance of our products and cause our business to suffer.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved medical devices and procedures is uncertain.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The commercial success of our products is substantially dependent on whether third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement for the use of such products and related services are available.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We expect our products to continue to be purchased by hospitals and other providers who will then seek reimbursement from various public and private third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers, for the services provided to patients.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	While third-party payors are currently providing reimbursement for our products, we can give no assurance that these third-party payors will continue to provide adequate reimbursement for use of the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS and our other products to permit hospitals and doctors to consider the products cost-effective for patients requiring treatment, or that current reimbursement levels for our products will continue.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P9_S4	In addition, the overall amount of reimbursement available for PAD and CAD treatment could decrease in the future.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain sufficient reimbursement could cause our business to suffer.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement, and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for use of our products.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In order to position our products for acceptance by third-party payors, we may have to agree to lower prices than we might otherwise charge.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Governmental and private sector payors have instituted initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs using, for example, price regulation or controls and competitive pricing programs.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Some third-party payors also require demonstrated superiority, on the basis of randomized clinical trials, or pre-approval of coverage, for new or innovative devices or procedures before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such devices or procedures.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	It is uncertain whether our current products or any future products we may develop will be viewed as sufficiently cost-effective to warrant adequate coverage and reimbursement levels.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In addition, in June 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the U.S. government, acting through the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina (the DOJ ) and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (the OIG ), and Travis Thams, and a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement with the OIG.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In the event of a breach of the Settlement Agreement or the Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could be excluded from participation in federal health care programs.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products is limited or not available, the acceptance of our products and, consequently, our business will be substantially harmed.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Healthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	There have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control healthcare costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system, some of which have been enacted into law, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Patient Act.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The Patient Act and any additional healthcare proposals and laws that may be enacted in the future could also limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The Patient Act and future healthcare legislation could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The U.S. Congress has in the past considered legislation to repeal, modify or replace the Patient Act.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We cannot predict the outcome of these efforts and, as a result, we cannot predict the effect that any such repeal, modification or replacement will have on our business and results of operations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our financial performance may be adversely affected by medical device tax provisions in the health care reform legislation.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The imposition of the 2.3% medical device excise tax enacted as part of the Patient Act has adversely affected our financial results and has required, and will continue to require, us to identify ways to reduce spending in other areas or raise additional capital to offset the increased expense.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Although the excise tax has been suspended by Congress until the end of 2019, its status is unclear for subsequent years.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We have not been able to pass along the cost of the tax to our customers or offset the cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting from the expansion of health insurance coverage and do not expect to be able to do so in the future.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Ongoing implementation of this legislation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We have limited data and experience regarding the safety and efficacy of the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Any long-term data that is generated may not be positive or consistent with our limited short-term data, which would affect market acceptance of these products.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Because our technology is relatively new in the treatment of PAD and CAD, we have performed clinical trials only with limited patient populations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The long-term effects of using the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS in a large number of patients have not been studied and the results of short-term clinical use of the Peripheral OAS or the Coronary OAS do not necessarily predict long-term clinical benefits or reveal long-term adverse effects.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We are conducting and developing several clinical trials, and there are substantial risks and uncertainties involved in these trials.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We must devote substantial resources to our clinical trials, clinical trials often take several years to develop and conduct, there are difficulties involved in locating sites and patients to participate in our clinical trials, and the results of every trial are uncertain until the trial is completed.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P20_S4	These uncertainties could adversely impact our financial results, our reputation and the reputation of our products.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Clinical trials conducted with the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS have involved procedures performed by physicians who are very technically proficient.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Consequently, both short and long-term results reported in these studies may be significantly more favorable than typical results achieved by physicians, which could negatively impact market acceptance of the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS and materially harm our business.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We face significant competition, must innovate to stay competitive, and may be unable to sell the Peripheral OAS, the Coronary OAS or any other products at profitable levels.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The market for medical devices is highly competitive, dynamic and marked by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovation.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our ability to compete depends on our ability to innovate successfully, and, while certain barriers exist to entry into our market, we cannot assure that new entrants or existing competitors will not be able to develop products that compete directly with our products.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We compete against very large and well-known stent and balloon angioplasty device manufacturers, atherectomy catheter manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral and coronary bypass procedures.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	We may have difficulty competing effectively with these competitors because of their well-established positions in the marketplace, significant financial and human capital resources, established reputations and worldwide distribution channels.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	develop more effective or less expensive products or technologies that render our technology or products obsolete or non-competitive.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We have encountered and expect to continue to encounter potential customers who, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to or prefer the products offered by these competitors.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In addition, increased consolidation in the healthcare industry has resulted in companies with greater market power, which increases competition for goods and services.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We experience significant competition on the pricing of our products and expect to continue to experience pressure from our customers to lower our prices.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our customers may require lower pricing in connection with contract renewals or otherwise for us to continue to sell our products to them.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In addition, if our Purchasing Agreement with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, L.P. is terminated, our financial results will be materially adversely affected.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	If we are unable to compete successfully, our revenue will suffer.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Increased competition might lead to price reductions and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Competitive pressures may decrease the demand for our products and could adversely affect our financial results.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our efforts to develop new products may not be successful or the new products may not provide the revenue we expect.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We plan to add to our product portfolio through both internal development efforts and through acquisitions, distribution agreements, licensing transactions, manufacturing agreements and other strategic partnerships.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	These new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Even if we successfully develop new products or enhancements or new generations of our existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors innovations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	We cannot provide certainty as to when or whether any of our products under development will be launched, whether we will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Failure to launch successful new products or technologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause our products or technologies to become obsolete, causing our revenues and operating results to suffer.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We have limited commercial manufacturing experience and could experience difficulty in producing the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS or may need to depend on third parties to manufacture the products.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We have limited experience in commercially manufacturing the Peripheral OAS, even less experience in commercially manufacturing the Coronary OAS and no experience manufacturing these products in the quantities that we anticipate will be required if we achieve planned levels of commercial sales.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	As a result, we may not be able to develop and implement efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to manufacture the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS or future products in significant volumes, while meeting the legal, regulatory, quality, price, durability, engineering, design and production standards required to market our products successfully.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The forecasts of demand we use to determine order quantities and lead times for components purchased from outside suppliers may be incorrect.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Our failure to obtain required components or subassemblies when needed and at a reasonable cost would adversely affect our business.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In addition, we may in the future need to depend upon third parties to manufacture the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS and future products.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Any difficulties in locating and hiring third-party manufacturers, or in the ability of third-party manufacturers to supply quantities of our products at the times and in the quantities we need, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We depend upon third-party suppliers, including single source suppliers to us and our customers, making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We rely on third-party suppliers to provide us with certain components of our products and to provide key components or supplies to our customers for use with our products.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We rely on single source suppliers for certain components of the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS, including the diamond-grit-coated crown and our ViperSlide Lubricant.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In some cases, we do not have long-term supply agreements with, or guaranteed commitments from, our suppliers, including single source suppliers.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	We depend on our suppliers to provide us and our customers with materials in a timely manner that meet our and their quality, quantity and cost requirements.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P36_S4	These suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand and our customers demands.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P36_S5	These suppliers may cease producing the components we purchase from them or otherwise decide to cease doing business with us.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Any supply interruption from our suppliers or failure to obtain additional suppliers for any of the components used in our products would limit our ability to manufacture our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We are dependent on our senior management team and highly skilled personnel, and our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain personnel necessary for our success.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We are highly dependent on our senior management and other key personnel.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Our success will depend on our ability to retain senior management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, including sales and marketing professionals, scientists, clinical specialists, engineers and other highly skilled personnel and to integrate current and additional personnel in all departments.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	The loss of members of our senior management, sales and marketing professionals, scientists, clinical and regulatory specialists and engineers could prevent us from achieving our objectives of continuing to grow our company.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P39_S3	We do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We have increased the size of our organization and may need to do so in the future, and we may experience difficulties managing growth.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	If we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business, our future revenue and operating results may be adversely affected.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We have significantly expanded the size of our organization over the past three years, particularly in the number of sales and marketing personnel, and may need to do so in the future.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The growth we may experience in the future may provide challenges to our organization, requiring us to also rapidly expand other aspects of our business, including our manufacturing operations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Rapid expansion in personnel may result in less experienced people producing and selling our products, which could result in unanticipated costs and disruptions to our operations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	If we cannot scale and manage our business appropriately, our anticipated growth may be impaired and our financial results will suffer.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We intend to sell our products internationally in the future, but we may experience difficulties in obtaining approval to do so or in successfully marketing our products internationally even if approved.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Currently, substantially all of our revenues are in the United States, and in fiscal 2018, commercial sales of certain of our products commenced in Japan, which became the first international market for our products.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We intend to further expand our international sales in the future, both in Japan with Medikit and in the rest of the world under our Distribution Agreement with OrbusNeich.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	There can be no guarantee that we will receive approval to sell our products in any additional countries or that any of our approvals will be maintained, nor can there be any guarantee that any sales would result even if such approval is received.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P43_S3	We will be substantially reliant upon Medikit and OrbusNeich for our international sales, and any failure of such distributors to effectively sell our products could have a material adverse effect on our international efforts and harm our financial position.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P43_S4	In addition, we will incur substantial expenses in connection with international expansion.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Our inability to successfully enter international markets and manage business on a global scale could negatively affect our financial results.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We may require additional financing, and our failure to obtain additional financing when needed could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We may be dependent on additional financing to execute our business plan.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	In the event we need or desire additional financing, we may be unable to obtain it by borrowing money in the credit markets or raising money in the capital markets.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P45_S3	If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, we may terminate or delay the development of one or more of our products, or delay establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We face a risk of non-compliance with the financial covenants in our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We are party to a loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	This agreement requires us to maintain, among other things, either (i) minimum unrestricted cash at Silicon Valley Bank and unused availability on our line of credit of at least $10.0 million or (ii) minimum trailing three-month Adjusted EBITDA of $1.0 million and contains customary events of default, including, among others, the failure to comply with certain covenants or other agreements.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, amounts due under the agreements may be accelerated by Silicon Valley Bank.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	If we are unable to meet the financial or other covenants under the current loan and security agreement or negotiate future waivers or amendments of such covenants, events of default could occur under the agreement.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the agreement, Silicon Valley Bank has available a range of remedies customary in these circumstances, including declaring all outstanding debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to be due and payable, foreclosing on the assets securing the agreement and/or ceasing to provide additional loans under our line of credit, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The restrictive covenants under this agreement could limit our ability to obtain future financing, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	The financial and restrictive covenants contained in this agreement could also adversely affect our ability to respond to changing economic and business conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies that may be subject to fewer restrictions.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Transactions that we may view as important opportunities, such as acquisitions, may be subject to the consent of Silicon Valley Bank, which consent may be withheld or granted subject to conditions specified at the time that may affect the attractiveness or viability of the transaction.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We lease our corporate headquarters, which subjects us to ongoing payment obligations and compliance with certain covenants.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	On March 30, 2017, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	In connection with such sale, we entered into a lease agreement for our corporate headquarters, which has an initial term of fifteen years, with four consecutive renewal options of five years each.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Under this lease, we are obligated to pay a base annual rent in the first year of $1,637,500 with annual escalations of 3%.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P51_S3	If we are unable to make such rent payments or comply with the other covenants contained in the lease, the landlord could take certain actions against us, up to and including termination of the lease, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial conditions.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Our stock price is volatile and subject to significant fluctuations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Market prices for securities of early-stage pharmaceutical, medical device, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Our common stock traded as low as $20.58 and as high as $34.51 per share during the 12-month period ended June 30, 2018 .
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Moreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, the corporation s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by 5-percent shareholders that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We may have experienced an ownership change in the past and we may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock, some of which may be outside our control.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P59_S1	As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards or other pre-change tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	An interruption in or breach of security of our information or manufacturing systems could cause a loss of business or damage to our reputation.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We rely on information and communication systems in our manufacturing and in the conduct our business.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	If there is any failure or interruption of these systems, such an incident could cause failures or disruptions in our customer relationship systems or product manufacturing.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P61_S2	In addition, we could be subject to a cyber incident, such as an intentional attack or an unintentional event that involves a third party gaining unauthorized access to our systems, which could disrupt our operations, corrupt our data, or result in release of our confidential information.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P61_S3	The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or cyber incidents could cause a loss of business or damage to our reputation and have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act ) was signed into law on December 22, 2017.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P63_S1	The Tax Act made numerous changes to U.S. federal corporate tax law and is expected to reduce our effective tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2018 and future periods.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Act lowers the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and prompts various other changes to U.S. federal corporate tax law.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We have assessed the impact the Tax Act with our professional advisors which resulted in the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	The impact the Tax Act will have on us in future periods is uncertain and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The effects of hurricanes, flooding and other natural disasters may impact our sales, inventories and supply availability, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	In August and September 2017, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma made landfall along the Texas Gulf Coast and in the State of Florida, respectively, bringing high winds, unprecedented rain and extreme flooding to those areas.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P66_S1	A significant portion of our sales is generated from these areas.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Procedure volumes in the Houston area and in Florida decreased during the pendency and immediate aftermath of the hurricanes and flooding, which decreased the number of our products used during this time.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Any sustained decrease in procedure volumes from hurricanes and other natural disasters that affect any areas in which our customers are located will result in decreased sales in these areas and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	In addition, we maintain a 46,000-square foot production facility in Pearland, Texas, which is just outside of Houston in southeast Texas.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P67_S1	The storm and its aftermath did not cause damage to our Pearland facility.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P67_S2	However, any future loss of operations at the Pearland facility as a result of natural disasters eliminates an alternate production source in the event that our manufacturing capacity at the Minnesota facility is disrupted for any reason.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Any disruptions in our ability to timely manufacture and supply our products to our customers could cause us to experience delays in recognizing revenue or even to lose sales altogether, and any additional hurricanes, flooding or other natural disasters affecting areas in which our products are sold could result in decreased numbers of cases using our products.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Our ability to market the Peripheral OAS in the United States is limited to use as a therapy in patients with PAD and our ability to market the Coronary OAS in the United States is limited to use as a therapy in patients with severely calcified CAD, and if we want to expand our marketing claims, we will need to file for additional FDA clearances or approvals and conduct further clinical trials, which would be expensive and time consuming and may not be successful.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We received FDA 510(k) clearances in the United States for use of the Peripheral OAS as a therapy in patients with PAD, and we received PMA to use the Coronary OAS as a therapy in patients with severely calcified CAD.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P70_S1	These general clearances and approvals restrict our ability to market or advertise the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS beyond these uses and could affect our growth.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	If we determine to market our orbital technology in the United States for other uses, we would need to conduct further clinical trials and obtain premarket approval from the FDA.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Clinical trials are complex, expensive, time consuming, uncertain and subject to substantial and unanticipated delays.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P71_S2	There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain FDA approval to use our orbital atherectomy technology for applications other than the treatment of PAD and CAD.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We are or will be subject to an extensive set of post-market controls that apply to us as we commercialize our products, including annual PMA reports, Medical Device Reports on serious adverse events, complaint handling and analysis under the FDA s QSR, export controls, advertising and promotion requirements, and potential post-market studies required by the FDA.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We and our suppliers are also subject to regulation by various state authorities, which may inspect our or our suppliers facilities and manufacturing processes and enforce state regulations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Failure to comply with applicable state regulations may result in seizures, injunctions or other types of enforcement actions.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our promotion of the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS is closely controlled by the FDA and enforcement activities could limit our ability to inform potential customers of the features of the products.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our products may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation and product liability claims that could exceed the limits of available insurance coverage.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	The FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material regulatory deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P76_S1	For example, since commercialization of the Peripheral OAS, we have had instances of recalls, including, in the year ended June 30, 2017 minor recalls involving guidewires and the OAS saline infusion pump recall discussed below.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Any recalls of our products or products that we distribute would divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation with customers and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Also, if any of our products is defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contain defective components or are misused, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P77_S1	The use, misuse or off-label use of our products may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P77_S2	We cannot prevent a physician from using any of our products for off-label applications.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P77_S3	While we have product liability insurance coverage for our products and intend to maintain such insurance coverage in the future, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected from claims that are brought against us.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P78_S0	The recall of our saline infusion pumps could adversely affect our business and financial results, harm our reputation and result in legal claims against us.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P79_S0	In April 2017, we initiated a voluntary recall of one type of our saline infusion pumps.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P79_S1	While we have made design changes to this pump and have launched a next generation pump to address the issues that led to the recall, it is possible that we did not adequately assess the cause and effect of these issues and we may not have adequately modified the pump design in order to prevent these issues from happening in the future.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Any additional problems with our pumps could cause delays in the ability of our customers to perform procedures using our devices and prevent us from adding new customers who may not have access to other pumps that can be used in procedures, which could harm our reputation with customers, adversely affect our ability to generate revenue, and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P79_S3	Any future pump recall would harm our reputation and divert managerial and sales force attention and financial resources from other aspects of our business and would require us to incur substantial expense.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We are subject to many laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our products and related manufacturing processes, clinical data, adverse events, recalls and corrections and promotional activities are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory bodies.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P81_S1	In particular, we are required to comply with the QSR and other regulations, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product for which we obtain marketing clearance or approval.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P81_S2	We are also responsible for the quality of components received by our suppliers.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P81_S3	Failure to comply with the QSR requirements or other statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or failure to adequately respond to any observations, could result in, among other things:
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P82_S0	If any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales to suffer.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Our operations are also subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P84_S0	In addition, our relationships with physicians, hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny under various federal anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws, as further described below.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P85_S0	If our operations are found to be in violation of these laws, we, as well as our employees, may be subject to penalties, including monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration health programs, workers compensation programs and TRICARE (the healthcare system administered by or on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense for uniformed services beneficiaries, including active duty and their dependents, retirees and their dependents), and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P86_S0	In addition, we have agreements with federal, state and local government agencies, such as the Veterans Administration, and third-party healthcare providers that receive government funding to sell our products.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P86_S1	We are subject to extensive regulatory compliance obligations in the award, performance and administration of our government contracts, including regulations relating to procurement integrity, pricing protection, export control, government security, employment practices, accuracy of records and the recording of costs.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P86_S2	The other parties to these agreements have the right to audit us to determine whether we are in compliance with these agreements.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P86_S3	Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, repayment of amounts, the assessment of penalties and fines, and/or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting in the future, any of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting kickbacks and false and fraudulent claims which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Additionally, any challenges to or investigations into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P88_S0	The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, and similar state laws, prohibit payments that are intended to induce health care professionals or others either to refer patients or to purchase, lease, order or arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease or order of healthcare products or services.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P88_S1	A number of states have enacted laws that require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report payments, gifts and other remuneration made to physicians and other health care professionals and health care organizations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P88_S2	In addition, some state statutes, most notably laws in Massachusetts and Vermont, impose outright bans on certain gifts to physicians as well as requiring reporting of payments to physicians.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P88_S3	Some of these laws, referred to as aggregate spend or gift laws, carry substantial fines if they are violated.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P89_S0	The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, requires us to collect and report certain data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P90_S0	It is widely anticipated that public reporting under the Sunshine Act and implementing Open Payments regulations will result in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, physicians and teaching hospitals.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P91_S0	These anti-kickback, public reporting and aggregate spend laws affect our sales, marketing, promotional and clinical activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers or users of medical devices.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P91_S1	They also impose additional administrative and compliance burdens on us.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P91_S2	In particular, these laws influence, among other things, how we structure our sales offerings, including discount practices, customer support, education and training programs, physician consulting and other service arrangements, and clinical trials.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P91_S3	If we were to offer or pay inappropriate inducements to purchase our products, we could be subject to a claim under the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute or similar state laws.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P91_S4	If we fail to comply with particular reporting requirements, we could be subject to penalties under applicable federal or state laws.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P91_S5	Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payments to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or for items or services that were not provided as claimed.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P91_S6	Although we do not submit claims directly to government healthcare programs or other payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims by providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, by providing improper financial inducements, or through certain other activities.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P92_S0	In providing billing and coding information to customers, we make every effort to ensure that the billing and coding information furnished is accurate and that treating physicians understand that they are responsible for all treatment decisions.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P92_S1	Nevertheless, we cannot provide assurance that the government will regard any billing errors that may be made as inadvertent or that the government will not examine our role in providing information to our customers and physicians concerning the benefits of therapy with our devices.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P92_S2	Likewise, our financial relationships with customers, physicians, or others in a position to influence the purchase or use of our products may be subject to government scrutiny or be alleged or found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P93_S0	False claims laws prescribe civil, criminal and administrative penalties for noncompliance, which can be substantial.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Moreover, an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business and results of operations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P94_S0	On May 8, 2014, we received a letter from the DOJ stating that it was investigating us to determine whether we had violated the False Claims Act, and on June 28, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the United States of America, acting through the DOJ and on behalf of the OIG, and Travis Thams, who filed the qui tam complaint underlying the DOJ s investigation (the Civil Action ), to resolve the investigation by the DOJ and the Civil Action.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P94_S1	The existence of the investigation and subsequent settlement could negatively affect our reputation and harm our business and results of operations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P94_S2	In addition, the release we received from the government in the Settlement Agreement related to particular conduct alleged in the complaint underlying the investigation.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P94_S3	If the government determines that other conduct alleged in the complaint for which the government did not grant us a release merits additional investigation or if the government pursues any action against us relating to this other alleged conduct, then we may need to expend additional amounts to defend ourselves, our management would undergo the distraction of additional investigation and potential litigation, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Compliance with the terms and conditions of our Corporate Integrity Agreement requires significant resources and management time and, if we fail to comply, we could be subject to penalties or, under certain circumstances, excluded from government healthcare programs, which would materially adversely affect our business.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P96_S0	On June 28, 2016, we entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement with the OIG.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P96_S1	The Corporate Integrity Agreement requires that we maintain our existing compliance programs and imposes certain expanded compliance-related requirements during the term of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, including establishment of specific procedures and requirements regarding consulting activities, co-marketing activities and other interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare institutions and the sale and marketing of our products; ongoing monitoring, reporting, certification and training obligations; and the engagement of an independent review organization to perform certain auditing and reviews and prepare certain reports regarding our compliance with federal health care programs.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P96_S2	Maintaining the broad array of processes, policies and procedures necessary to comply with the Corporate Integrity Agreement will require a significant portion of management s attention and the application of significant resources.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P96_S3	The costs associated with implementation of and compliance with the Corporate Integrity Agreement could be substantial and may be greater than we currently anticipate.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P96_S4	In addition, while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program, we cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants or our contractors are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and/or laws, all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or laws and/or all requirements of the Corporate Integrity Agreement.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P96_S5	In the event of a breach of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could become liable for payment of certain stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal health care programs.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P96_S6	The costs associated with compliance with the Corporate Integrity Agreement, or any liability or consequences associated with its breach, could have an adverse effect on our business, revenues, earnings and cash flows.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses, may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries, as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P98_S1	These disclosure requirements require ongoing due diligence efforts and disclosure obligations.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P98_S2	There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P98_S3	In addition, our ongoing implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Our anticipated international expansion will subject us to increased legal and regulatory requirements, which could have a material effect on our business.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P100_S0	In February 2018, Medikit, our exclusive distributor in Japan, commenced sales of our Coronary OAS Micro Crown, and, in July 2018, we entered into an exclusive Distribution Agreement with OrbusNeich to sell our Peripheral and Coronary OAS outside of the United States and Japan.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P100_S1	We expect sales by OrbusNeich to commence in Southeast Asia, Europe and the Middle East in the year ending June 30, 2019.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P100_S2	Movement into international markets will subject us and our products to different and increased laws and regulations, including foreign medical device regulations; tax laws; increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; export laws; and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P100_S3	Although we have and will continue to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, distributors and agents, as well as those companies to which we will outsource certain aspects of our business operations, including those based in foreign countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will comply with our internal policies.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P100_S4	Medikit and OrbusNeich may appoint sub-distributors of our products and we will have limited ability to control the actions of these sub-distributors, but we may be held responsible by governmental authorities for the actions of these sub-distributors.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P100_S5	We will incur additional compliance costs associated with global operations, and any alleged or actual violations of these laws and regulations could subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil fines, sanctions and other liabilities, and prohibitions on business conduct, and could negatively affect our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P101_S0	New regulatory requirements will impose additional burdens on us, and our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to satisfy all applicable new requirements in a timely fashion.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P102_S0	New regulations impacting our products are periodically adopted.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P102_S1	These regulations may require us to change our existing product designs in order to continue marketing our products, which could result in increased expenditures and in risks that we may be unable to successfully change our designs to satisfy the new requirements.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P102_S2	For example, IEC 60601-1-2 (4th Edition) was published in July 2014 and updates the performance requirements with respect to electromagnetic interference for medical devices.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P102_S3	In the United States, the 4th Edition requirements go into effect on December 31, 2018 for new devices and devices that have undergone substantial changes.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P102_S4	We have taken steps to ensure that our products sold in the United States will be compliant with the 4th Edition requirements, but we could experience technical and regulatory delays.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P102_S5	If our products do not meet the 4th Edition standards, we may be delayed in launching new products or selling existing products that require material changes, including, for example, as a result of a change of supplier or quality issues.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P102_S6	Any delays in selling our products resulting from non-compliance with 4th Edition and other new regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P103_S0	The impact of restrictive trade policies in the United States and the potential corresponding actions by other countries could adversely affect our financial performance.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P104_S0	The U.S. federal government has recently implemented tariffs on certain products imported into the United States from China, and the Chinese government has responded with retaliatory tariffs on certain products, including medical devices, exported from the United States to China.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P104_S1	We cannot predict whether the United States will implement additional trade restrictions with respect to China or other countries and how such countries would respond to such trade restrictions.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P104_S2	If these tariffs continue or are expanded, they would make it more difficult to sell our products in China or other markets outside of the United States, if we seek to expand into the Chinese or other markets in the future, and they may increase the costs of procuring component parts for our products from China or other countries.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P104_S3	Restrictive trade policies may also harm the United States and global economies generally, which would adversely affect our business in a variety of ways, including reducing the market for our products, causing a downturn in the trading price of our common stock, and restricting access to credit if we seek it for future growth.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could allow our competitors and others to produce products based on our technology, which could substantially impair our ability to compete.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Our success and ability to compete depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P106_S1	We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P106_S2	Our issued patents and related intellectual property may not be adequate to protect us or permit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P106_S3	Also, we cannot be assured that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P106_S4	Further, if any patents we obtain or license are deemed invalid and unenforceable, or have their scope narrowed, it could impact our ability to commercialize or license our technology and achieve competitive advantages.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P107_S1	In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, if at all.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P108_S0	We may, in the future, need to assert claims of infringement against third parties to protect our intellectual property.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P108_S1	The outcome of litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in patents, copyrights, trade secrets or trademarks is highly unpredictable, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, reputation and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Despite our efforts to safeguard our unpatented and unregistered intellectual property rights, we may not be successful in doing so or the steps taken by us in this regard may not be adequate to detect or deter misappropriation of our technology or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our products, technology or other information that we regard as proprietary.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P109_S1	In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to litigate, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P109_S2	Additionally, third parties may be able to design around our patents.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P110_S0	We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P110_S1	In this regard, we seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by having a policy that our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P110_S2	We cannot provide any assurance that employees and third parties will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements, or that we will be effective in securing necessary assignments from these third parties.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others could prohibit us from commercializing products, require us to obtain licenses from third parties or require us to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages and injunctive relief.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P112_S0	The medical technology industry is characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P112_S1	The likelihood that patent infringement or misappropriation claims may be brought against us increases as we achieve more visibility in the marketplace and introduce products to market.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P113_S0	We are aware of numerous patents issued to third parties that relate to the manufacture and use of medical devices for the treatment of vascular disease.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P113_S1	The owners of each of these patents could assert that the manufacture, use or sale of our products infringes one or more claims of their patents.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P113_S2	There could also be existing patents of which we are unaware that one or more aspects of our technology may inadvertently infringe.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P113_S3	In some cases, litigation may be threatened or brought by a patent-holding company or other adverse patent owner who has no relevant product revenues and against whom our patents may provide little or no deterrence.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P114_S0	Any infringement or misappropriation claim could cause us to incur significant costs, place significant strain on our financial resources, divert management s attention from our business and harm our reputation.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P114_S1	If the relevant patents were upheld in litigation as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe, we could be prohibited from commercializing any infringing products unless we could obtain licenses to use the technology covered by the patent or are able to design around the patent.
1180145_18_ITEM1A_P114_S2	We may be unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may not be able to redesign any infringing products to avoid infringement.
1180145_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal executive offices are located in our headquarters, a 125,000 square foot facility in St. Paul, Minnesota, which contains dedicated research and development, training and education, and manufacturing facilities, and our central administrative offices.
1180145_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	In March 2017, we sold the Minnesota facility and entered into an agreement to lease the facility through March 2032.
1180145_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	In September 2009, we entered into an agreement to lease a 46,000 square foot production facility in Pearland, Texas beginning in April 2010 and continuing through April 2020.
1180145_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	This facility primarily accommodates additional manufacturing activities.
1180145_18_ITEM2_P2_S0	We believe that our current facilities are substantially adequate for our current and anticipated future needs for the foreseeable future.
1180145_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	We trade on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol CSII.
1180145_18_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for our common stock (based upon intra-day trading) as reported by the Nasdaq Global Market:
1180145_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	The number of record holders of our common stock on August 17, 2018 was approximately 139.
1180145_18_ITEM5_P1_S1	No cash dividends have been previously paid on our common stock and none are anticipated during the year ending June 30, 2019 .
1180145_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	For information on our equity compensation plans, refer to Item 12, Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.
1180145_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return of our common stock ( CSII ) with the return of the Standard Poor s 500 Stock Index ( S P ) and the S P Health Care Index ( S P HC ) from June 30, 2013, through June 30, 2018.
1180145_18_ITEM5_P3_S1	The comparisons assume $100 was invested on June 30, 2013 in our common stock, the S P 500 Stock Index and the S P Health Care Index and also assumes that any dividends are reinvested.
1180145_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	The returns set forth on the following graph are based on historical results and are not intended to suggest future performance.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	You should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our business and operations, based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance, that involve risks and uncertainties.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many important factors, including the factors we describe under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are a medical technology company leading the way in the effort to successfully treat patients suffering from peripheral and coronary artery diseases, including those with arterial calcium, the most difficult arterial disease to treat.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	We are committed to clinical rigor, constant innovation and a defining drive to set the industry standard to deliver safe and effective medical devices that improve lives of patients facing these difficult disease states.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our Peripheral OAS products are catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of plaque types in leg arteries both above and below the knee, including calcified plaque, and address many of the limitations associated with other existing surgical, catheter and pharmacological treatment alternatives.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	The micro-invasive devices use small access sheaths that can provide procedural benefits and allow physicians to treat PAD patients in even the small and tortuous vessels located below the knee and facilitate access through alternative sites in the ankle, foot and wrist, as well as in the groin.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	The United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has granted us 510(k) clearances for our Peripheral OAS as a therapy in patients with PAD, as discussed in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-K.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our coronary arterial disease ( CAD ) product, the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS ( Coronary OAS ), is marketed as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	The Coronary OAS is a catheter-based platform designed to facilitate stent delivery in patients with CAD who are acceptable candidates for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or stenting due to de novo, severely calcified coronary artery lesions.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	The Coronary OAS design is similar to technology used in our Peripheral OAS, customized specifically for the coronary application.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	In January 2018, we announced our relationship with OrbusNeich to be the exclusive U.S. distributor of OrbusNeich balloon products.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	In March 2018, the FDA granted 510(k) clearance for the OrbusNeich 1.0mm Sapphire 11 Pro coronary balloon ( 1.0mm balloon ).
1180145_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	The 1.0mm balloon, the first and only 1.0mm coronary balloon available in the U.S., offers industry-leading entry and crossing profiles and is precision engineered for crossing and treating extremely tight and complex lesions.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P5_S3	We anticipate OrbusNeich s full balloon product portfolio will become available in the United States in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	In November 2016, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Medikit Co., Ltd.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	( Medikit ) to sell our Coronary and Peripheral OAS in Japan.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	In March 2017, we received approval from Japan s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for our Coronary OAS Micro Crown.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P6_S3	On February 1, 2018, the Coronary OAS Micro Crown received reimbursement approval in Japan, followed by the first commercial sales, making Japan the first international market for any of our products.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Coronary OAS Micro Crown is the only atherectomy device designed to both pilot tight, calcific lesions and treat 2.5 to 4mm vessels with a single device.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	In October 2014, we received CE Mark for our Stealth 360 Peripheral OAS device.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	In July 2018, we entered into an exclusive Distribution Agreement with OrbusNeich to sell our Peripheral and Coronary OAS outside of the United States and Japan.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	We expect that OrbusNeich will commence sales of our products in certain countries in Southeast Asia, Europe and the Middle East during our fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	We derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of Peripheral OAS, the Coronary OAS and ancillary products in the United States.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	The Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS each use a disposable, single-use, low-profile catheter that travels over our proprietary ViperWire guide wire.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	The systems use a saline infusion pump as a power supply for the operation of the catheter.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	Additional ancillary products include the ViperSlide Lubricant, ViperTrack Radiopaque Tape, OrbusNeich balloons, and ZILIENT guidewires.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	We have observed some degree of seasonality in our business, as there tends to be a lower number of procedures that use our products during the three months ending September 30.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	Interventional procedure volume usually grows throughout the course of the fiscal year, with the quarter ending June 30 usually representing the highest volume of cases and, therefore, the highest amount of revenue generated by us during the course of the fiscal year.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	We assemble the single-use catheter with components purchased from third-party suppliers, as well as with components manufactured in-house.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	Balloons and guide wires are purchased from third-party suppliers.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead, and purchased finished goods.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses include compensation for executive, sales, marketing, finance, information technology, human resources and administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation and facilities overhead.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	Other significant expenses include bad debt expense, travel, marketing costs, professional fees and professional education.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing, enhancement and regulatory approval of our products.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	Research and development expenses include employee compensation including stock-based compensation, supplies and materials, patent expenses, consulting expenses, travel and facilities overhead.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	We also incur significant expenses to operate clinical trials, including trial design, third-party fees, clinical site reimbursement, data management and travel expenses.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P15_S3	All research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Approved patent applications are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Other (income) and expense, net primarily includes interest expense from amounts owed under the lease of our headquarters facility and DOJ settlement, and interest income from money market funds.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	We have established valuation allowances to fully offset our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty about our ability to generate the future taxable income necessary to realize these deferred assets, particularly in light of our historical losses.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	The future use of net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on us attaining profitable operations and will be limited in any one year under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 due to significant ownership changes (as defined in Section 382) resulting from our equity financings.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	At June 30, 2018 , we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax reporting purposes of approximately $275.0 million , which will expire at various dates through fiscal 2037.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect amounts reported in those statements.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	Our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, deferred revenue and stock-based compensation, are updated as appropriate at least quarterly.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P19_S3	We use authoritative pronouncements, our technical accounting knowledge, cumulative business experience, valuation specialists, judgment and other factors in the selection and application of our accounting policies.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P19_S4	While we believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments that we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements are appropriate, these estimates, assumptions and judgments are subject to factors and uncertainties regarding their outcome.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P19_S5	Therefore, actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Some of our significant accounting policies require us to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	We sell the majority of our products via direct shipment to hospitals or clinics, and in fiscal 2018 we began shipping to our distributor in Japan.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	Revenue recognition may occur upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site, based on the contract terms.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P21_S3	We record estimated sales returns, discounts and rebates as a reduction of net sales.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Deferred revenue associated with the upfront payment received under our distribution agreement with Medikit is recognized in relation to the estimated future sales under the agreement.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	The short term portion represents the expected amount of deferred revenue that will be recognized over the next year.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	The estimate of future sales under contract will continue to be assessed and adjusted accordingly.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period the revenue is recognized.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	Cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	We have stock-based compensation plans that include nonvested share awards and an employee stock purchase plan.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	We determine the fair value of nonvested share awards with market conditions using the Monte Carlo simulation.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	Fair value of nonvested share awards that vest based upon performance or time conditions is determined by the closing market price of our stock on the date of grant.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	Stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period for the awards expected to vest.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Fair value of shares purchased under the employee stock purchase plan are estimated on the grant date, which is the first date in the six-month purchase period.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	Stock-compensation expense is recognized over the purchase period based on the anticipated amount of shares to be purchased.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Management s key assumptions are developed with input from independent third-party valuation advisors.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	During the years ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $10.3 million , $10.4 million , and $13.0 million , respectively.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	In accordance with FASB guidance, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements related to legal proceedings when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	If a loss is reasonably possible, but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands), and, for certain line items, the changes between the specified periods:
1180145_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Net revenues increased by $12.1 million , or 5.9% , from $204.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 , to $217.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2018 .
1180145_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	Revenues from our Peripheral OAS increased $6.9 million, or 4.9%, due to an increase in the number of devices sold, partially offset by decreases to average selling price, the adverse effect of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and a recall of a version of our saline infusion pump during fiscal 2018.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	Sales of our Coronary OAS increased by approximately $2.2 million, or 4.7%, reflecting an increase in devices sold.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P32_S3	The increase in Peripheral and Coronary OAS sales is primarily due to the expansion of our customer base.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P32_S4	We also had $1.8 million of revenue from sales in Japan as commercialization commenced in February 2018, which includes $383,000 related to the deferred up-front payment from Medikit.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P32_S5	Other product revenue increased $2.1 million, or 7.4%, during the year ended June 30, 2018 , driven by increased sales of our Peripheral and Coronary OAS, which the other products support.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Prior to February 2018, all of our revenues have been in the United States; however, sales in Japan commenced in February 2018.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	In November 2016, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Medikit to sell our Peripheral and Coronary OAS in Japan, and in March 2017, we received approval from Japan s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for our Coronary OAS Micro Crown.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	On February 1, 2018, the Coronary OAS Micro Crown received reimbursement approval in Japan, followed by the first commercial sales, making Japan the first international market for any of our products.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	In July 2018, we entered into an exclusive Distribution Agreement with OrbusNeich to sell our Peripheral and Coronary OAS outside of the United States and Japan.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P33_S4	We expect that sales under this agreement will commence in fiscal 2019.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P33_S5	We expect our revenue to increase as we continue to increase the number of physicians using the devices, increase the usage per physician, introduce new and improved products such as the OrbusNeich balloons and ZILIENT guidewires, generate additional clinical data, and expand into new geographies, partially offset by potential decreases in average selling prices.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	Cost of goods sold increased 0.1% , from $39.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 to $39.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2018 .
1180145_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	These amounts represent the cost of materials, labor and overhead for single-use catheters, guide wires, pumps, and other ancillary products.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	The small increase in cost of goods sold was due to greater unit volumes offset by the $1.5 million one-time charge in the year ended June 30, 2017 related to the voluntary recall of one type of our saline infusion pumps, as well as lower costs per unit driven by manufacturing efficiencies and cost reductions in the current year ended June 30, 2018 .
1180145_18_ITEM7_P34_S3	Gross margin increased to 81.8% for the year ended June 30, 2018 from 80.8% for the year ended June 30, 2017 due to lower costs per unit, as discussed above.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P34_S4	Cost of goods sold for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 includes $275,000 and $689,000 , respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P34_S5	We expect that gross margin for the year ending June 30, 2019 will decrease slightly compared to the year ended June 30, 2018, as an increasing amount of revenue will be derived from lower margin products and international markets.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Quarterly margin fluctuations could occur based on production volumes, timing of new product introductions, sales mix, pricing changes, or other unanticipated circumstances.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses .
1180145_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $4.5 million , or 3.1% , from $144.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 to $148.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2018 .
1180145_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	The increase was primarily due to increased payroll related expenses due to the expansion of clinical specialists in our sales organization, severance benefits, as well as litigation and other legal expenses.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P36_S3	These amounts were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P36_S4	Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 include $9.1 million and $8.7 million , respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P36_S5	We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase as revenue grows in fiscal 2019, but at a rate slightly less than the rate of revenue growth.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	Research and development expenses increased by $3.8 million , or 16.8% , from $22.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 to $26.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2018 .
1180145_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	Research and development expenses relate to the specific projects to develop new products or expand into new markets, such as the development of new versions of our Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS, and ancillary products, and PAD and CAD clinical studies.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	The increase was primarily due to the ramp-up of our ECLIPSE clinical study and new development projects.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P37_S3	Research and development expenses for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 include $1.0 million for stock-based compensation.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P37_S4	We generally expect to incur higher research and development expenses in fiscal 2019 than amounts incurred for the year ended June 30, 2018 as we continue enrollment in the ECLIPSE clinical study and invest in expanding our product portfolio.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P37_S5	Fluctuations could occur based on the number of projects and studies and the timing of expenditures.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	Net revenues increased by $26.7 million, or 15.0%, from $178.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016, to $204.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2017.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	Revenues from our Peripheral OAS increased $13.5 million, or 10.5%, primarily reflecting an 11.5% increase in the number of devices sold.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	Sales of our Coronary OAS increased by approximately $11.2 million, or 31.2%, reflecting 32.2% more devices sold.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	The increase in Peripheral and Coronary OAS sales are primarily due to the expansion of our customer base.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P38_S4	Other product revenue increased $2.0 million, or 14.1%, during the year ended June 30, 2017, driven by increased sales of our Peripheral and Coronary OAS, which the other products support.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Cost of goods sold increased by $4.0 million, or 11.3%, from $35.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 to $39.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2017.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	These amounts represent the cost of materials, labor and overhead for single-use catheters, guide wires, pumps, and other ancillary products.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	The increase was primarily due to increased sales levels and a one-time charge of $1.5 million related to the initiation of a voluntary recall of one type of our saline infusion pumps, partially offset by lower costs per unit driven by manufacturing efficiencies and cost reductions.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P39_S3	Gross margin increased to 80.8% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 80.1% for the year ended June 30, 2016 due to lower costs per unit, as discussed above.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P39_S4	Cost of goods sold for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 includes $689,000 and $794,000, respectively, for stock-based compensation.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by $18.4 million, or 11.3%, from $162.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 to $144.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 primarily due to lower payroll-related and travel expenses from a decrease in headcount from the year ended June 30, 2016, commission plan changes, $1.5 million of fiscal 2016 costs associated with the departure of our former CEO, and a reduction in medical device excise tax expense due to the suspension of the tax effective January 1, 2016.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	Partially offsetting the decreases was a charge of $1.3 million for employment litigation costs and an increase in incentive compensation expense due to performance.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 include $8.7 million and $10.4 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation, which decreased due to the reduction in headcount and a change in vesting terms for our performance-based restricted stock awards granted in fiscal 2017 from those granted in fiscal 2016.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Research and development expenses decreased by $3.0 million, or 11.7%, from $25.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 to $22.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2017.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	Research and development expenses relate to the specific projects to develop new products or expand into new markets, such as the development of new versions of our Peripheral and Coronary OAS, and ancillary products, and PAD and CAD clinical studies.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	The decrease primarily related to the completion of enrollment in several of our clinical studies and lower payroll-related expenses from a decrease in headcount from the year ended June 30, 2016.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P41_S3	Partially offsetting these were higher patent expense and incentive compensation expense due to performance.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	2017 and 2016 include $1.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation, which decreased due to the reduction in headcount.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	In March 2016, we announced a broad-based restructuring to reduce costs as a key part of our plan to balance revenue growth with a pathway to profitability and positive cash flow.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	As a result, we recorded a restructuring expense of $2.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2016, which was comprised of severance and other employee related costs.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	There were no additional charges related to restructuring activities.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	On June 28, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the United States of America, acting through the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina (the DOJ ) and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and Travis Thams (the Relator ), to resolve the previously disclosed investigation by the DOJ and the qui tam complaint filed by the Relator pursuant to the False Claims Act in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	We recorded an $8.0 million legal settlement expense during the year ended June 30, 2016.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	To supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, our management uses a non-GAAP financial measure referred to as Adjusted EBITDA.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP measure expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands):
1180145_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	Adjusted EBITDA improved as compared to the prior year due to the increased earnings from operations.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of performance and believe this measure facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by factoring out potential differences caused by depreciation and amortization expense and non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA to analyze the underlying trends in our business, assess the performance of our core operations, establish operational goals and forecasts that are used to allocate resources and evaluate our performance period over period and in relation to our competitors operating results.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	Additionally, our management is partially evaluated on the basis of Adjusted EBITDA when determining achievement of their incentive compensation performance targets.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P47_S3	Management does not use this Adjusted EBITDA measure as a liquidity measure or in the calculation of our financial covenants under the revolving credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	We believe that presenting Adjusted EBITDA provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	We also believe that providing this information better enables our investors to understand our operating performance and evaluate the methodology used by our management to evaluate and measure such performance.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	The following is an explanation of each of the items that management excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and the reasons for excluding each of these individual items:
1180145_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	Our management believes that excluding this item from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand the application of stock-based compensation guidance and its impact on our operational performance and ability to make additional investments in our company, and it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Our management believes that excluding these items from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand our operational performance and ability to make additional investments in our company.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	Some of the limitations associated with our use of these non-GAAP financial measures are:
1180145_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Items such as stock-based compensation do not directly affect our cash flow position; however, such items reflect economic costs to us and are not reflected in our Adjusted EBITDA, and therefore these non-GAAP measures do not reflect the full economic effect of these items.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore other companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	Our management exercises judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures we use.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily upon our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	We had cash and cash equivalents of $116.3 million and $107.9 million at June 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	As of June 30, 2018 , we had an accumulated deficit of $327.6 million .
1180145_18_ITEM7_P57_S2	The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to net cash provided by our operating and financing activities during the year ended June 30, 2018 .
1180145_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	A summary of our cash flow activities is as follows:
1180145_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $9.7 million , $19.6 million , and $(23.6) million for the years ended June 30, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	For the years ended June 30, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , we had a net income (loss) of $1.7 million , $(1.8) million , and $(56.0) million , respectively, and stock based compensation expense of $10.3 million , $10.4 million , and $13.0 million , respectively.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P59_S2	Significant changes in working capital during these periods included:
1180145_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	Cash provided by (used in) prepaid expenses and other current assets was $2.3 million , $(1.8) million , and $728,000 during the years ended June 30, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively, primarily due to payment timing of vendor deposits and other expenditures.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	During the year ended June 30, 2018, we also received proceeds from an insurance receivable related to a litigation settlement payment.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	Cash (used in) provided by accrued expenses and other liabilities was $(6.6) million , $725,000 , and $10.9 million during the years ended June 30, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	Cash used during the year ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to the amount and timing of compensation payments, as well as a litigation settlement payment.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	Cash provided during the year ended June 30, 2017, was primarily due to the amount and timing of compensation payments.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P61_S3	Cash provided during the year ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to the restructuring accrual, benefits related to our former CEO s departure, and the DOJ legal settlement expense.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Cash provided by deferred revenue was $189,000 and $10.0 million during the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	During the year ended June 30, 2017, Medikit made an upfront payment of $10.0 million to us in connection with the exclusive distribution agreement with Medikit to sell our Coronary and Peripheral OAS in Japan.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	Medikit also provides advance payments for orders under the terms of the agreement, and, therefore, deferred revenue is recorded until products are accepted by Medikit.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Net cash used in investing activities was $5.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2018, compared with $1.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	The increase was due to a $2.5 million cost method investment made in June 2018, partially offset by the collection of a note receivable.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	Net cash used in investing activities was $1.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, compared with $3.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	The decrease was primarily due to property and equipment purchases and sales of available-for-sale marketable securities under the deferred compensation plan.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2018, compared with $29.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2017.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	The decrease was primarily driven by $20.9 million of cash proceeds received from the sale of the Facility in March 2017, described below and a lesser amount of cash proceeds from stock options received in the year ended June 30, 2018, as there were fewer stock options outstanding.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	Net cash provided by financing activities was $29.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, compared with $4.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	The increase was primarily driven by $20.9 million of cash proceeds received from the sale of the Facility in March 2017, as described below, and a greater amount of cash proceeds from stock option exercises during the year ended June 30, 2017.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	Our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including the extent and duration of future operating losses, the level and timing of future sales and expenditures, the results and scope of ongoing research and product development programs, working capital required to support our business operations, the receipt of and time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals, our sales and marketing programs, the continuing acceptance of our products in the marketplace, competing technologies, market and regulatory developments, ongoing facility requirements, potential strategic transactions (including the potential acquisition of, or investments in, businesses, technologies and products), international expansion, and the existence, defense and resolution of legal proceedings.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	to compliance with our Corporate Integrity Agreement (as defined below), payments under our lease agreements, payments under severance agreements, and anticipated costs relating to litigation.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	We intend to retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of our business.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P69_S2	We do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	On June 28, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the United States of America, acting through the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Western District of North Carolina (the DOJ ) and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (the OIG ), and Travis Thams, pursuant to which we will pay $8.0 million as follows: an initial payment of $3.0 million, which we paid on July 1, 2016, with the remaining $5.0 million, which bears interest at 1.8% per annum, payable in 11 equal quarterly installments, beginning January 1, 2017.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	Under the settlement agreement, if we make a single payment in excess of $2.0 million, which payment is not covered by an insurance policy, in settlement of any claims before paying the full settlement amount, the remaining unpaid balance of the settlement amount will become immediately due and payable, with interest accruing on the unpaid principal portion at an interest rate of 1.8% per annum.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	In connection with the resolution of this matter, we entered into a five-year corporate integrity agreement (the Corporate Integrity Agreement ) with the OIG.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P71_S1	The Corporate Integrity Agreement requires that we maintain our existing compliance programs and imposes certain expanded compliance-related requirements during the term of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, including establishment of specific procedures and requirements regarding consulting activities, co-marketing activities and other interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare institutions and the sale and marketing of our products; ongoing monitoring, reporting, certification and training obligations; and the engagement of an independent review organization to perform certain auditing and reviews and prepare certain reports regarding our compliance with federal health care programs.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P71_S2	In the event of a breach of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could become liable for payment of certain stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal health care programs.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P71_S3	The Corporate Integrity Agreement requires us to invest additional amounts in our compliance program and pay fees and expenses of the independent review organization.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	On December 29, 2016, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement, as subsequently amended (collectively, the Sale Agreement ), with Krishna Holdings, LLC (the Buyer ), providing for the sale to Buyer of our headquarters facility in St. Paul, Minnesota (the Facility ), for a cash purchase price of $21.5 million.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	On March 30, 2017, the sale of the Facility under the Sale Agreement closed.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P72_S2	We received proceeds of approximately $20.9 million ($21.5 million less $556,000 of transaction expenses).
1180145_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not limited to:
1180145_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the potential acquisition of, or investments in, businesses, technologies and products, although we have no current understandings, commitments or arrangements to do so.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion over the use of these net proceeds.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	In connection with the closing of the Facility sale, we entered into a Lease Agreement (the Lease Agreement ) with Krishna Holdings, LLC, Apex Holdings, LLC, Kashi Associates, LLC, Keva Holdings, LLC, S V Ventures, LLC, Polo Group LLC, SPAV Holdings LLC, Star Associates LLC, and The Global Villa, LLC.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	The Lease Agreement has an initial term of fifteen years, with four consecutive renewal options of five years each, with a base annual rent in the first year of $1.6 million and annual escalations of 3%.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P76_S2	See Notes 2 and 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	On March 31, 2017, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement ) with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB ).
1180145_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	The Loan Agreement provides for a senior, secured revolving credit facility (the Revolver ) of $40.0 million (the Maximum Dollar Amount ).
1180145_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	Advances under the Revolver may be made from time to time up to the Maximum Dollar Amount, subject to certain borrowing limitations.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	The Revolver has a maturity date of March 31, 2020 and bears interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the Wall Street Journal prime rate, less 0.25%.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P78_S2	Interest on borrowings is due monthly and the principal balance is due at maturity.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P78_S3	Borrowings up to $10.0 million are available on a non-formula basis.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P78_S4	Borrowings above $10.0 million are based on (i) 85% of eligible domestic accounts receivable, and (ii) the lesser of 50% of eligible inventory or $5.0 million, subject to adjustment as defined in Loan Agreement.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	Upon the Revolver s maturity, any outstanding principal balance, unpaid accrued interest, and all other obligations under the Revolver will be due and payable.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	We will incur a fee equal to 1% of the Maximum Dollar Amount upon termination of the Loan Agreement or the Revolver for any reason prior to the maturity date, unless refinanced with SVB.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	Our obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by certain of our assets, including, among other things, accounts receivable, deposit accounts, inventory, equipment, general intangibles and records pertaining to the foregoing.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	The collateral does not include our intellectual property, but we agreed not to encumber our intellectual property without the consent of SVB.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	The Loan Agreement contains customary covenants limiting our ability to, among other things, incur debt or liens, make certain investments and loans, enter into transactions with affiliates, undergo certain fundamental changes, dispose of assets, or change the nature of its business.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	In addition, the Loan Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain, at all times when any amounts are outstanding under the Revolver, either (i) minimum unrestricted cash at SVB and unused availability on the Revolver of at least $10.0 million or (ii) minimum trailing three-month Adjusted EBITDA of $1.0 million.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P81_S2	If we do not comply with the various covenants under the Loan Agreement, the interest rate on outstanding amounts will increase by 5% and SVB may, subject to various customary cure rights, decline to provide additional advances under the Revolver, require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Revolver, and foreclose on all collateral.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	Under the Loan Agreement, we paid SVB a non-refundable commitment fee of $80,000, which will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the Loan Agreement.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	We are required to pay a fee equal to 0.35% per annum on the unused portion of the Revolver, payable quarterly in arrears.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P82_S2	SVB s obligations to advance funds under the Revolver are subject to an initial collateral examination to be completed within 90 days of the effective date of the Loan Agreement.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P82_S3	We are not obligated to draw any funds under the Revolver and no amounts are outstanding as of June 30, 2018 .
1180145_18_ITEM7_P82_S4	We currently do not have plans of borrowing under the Loan Agreement.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	Our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of June 30, 2018 are summarized below:
1180145_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	(1) The amounts represent future minimum payments under a non-cancellable operating lease for our Texas production facility along with equipment leases.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	(2) The amounts represent future minimum payments due under the capital lease related to the sale leaseback of our Facility.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P84_S2	(4) Consists of payments and related interest associated with the DOJ settlement discussed above.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P84_S3	(5) Includes severance related to various severance agreements.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at June 30, 2018, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P85_S1	Therefore, $597,000 of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business and operating results during the periods presented.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	Since inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued amended revenue recognition guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	The guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods or services.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P88_S2	The guidance also requires expanded disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P88_S3	Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P88_S4	We have completed an adoption plan, which included a review of customer contracts, applying the five-step model of the new standard to the customer contracts and comparing the results to our current accounting.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P88_S5	We have elected the modified retrospective method of adoption, which we anticipate will not result in a material adjustment to retained earnings.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P88_S6	Our revenue recognition will remain largely unchanged given the majority of our revenue arrangements consist of a single performance obligation that will be recognized at a point in time when control passes to the customer.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P88_S7	As a result, we do not anticipate a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in our consolidated financial statements.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P88_S8	We are also implementing new internal controls around the judgments needed to address risks associated with applying the five-step model, which includes identifying performance obligations and judgments made related to variable consideration.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P88_S9	Effective July 1, 2018, we will be revising our revenue recognition accounting policy and disclosures to reflect the requirements of the amended revenue recognition guidance.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P88_S10	We will continue to monitor any modifications or interpretations communicated by the FASB that may impact any of its final assessments related to the guidance.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which revises the accounting requirements related to the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	The update also changes certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P89_S2	These changes will require an entity to measure, at fair value, investments in equity securities and recognize the changes in fair value within net income.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P89_S3	ASU 2016-01 will be applied on a modified retrospective basis to all outstanding instruments, with an adjustment recorded to opening retained earnings as of the beginning of the first period in which the guidance becomes effective.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P89_S4	The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P89_S5	The guidance is effective for us on July 1, 2018.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	We do not anticipate a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	The guidance requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P91_S2	ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, and should be applied using a modified retrospective approach.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P91_S3	The guidance is effective for us on July 1, 2019.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P91_S4	We are currently evaluating the timing, method of adoption and impact of the new lease guidance on our financial statements.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which revises guidance for the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments within its scope.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	The new standard introduces an approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments and modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	The new approach to estimating credit losses (referred to as the current expected credit losses model) applies to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	Early adoption is permitted and should be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P94_S2	The guidance is effective for us on July 1, 2020.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P94_S3	We do not anticipate a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Scope of Modification Accounting which clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as modifications.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P95_S1	The new guidance will reduce diversity in practice and result in fewer changes to the terms of an award being accounted for as modifications.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P95_S2	ASU 2017-09 will be applied prospectively to awards modified on or after the adoption date.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P95_S3	The guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	We do not anticipate a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements.
1180145_18_ITEM7_P97_S1	Such forward-looking information is included in this Form 10-K and in other materials filed or to be filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by the Company).

1180145_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk.
1180145_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Additionally, we have certain available-for-sale marketable securities under our deferred compensation plan.
1180145_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on these available-for-sale marketable securities.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2018, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ).
1180145_18_ITEM8_P1_S1	We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1180145_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P2_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting under item 9A.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P3_S1	Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P3_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P4_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P5_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P5_S2	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P5_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P5_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P5_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since at least 2003, which includes periods before the Company became subject to SEC reporting requirements.

1180145_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (the Company ), based in St. Paul, Minn., is a medical device company focused on developing and commercializing innovative solutions for treating vascular and coronary disease.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P14_S1	The Company s Orbital Atherectomy Systems ( OAS ) treat calcified and fibrotic plaque in arterial vessels throughout the leg and heart in a few minutes of treatment time, and address many of the limitations associated with existing surgical, catheter and pharmacological treatment alternatives.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	The consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, after elimination of all intercompany transactions and accounts.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company considers all money market funds and other investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	Customer credit terms are established prior to shipment with the general standard being net 30 days.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P17_S2	Collateral or any other security to support payment of these receivables generally is not required.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P17_S3	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is an estimate regularly evaluated by the Company for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience, credit quality of the customer base, age of the receivable balances, both individually and in the aggregate, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P17_S4	Provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts attributed to bad debt are recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	The following table shows the allowance for doubtful accounts activity:
1180145_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out method of valuation.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	The establishment of inventory allowances for excess and obsolete inventories is based on estimated exposure on specific inventory items.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company writes down its inventories as it becomes aware of any situation where the carrying amount exceeds the estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future demands and market conditions.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	Property and equipment is carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 40 years for the building; five to seven years for production equipment and furniture and fixtures; three years for computer equipment and software; and the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term for leasehold improvements.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P21_S2	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs and minor renewals and betterments that do not extend or improve the life of the respective assets are expensed as incurred.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P21_S3	All other expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P21_S4	The assets and related depreciation accounts are adjusted for property retirements and disposals with the resulting gains or losses included in the consolidated statement of operations.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	The capitalized costs incurred to obtain patents are amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P22_S1	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	The recoverability of capitalized patent costs is dependent upon the Company s ability to derive revenue-producing products from such patents or the ultimate sale or licensing of such patent rights.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	Patent recoverability is regularly reviewed and any patents that are abandoned are written off at the time of abandonment.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	The Company regularly evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or that the remaining estimated useful life should be changed.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P25_S1	The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated by the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company leases its Texas manufacturing facilities under an operating lease agreement.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	The lease contains rent escalation clauses for which the lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P26_S2	Rent expense that is recognized but not yet paid is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	In March 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to lease its Minnesota facility.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P27_S1	The lease agreement has an initial term of fifteen years, with four consecutive renewal options of five years each at the Company's option.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P27_S2	As the lease terms resulted in a capital lease classification, the Company accounted for the sale and leaseback of its Minnesota facility as a financing transaction where the assets remain on the Company's balance sheet and a financing obligation was recorded for $20,944.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P27_S3	As lease payments are made, they will be allocated between interest expense and a reduction of the financing obligation, resulting in a value of the financing obligation that is equivalent to the net book value of the assets at the end of the lease term.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P27_S4	At the end of the lease (including any renewal option terms), the Company will remove the assets and financing obligation from its balance sheet.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Company sells the majority of its products via direct shipment to hospitals or clinics.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P28_S1	The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P28_S2	Revenue recognition may occur upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site, based on the contract terms.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P28_S3	The Company records estimated sales returns, discounts and rebates as a reduction of net sales.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	Deferred revenue associated with the upfront payment received under the Company s distribution agreement with Medikit is recognized in relation to the estimated future sales under the agreement.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	The short term portion represents the expected amount of deferred revenue that will be recognized over the next year.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P29_S2	The estimate of future sales under contract will continue to be assessed and adjusted accordingly.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	Costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period the revenue is recognized.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	Cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	In November 2016, the Company signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Medikit Co., Ltd.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	( Medikit ) to sell its Coronary and Peripheral OAS in Japan.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P31_S2	To secure exclusive distribution rights, Medikit made an upfront payment of $10,000 to the Company, which is refundable based on the occurrence of certain events during the term of the agreement.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P31_S3	The Company has classified the payment as current or long-term based on its expectation of when revenue will be recognized and is re-evaluated on a quarterly basis.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P31_S4	Medikit also provides advance payments for orders under the terms of the agreement, and, therefore, deferred revenue is recorded until products are accepted by Medikit.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	The Company provides its customers with the right to receive a replacement if a product is determined to be defective at the time of shipment.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P32_S1	Warranty reserve provisions are estimated based on Company experience, volume, and expected warranty claims.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P32_S2	Warranty reserve, provisions and claims were as follows:
1180145_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	In April 2017, the Company initiated a voluntary recall of one type of its saline infusion pumps that resulted in a reserve of approximately $1,535 incurred in fiscal 2017, relating to estimated costs of the recall.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Company and its operations from time to time are, and in the future may be, parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P34_S1	The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P34_S2	When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues an amount based on management s best estimate considering all facts and circumstances.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 imposed a medical device excise tax on medical device manufacturers on their sales in the United States of certain devices, which was effective January 1, 2013.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	The excise tax is 2.3% of the taxable base and applied to a substantial majority of the Company s sales.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P36_S2	Effective January 1, 2016, the excise tax was suspended until the end of 2017, and in January 2018, another temporary two year suspension of the tax was passed, extending the suspension to December 31, 2019.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P36_S3	The Company incurred $1,273 of expense related to the tax during the year ended June 30, 2016.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	Developing a provision for income taxes, including the effective tax rate and the analysis of potential tax exposure items, if any, requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws, regulations and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	The Company s judgment and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	Accounting guidance requires that accounting for uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in the financial statements.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	The guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P39_S2	Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P39_S3	The guidance also provides rules on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing, enhancement and regulatory approval of the Company s products.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P40_S1	Research and development expenses include employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), supplies and materials, consulting expenses, patent amortization, travel and facilities overhead.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P40_S2	The Company also incurs significant expenses to operate clinical trials, including trial design, third-party fees, clinical site reimbursement, data management and travel expenses.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P40_S3	Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P40_S4	Expenses associated with patent applications are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over their remaining estimated lives.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P40_S5	Patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval, and does not exceed 20 years .
1180145_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Company maintains its cash balances primarily with one financial institution.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P42_S1	These balances exceed federally insured limits.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P42_S2	The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in cash and cash equivalents.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company believes that the credit risk related to marketable securities is limited due to the adherence to an investment policy and that credit risk related to accounts receivable is limited due to a large customer base.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company s marketable securities consist solely of available-for-sale securities and were valued in accordance with the fair value measurement guidance discussed below.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P44_S2	Realized gains and losses, if any, are calculated on the specific identification method and are included in interest and other, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	Available-for-sale securities are reviewed for possible impairment at least quarterly, or more frequently if circumstances arise that may indicate impairment.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	When the fair value of the securities declines below the amortized cost basis, impairment is indicated and it must be determined whether it is other than temporary.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P45_S2	Impairment is considered to be other than temporary if the Company: (i) intends to sell the security, (ii) will more likely than not be forced to sell the security before recovering its cost, or (iii) does not expect to recover the security s amortized cost basis.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P45_S3	If the decline in fair value is considered other than temporary, the cost basis of the security is adjusted to its fair market value and the realized loss is reported in earnings.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P45_S4	Subsequent increases or decreases in fair value are reported in equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
1180145_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	When the Company controls less than 20% of the decision-making ability over the operations of the investee, the investment is accounted for at cost.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	Cost method investments are reviewed quarterly for any events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P46_S2	When the fair value declines below the cost, an impairment loss is recognized unless it is considered temporary.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P46_S3	Impairment is considered to be other than temporary if the length of time it will take for the investment s value to exceed its cost is greater than the Company s intent and ability to hold the investment.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	Under the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	The authoritative guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	The categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	The hierarchy is broken down into three levels defined as follows:
1180145_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	As of June 30, 2018 , the Company believes that the carrying amounts of its other financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	See Note 4 for additional information.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	The preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P52_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates and these differences could be material.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	The Company has stock-based compensation plans, which include stock options, nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	Fair value of option awards is determined using option-pricing models, fair value of nonvested share awards with market conditions is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation, and fair value of nonvested share awards that vest based upon performance or service conditions is determined by the closing market price of the Company s stock on the date of grant.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P53_S2	Stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period for the awards expected to vest.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued amended revenue recognition guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	The guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods or services.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P54_S2	The guidance also requires expanded disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P54_S3	Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P54_S4	The Company has completed an adoption plan, which included a review of customer contracts, applying the five-step model of the new standard to the customer contracts and comparing the results to the Company s current accounting.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company s revenue recognition will remain largely unchanged given the majority of the Company s revenue arrangements consist of a single performance obligation that will be recognized at a point in time when control passes to the customer.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P55_S1	As a result, the Company does not anticipate a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	The Company is also implementing new internal controls around the judgments needed to address risks associated with applying the five-step model, which includes identifying performance obligations and judgments made related to variable consideration.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P56_S1	Effective July 1, 2018, the Company will be revising its revenue recognition accounting policy and disclosures to reflect the requirements of the amended revenue recognition guidance.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P56_S2	The Company will continue to monitor any modifications or interpretations communicated by the FASB that may impact any of its final assessments related to the guidance.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which revises the accounting requirements related to the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value.
1180145_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	The update also changes certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments.

1180145_18_ITEM15_P127_S0	(a) Examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrator s office and at other specified locations, such as worksites, all documents governing this Plan, including insurance contracts and collective bargaining agreements, if any, filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.
1180145_18_ITEM15_P128_S0	(b) Obtain, upon written request to the Plan Administrator, copies of documents governing the operation of this Plan, including insurance contracts and collective bargaining agreements, if any, and updated summary plan description.

1180145_18_ITEM15_P130_S0	In addition to creating rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the Plan.
1180145_18_ITEM15_P130_S1	The people who operate the Plan, called fiduciaries of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other plan participants and beneficiaries.
1180145_18_ITEM15_P130_S2	No one, including the Company or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA.
1180145_18_ITEM15_P131_S0	If your claim for a benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules.
1180145_18_ITEM15_P132_S0	Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights.
1180145_18_ITEM15_P132_S1	For instance, if you request a copy of documents and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a federal court.
1180145_18_ITEM15_P132_S2	In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator.
1180145_18_ITEM15_P133_S0	If you have a claim for benefits that is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court.
1180145_18_ITEM15_P133_S1	If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries do not administer the Plan in accordance with its terms, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court.
1180145_18_ITEM15_P133_S2	The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees.
1180145_18_ITEM15_P133_S3	If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees.
1180145_18_ITEM15_P133_S4	If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees; for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous.
1180145_18_ITEM15_P134_S0	If you have any questions about this Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator.
1180145_18_ITEM15_P134_S1	If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.
