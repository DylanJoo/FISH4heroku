24090_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	Citizens, Inc. is an insurance holding company serving the life insurance needs of individuals in the United States since 1969 and in over 34 countries around the world since 1975.
24090_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	Through our insurance subsidiaries, we pursue a strategy of offering traditional insurance products in niche markets where we believe we are able to achieve competitive advantages.
24090_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	We had approximately $1.0 billion of assets under management at December 31, 2010 and approximately $5.1 billion of insurance in force.
24090_11_ITEM1_P0_S3	Our core insurance operations include issuing and servicing:
24090_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	final expense and limited liability property policies to middle and lower income households in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi through employee and independent agents in our home service distribution channel.
24090_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	We were formed in 1969 by our Chairman, Harold E. Riley.
24090_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	Prior to our formation, Mr. Riley had many years of experience in the international and domestic life insurance business.
24090_11_ITEM1_P2_S2	Our Company has experienced significant growth through acquisitions in the domestic market and through market expansion in the international market.
24090_11_ITEM1_P2_S3	We capitalize on the experience of our management team in marketing and operations as we seek to generate bottom line return using knowledge of our niche markets and our well-established distribution channels.
24090_11_ITEM1_P2_S4	We believe our underwriting processes, policy terms, pricing practices and proprietary administrative systems enable us to be competitive in our current markets while protecting our shareholders and servicing our policyholders.
24090_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our business has grown, both internationally and domestically, in recent years.
24090_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	Revenues rose from $154.2 million in 2006 to $191.2 million in 2010.
24090_11_ITEM1_P3_S2	During the five years ended December 31, 2010, our assets grew from $711.1 million to $986.5 million.
24090_11_ITEM1_P3_S3	Total stockholders equity increased from $139.6 million at December 31, 2006 to $227.6 million at December 31, 2010.
24090_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	Selected Financial Data in this Report.
24090_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our business is comprised of three operating business segments, as detailed below.
24090_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our insurance operations are the primary focus of the Company as those segments generate the majority of our income.
24090_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for operating results of our segments for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
24090_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our Life Insurance segment consists of issuing ordinary whole life insurance domestically and in U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents.
24090_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	These contracts are designed to provide a fixed amount of insurance coverage over the life of the insured.
24090_11_ITEM1_P7_S2	Additionally, endowment contracts are issued by the Company, which are principally accumulation contracts that incorporate an element of life insurance protection.
24090_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	For the majority of our business, we retain only the first $100,000 of risk on any one life.
24090_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	We operate this segment through our subsidiaries: CICA Life Insurance Company of America ( CICA ), Citizens National Life Insurance Company, ( CNLIC ) and Integrity Capital Insurance Company ( ICIC ).
24090_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	We focus our sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies to high net worth, high income residents in Latin America and the Pacific Rim.
24090_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	We have successfully participated in the foreign marketplace since 1975, and we continue to seek opportunities for expansion of our foreign operations.
24090_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	We believe positive attributes of our international insurance business include:
24090_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	favorable persistency levels and mortality rates comparable to our U.S. policies.
24090_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	We have implemented several policies and procedures to reduce the risks of asset and premium loss relating to our international business.
24090_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	Approvals for policy issuance are made in our Austin, Texas office and policies are issued and delivered to our independent consultants, who deliver the policies to the insureds.
24090_11_ITEM1_P11_S2	We have no offices, employees or assets outside of the United States.
24090_11_ITEM1_P11_S3	Insurance policy applications and premium payments are submitted by the independent consultants or customers to us and we review the applications in our home offices in Austin, Texas.
24090_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	Premiums are paid in U.S. Dollars through a U.S. financial institution by check, wire or credit card.
24090_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	The policies we issue contain limitations on benefits for certain causes of death, such as homicide and careless driving.
24090_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	We have also developed disciplined underwriting criteria, which includes medical reviews of applicants as well as background and reference checks.
24090_11_ITEM1_P13_S2	In addition, we have a claims policy that requires investigation of substantially all death claims.
24090_11_ITEM1_P13_S3	Furthermore, we perform background reviews and reference checks of prospective marketing firms and consultants.
24090_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	Independent marketing firms and consultants specialize in marketing life insurance products and generally have several years of insurance marketing experience.
24090_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	We maintain standard contracts with the independent marketing firms pursuant to which they provide recruitment, training and supervision of their managers and associates in the service and placement of our products; however, all associates of these firms also contract directly with us as independent contractors and receive their compensation directly from us.
24090_11_ITEM1_P14_S2	Accordingly, should an arrangement between any independent marketing firm and us be terminated for any reason, we believe we would continue with the existing marketing arrangements with the associates of these firms without a material loss of sales.
24090_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our standard agreement with independent marketing firms and consultants provides they are independent contractors responsible for their own operation, expenses and that they are the representative of the prospective insured.
24090_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	In addition, the marketing firms also guarantee any debts of their associates to us.
24090_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	The marketing firms receive commissions on all new and renewal policies serviced or placed by them or their associates.
24090_11_ITEM1_P15_S3	All of these contracts provide that the independent marketing firms and consultants are aware of and responsible for compliance with local laws.
24090_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	The following table sets forth, by territory, our total percentages of direct collected premiums from our international life insurance business for the periods indicated.
24090_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	The information is presented in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed by the state of Colorado, the state of domicile of CICA, our subsidiary that writes all of our international business.
24090_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	The ordinary whole life policies issued to residents of foreign countries during 2010 had an average face amount of approximately $68,000.
24090_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	We offer several ordinary whole life insurance and endowment products designed to meet the needs of our non-U.S. policy owners.
24090_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	These policies have been structured to provide:
24090_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	lifetime income guarantees for an insured or for surviving beneficiaries.
24090_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our international products have living benefit features.
24090_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	Every policy contains guaranteed cash values and is participating (i.e., provides for cash dividend as apportioned by CICA s board of directors).
24090_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	The major portion of each premium payment is used to provide insurance protection and build guaranteed cash values, while a lesser portion is used for living benefit accumulation.
24090_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	Once a policy owner pays the annual premium and the policy is issued, we immediately pay a cash dividend to the owner.
24090_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	The policy owner has several options with regard to the dividend, including the right to assign dividends to our stock investment plan, registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act ), and administered in the United States by our unaffiliated transfer agent.
24090_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	The life insurance business is highly competitive.
24090_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	We compete with a large number of stock and mutual life companies internationally and domestically, as well as with financial institutions that offer insurance products.
24090_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	There are more than 1,000 life insurance companies in the United States, some of which also provide insurance to foreign residents.
24090_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	Given the variety of foreign markets in which we provide ordinary whole life insurance, it is not possible to ascertain our competitive position.
24090_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	We face competition primarily from companies formed and operated in the country in which the insureds reside, from companies that operate in the same manner as we do and from companies that are foreign to the countries in which policies are sold, but issue insurance policies denominated in the local currency of those countries.
24090_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	A substantial number of companies may be deemed to have a competitive advantage over us due to their significantly greater financial resources, histories of successful operations and larger marketing forces.
24090_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	We believe that our experience, combined with the special features of our policies, allow us to compete effectively in pursuing new business.
24090_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Because premiums on our international policies are paid in U.S. Dollars drawn on U.S. financial institutions, and we pay claims in U.S. Dollars, we provide a product that is different from the products provided by foreign-domiciled companies.
24090_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	Our international policies are usually acquired by significant net worth persons in the top income brackets of their respective countries.
24090_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	The policies sold by our local competitors are generally offered broadly and are priced using the mortality of the entire population of the geographic region.
24090_11_ITEM1_P26_S3	Our mortality charges are therefore typically lower, which provides a competitive advantage.
24090_11_ITEM1_P26_S4	Additionally, the assets backing the reserves for our local competitors policies must be substantially invested in their respective countries and, therefore, are exposed to the inflationary risks and social or economic crises that tend to impact their countries.
24090_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	In the midwest and the southern United States, we seek to serve middle income households through the sale of cash accumulation ordinary whole life insurance products.
24090_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	The majority of our inforce business results from blocks of business of insurance companies we have acquired over the past 15 years.
24090_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our distribution strategy is focused on attracting marketing consultants, comprised primarily of part-time, second-career sales associates (such as teachers, coaches, community leaders and others) in rural and urban areas, although we have seen an increased interest for our products from career distribution networks.
24090_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	In the United States, our domestic sales and marketing is conducted predominantly through independent marketing consultants.
24090_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	Over the past three years, new product sales have trended downward as we have tightened underwriting on business that did not meet our profitability objectives.
24090_11_ITEM1_P29_S2	Our transition strategy focuses on the introduction of our cash accumulation ordinary whole life products to independent marketing consultants associated with companies we have acquired, while continuing to service the needs of our policyholders.
24090_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	The following table sets forth our direct collected premiums by state for the periods indicated, in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed by the states of domicile of our insurance company subsidiaries.
24090_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	The 2009 increase in Indiana resulted from the acquisition of Integrity Capital Insurance Company ( ICIC ), which is domiciled in Indiana and had year-to-date premiums totaling approximately $1.6 million and $1.7 million in 2009 and 2010.
24090_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	The Company completed its acquisition of Integrity Capital Corporation ( ICC ) in exchange for 1,294,000 shares of Citizens, Inc.
24090_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	ICC is the parent of ICIC, an Indiana life insurance company that is included in the Life Insurance segment.
24090_11_ITEM1_P31_S3	The transaction was valued at $9.0 million when the transaction closed on February 27, 2009.
24090_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	A number of domestic life insurance companies we acquired had blocks of accident and health insurance policies, which we did not consider to be a core part of our business.
24090_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	We have ceded this business under a coinsurance agreement with an unaffiliated insurance company under which it assumes substantially all of our accident and health policies.
24090_11_ITEM1_P32_S2	The premium amounts ceded under the coinsurance agreement in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 were $5.3 million, $6.3 million and $7.5 million, respectively.
24090_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our domestic life insurance products focus primarily on living needs and provide benefits focused toward accumulating money for the policyowner.
24090_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	The features of our domestic life insurance products include:
24090_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	an option to waive premium payments in the event of disability.
24090_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	Our life insurance products are principally designed to address the insured s concern about outliving his or her monthly income, while at the same time providing death benefits.
24090_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	The primary purpose of our product portfolio is to help the insured create capital for needs such as retirement income, children s higher education funds, business opportunities, emergencies and health care needs.
24090_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	The U.S. life insurance industry is a mature industry that, in recent years, has experienced little to no growth.
24090_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	Competition is intense because the life insurance industry is consolidating, with larger, more efficient and more effective organizations emerging from consolidation.
24090_11_ITEM1_P36_S2	Additionally, legislation became effective in the United States in 2000 that permits commercial banks, insurance companies and investment banks to combine.
24090_11_ITEM1_P36_S3	These factors have increased competitive pressures in general.
24090_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	Many domestic life insurance companies have significantly greater financial, marketing forces and other resources, longer business histories and more diversified lines of insurance products than we do.
24090_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	We also face competition from companies marketing in person as well as with direct mail and Internet sales campaigns.
24090_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	Although we may be at a competitive disadvantage to these entities, we believe that our premium rates and policy features are generally competitive with those of other life insurance companies selling similar types of ordinary whole life insurance.
24090_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	We operate in the Home Service market through our subsidiaries Security Plan Life Insurance Company ( SPLIC ) and Security Plan Fire Insurance Company ( SPFIC ), and focus on the life insurance needs of the middle and lower income markets, primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	Our policies are sold and serviced through a home service marketing distribution system of approximately 330 employee-agents who work full time on a route system and through funeral homes to sell policies, collect premiums and service policyholders.
24090_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	The following table sets forth our direct collected premiums by state for the periods indicated, in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed by the states of domicile of our insurance company subsidiaries.
24090_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our home service insurance products consist primarily of small face amount ordinary whole life and pre-need policies, which are designed to fund final expenses for the insured, primarily consisting of funeral and burial costs.
24090_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	The average life insurance policy face amount issued was approximately $7,100 in 2010; therefore, the underwriting performed on these applications is limited.
24090_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	To a much lesser extent, our Home Service Insurance segment sells limited-liability, named peril property policies covering dwellings and contents.
24090_11_ITEM1_P41_S1	We provide $30,000 maximum coverage on any one dwelling and contents, while content only coverage and dwelling only coverage is limited to $20,000.
24090_11_ITEM1_P41_S2	We face competition in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas from other companies specializing in home service distribution of insurance.
24090_11_ITEM1_P41_S3	We seek to compete based upon our emphasis on personal service to our customers.
24090_11_ITEM1_P41_S4	We intend to continue premium growth within this segment via direct sales and acquisitions.
24090_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	The Company completed the acquisition of Ozark National Life Insurance Company ( ONLIC ) in October of 2008 for a purchase price of $8.0 million.
24090_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	This entity was merged into SPLIC as of December 31, 2009.
24090_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	Other Non-insurance Enterprises includes Computing Technology, Inc., which provides data processing services to the Company, and Insurance Investors, Inc., which provides aviation transportation to the Company.
24090_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	This segment also includes the results of Citizens, Inc., the parent Company.
24090_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	Revenues derived from any single customer did not exceed 10% of consolidated revenues in any of the last three years.
24090_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our administrative operations are conducted primarily at our executive offices in Austin, Texas through approximately 105 administrative, operating and underwriting personnel.
24090_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	Our Home Service operations are conducted to a large degree from our district offices in Louisiana and Arkansas, as well as our support center in Donaldsonville, Louisiana through approximately 64 operations personnel, and Little Rock, Arkansas through 2 personnel.
24090_11_ITEM1_P46_S2	At our executive offices, we perform policy design, marketing oversight, underwriting, accounting and reporting, customer service, administration and investing activities.
24090_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our senior management has significant experience in insurance company application system design and implementation.
24090_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	Since the mid-1960 s, our senior management has been leading development of evolving insurance applications.
24090_11_ITEM1_P47_S2	We have a single integrated system for our entire Company, which is a centrally-controlled, mainframe-based administrative system.
24090_11_ITEM1_P47_S3	Functions of our administrative system include policy set up, administration, billing and collections, commission calculation, valuation, automated internal audit functions, storage backup and other related functions.
24090_11_ITEM1_P47_S4	Each company we acquire is ultimately converted onto our administrative system.
24090_11_ITEM1_P47_S5	This system has been in place for many years, and we believe it is a significant asset to us.
24090_11_ITEM1_P47_S6	We update our administrative system on an ongoing basis.
24090_11_ITEM1_P47_S7	This system is also capable of significant expansion without substantial capital outlay or increase in staff.
24090_11_ITEM1_P47_S8	Therefore, we believe we can achieve additional growth without costly administrative system expenditures, delays, failures or the addition of substantial staffing.
24090_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our U.S. insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations.
24090_11_ITEM1_P48_S1	State insurance laws establish supervisory agencies with broad regulatory authority to regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of each state in which they are licensed.
24090_11_ITEM1_P48_S2	In addition, U.S. laws, such as the USA Patriot Act of 2001, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the recently enacted Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( the Dodd-Frank Act ), are examples of U.S. regulation that affect our business.
24090_11_ITEM1_P48_S3	We are subject to comprehensive regulations under the USA Patriot Act with respect to money laundering, as well as federal regulations regarding privacy and confidentiality.
24090_11_ITEM1_P48_S4	Our insurance products and thus our businesses also are affected by U.S. federal, state and local tax laws.
24090_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act focuses on financial reform and may result in significant changes to the regulation of institutions operating in the financial services industry, including the Company.
24090_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	Legislative or regulatory requirements imposed by or promulgated in connection with this Act may make it more expensive for the Company to conduct its business, may have a material adverse effect on the overall business climate and could materially affect the profitability of the results of operations and financial condition of financial institutions.
24090_11_ITEM1_P49_S2	The Company is uncertain as to all of the impacts this new legislation will have and cannot provide assurance it will not adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1_P49_S3	In general, government regulation at the federal level may increase and may result in unpredictable consequences for the Company.
24090_11_ITEM1_P49_S4	In addition, other federal laws and regulations apply to us in areas such as pension regulations, privacy, tort reform and taxation.
24090_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	The purpose of the laws and regulations that affect our insurance business is primarily to protect our insureds and not our stockholders.
24090_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations.
24090_11_ITEM1_P50_S2	In addition, insurance regulatory authorities (including state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general) periodically make inquiries and regularly conduct examinations regarding compliance by us and our subsidiaries with insurance, and other laws and regulations regarding the conduct of our insurance businesses.
24090_11_ITEM1_P50_S3	We cooperate with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action when warranted.
24090_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are collectively licensed to transact business in 33 states.
24090_11_ITEM1_P51_S1	We have insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the states of Colorado, Louisiana, Indiana and Texas.
24090_11_ITEM1_P51_S2	Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are licensed and regulated in all U.S. jurisdictions in which they conduct insurance business.
24090_11_ITEM1_P51_S3	The extent of this regulation varies, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing the financial condition of insurers, including standards of solvency, types and concentration of investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, credit for reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy, and the business conduct of insurers, including marketing and sales practices and claims handling.
24090_11_ITEM1_P51_S4	In addition, statutes and regulations usually require the licensing of insurers and their agents, the approval of policy forms and related materials and the approval of rates for certain types of insurance products.
24090_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	All U.S. jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries conduct insurance business have enacted legislation that requires each U.S. insurance company in a holding company system, except captive insurance companies, to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its jurisdiction of domicile and to furnish that regulatory authority financial and other information concerning the operations of, and the interrelationships and transactions among, companies within its holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system.
24090_11_ITEM1_P52_S1	These laws and regulations also regulate transactions between insurance companies and their parents and affiliates.
24090_11_ITEM1_P52_S2	Generally, these laws and regulations require that all transactions within a holding company system between an insurer and its affiliates be fair and reasonable and that the insurer s statutory capital and surplus following any transaction with an affiliate be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.
24090_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	Statutory surplus is the excess of admitted assets over the sum of statutory liabilities and capital.
24090_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	For certain types of agreements and transactions between an insurer and its affiliates, these laws and regulations require prior notification to, and non-disapproval or approval by, the insurance regulatory authority of the insurer s jurisdiction of domicile.
24090_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	The payment of dividends or other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by the insurance laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile.
24090_11_ITEM1_P54_S1	The laws and regulations of some of these jurisdictions also prohibit an insurer from declaring or paying a dividend except out of its earned surplus or require the insurer to obtain regulatory approval before it may do so.
24090_11_ITEM1_P54_S2	In addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employee or other services) if they determine such payment could be adverse to policyholders or insurance contract holders of the subsidiary.
24090_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled require that a controlling party obtain the approval of the insurance commissioner of the insurance company s jurisdiction of domicile prior to acquiring control of the insurer and may delay, deter or prevent a transaction our shareholders might consider desirable.
24090_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	Risk-based capital ( RBC ) requirements are imposed on life and property and casualty insurance companies.
24090_11_ITEM1_P56_S1	The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) has established minimum capital requirements in the form of Risk-Based Capital ( RBC ).
24090_11_ITEM1_P56_S2	Risk-based capital factors the type of business written by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company s business to develop a minimum level of capital called authorized control level risk-based capital and compares this level to adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves.
24090_11_ITEM1_P56_S3	Should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk-based capital fall below 200%, a series of actions by the affected company would begin.
24090_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	Two of our subsidiaries fell below the minimum RBC threshold at December 31, 2008.
24090_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	A capital contribution of $1.0 million was made to SPFIC during the first quarter of 2009.
24090_11_ITEM1_P57_S2	An additional $1.0 million capital contribution was made to SPFIC in the third quarter of 2009.
24090_11_ITEM1_P57_S3	A capital contribution of $1.0 million was also made to Ozark National Life Insurance Company ( ONLIC ) during the first quarter of 2009 due to its RBC ratio falling below 200% at December 31, 2008.
24090_11_ITEM1_P57_S4	The decline in SPFIC s capital balance mainly resulted from hurricane losses in 2008 and an increase in operating expenses.
24090_11_ITEM1_P57_S5	The reduction in ONLIC s capital balance resulted from declines in asset values of preferred and common stock holdings.
24090_11_ITEM1_P57_S6	These capital contributions increased the RBC ratios and RBC action plans were submitted to the relevant insurance departments.
24090_11_ITEM1_P57_S7	The capital balance of ONLIC was determined to be at company action level at March 31, 2009 due to continued declines relative to its investment holdings.
24090_11_ITEM1_P57_S8	The capital contributions made in 2009 increased the ratios as anticipated in action plans submitted to the appropriate state insurance departments.
24090_11_ITEM1_P57_S9	The Company received approval from the respective state insurance departments to merge ONLIC into SPLIC as of October 1, 2009.
24090_11_ITEM1_P57_S10	The capital contributions did not impact the overall consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.
24090_11_ITEM1_P57_S11	All insurance subsidiaries were above the RBC minimums at December 31, 2010.
24090_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	Effective September 1, 2010, CICA contributed 150,000 shares of Citizens, Inc.
24090_11_ITEM1_P58_S1	Class A common stock, valued at $1,032,000, to CNLIC as a capital contribution due to surplus issues that arose in Florida and Mississippi where CNLIC was deficient by approximately $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
24090_11_ITEM1_P58_S2	The contribution corrected the deficiencies in both states.
24090_11_ITEM1_P58_S3	The transaction has been eliminated under consolidation accounting rules.
24090_11_ITEM1_P58_S4	Life premiums collected in 2010 were $1,200 and $8,000, and in 2009 were $2,000 and $9,800 relating exclusively to policy renewals in Florida and Mississippi, respectively.
24090_11_ITEM1_P58_S5	Management is currently evaluating CNLIC s operations and strategy for the future, but does not anticipate any material change relative to the consolidated financial condition of the Company.
24090_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	Effective with the annual reporting period ending December 31, 2010, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or the NAIC, adopted revisions to the Annual Financial Reporting Model Regulation, or the Model Audit Rule, related to auditor independence, corporate governance and internal control over financial reporting.
24090_11_ITEM1_P59_S1	The adopted revisions require that we file reports with state insurance departments regarding our assessment of internal control over financial reporting.
24090_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	In late 2009, the NAIC issued Statement of Statutory Accounting Principles ( SSAP ) 10R. SSAP 10R increased the amount of deferred tax assets that may be admitted on a statutory basis.
24090_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	The admission criteria for realizing the value of deferred tax assets was increased from a one year to a three year period.
24090_11_ITEM1_P60_S2	Further, the aggregate cap on deferred tax assets that may be admitted was increased from 10% to 15% of surplus.
24090_11_ITEM1_P60_S3	These changes increased the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries, thereby positively impacting RBC at December 31, 2009 and 2010.
24090_11_ITEM1_P60_S4	To temper this positive RBC impact, and as a temporary measure at December 31, 2009 and 2010, a 5% pre-tax RBC charge must be applied to the additional admitted deferred tax assets generated by SSAP 10R.
24090_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	Government actions in response to the recent financial crisis and market volatility could significantly impact our current regulations.
24090_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	As part of a comprehensive reform of financial services regulation known as H.R. 3173, Congress is considering the creation of an office within the federal government to collect information about the insurance industry, recommend standards, and represent the United States in dealing with foreign insurance regulators.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investing in our Company involves certain risks.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Set forth below are certain risks with respect to our Company.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Readers should carefully review these risks, together with the other information contained in this report.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties we have described in this report are not the only ones we face.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem not material, may also adversely affect our business.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Any of the risks discussed in this report or that are presently unknown or not material, if they were to actually occur, could result in a significant adverse impact on our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P1_S3	References in the risk factors below to we, us, our, Citizens and like terms relate to Citizens, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statement basis, unless specifically identified otherwise.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P1_S4	We operate our subsidiaries as separate and distinct entities with respect to corporate formalities.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	A substantial amount of our revenue comes from foreign residents and is subject to risks associated with foreign insurance laws, political instability and asset transfer restrictions.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	A substantial part of our insurance policy sales are from foreign countries, primarily those in Latin America and the Pacific Rim.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	There is a risk that we may lose a significant portion of these sales should adverse events occur in these countries.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We seek to address this risk by, among other things, not accepting insurance applications outside of the U.S., maintaining all of our assets are in the U.S. and requiring all policy premiums must be paid to us in U.S. Dollars drawn on U.S. financial institutions.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Accordingly, we have never qualified to do business in any foreign country and have never submitted our insurance policies issued to foreign residents for review by any insurance regulatory agency.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P3_S4	We sell our policies to foreign residents using foreign independent marketing firms and independent consultants, and we rely on those persons to comply with applicable laws in marketing our insurance products.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The government of a foreign country could determine that its residents may not buy life insurance from us unless we became qualified to do business in that country or unless our policies purchased by its residents receive prior approval from its insurance regulators.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Also, new laws or regulations could be implemented or new applications of existing laws or regulations could occur, which could result in the cessation of marketing activities by our independent marketing firms and consultants.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Further, there is no assurance that we would be able to qualify to do business in any foreign country or that its insurance regulatory authorities would approve our policies.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We could also face sanctions, including fines and penalties, if a country s authorities determined any failure to qualify or otherwise comply with its laws was willful or ongoing.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Any of the foregoing could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Additionally, we do not determine whether our independent consultants are required to be licensed to sell insurance in the countries in which they market our policies.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P4_S6	If our independent consultants were not in compliance with applicable laws, including licensing laws, they could be required to cease operations, which would reduce our revenues.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P4_S7	We have not obtained any advice of counsel in any foreign jurisdictions with respect to these matters.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P4_S8	We are unable to quantify the effect of foreign regulation on our business if regulation were to be imposed on us, but we believe we could expend substantial amounts of time and incur substantial expense in complying with any foreign regulation, and we may decide to withdraw from or avoid a market if foreign regulation were imposed.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P4_S9	From time to time we have become aware of new foreign laws, regulations or new interpretations of foreign laws or regulations that may have an adverse effect on the marketing efforts of our foreign independent marketing firms and consultants.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P4_S10	We cannot assure you that any of these laws, regulations, or application of them by foreign regulatory authorities will not have an adverse effect on the marketing efforts of our independent marketing firms and consultants and, in turn, on our revenues.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Additionally, if economic or political crises were to occur in any of the countries where our foreign policyowners reside, our revenues could be adversely affected.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Also, currency control laws, regulations and decrees in foreign countries, if implemented, could materially adversely affect our revenues by imposing restrictions on asset transfers outside of a country where our insureds reside.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	While our management has more than 40 years of experience in writing life insurance policies for foreign residents without any significant legal prohibition, regulatory action, or any lengthy currency controls relating to our foreign resident insureds, there can be no assurance that such situations will not occur and that our revenues, results of operations and financial condition will not be materially, adversely affected if they do occur.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The majority of our foreign policyholders choose to invest their policy dividends or other cash benefits in our Class A common stock through the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan (the Plan ).
24090_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If a securities regulatory authority were to deem the Plan s operation contrary to applicable securities laws, we risk facing fines and penalties and cease and desist orders which would create a reduction in the amount of Class A common stock purchased on the open market through the Plan.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The offer and sale of our Class A common stock through the Plan is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, but not under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Most all of our foreign policyholders participate in the Plan and choose to invest dividends paid on their insurance policies in our Class A common stock pursuant to the Plan.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We have not obtained any advice of counsel in any foreign jurisdiction as to whether such participation by foreign residents in the Plan is subject to foreign securities laws or regulations or whether our independent consultants in these jurisdictions are subject to licensing requirements in connection with foreign policyholder participation in the Plan.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If a foreign securities regulatory authority were to determine the offer and sale of our Class A common stock under the Plan were contrary to applicable laws and regulations of its jurisdiction, we could be faced with cease and desist orders, fines and penalties, or reduced participation in the Plan by our foreign policyholders.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P8_S4	This also could materially reduce the amount of our Class A common stock purchased and sold in the open market under the Plan, as historically a significant volume of shares have been purchased under the Plan through issuance of policy cash dividends assigned to the Plan.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P8_S5	We could also be faced with private disputes relating to the Plan, including the possibility of securities law claims within the United States.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P8_S6	In the absence of countervailing considerations, we would expect to defend any such claims and we could incur significant defense costs, including not only attorneys fees and other direct litigation costs, but also the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P8_S7	This could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	As an insurance holding company with significant investment exposure, we face material financial and capital markets risk in our operations.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Due to the low interest rate environment over the past several years, we experienced significant call activity on our fixed income portfolio which has decreased our investment yields compared to prior years.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Also, we recorded other-than-temporary impairments ( OTTI ) in 2008 and 2009 due to market declines and credit decline.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We recognized realized gains due to market appreciation on a significant number of these previously impaired securities that were disposed of in 2009 and 2010.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P9_S4	In addition, the significant increase in worldwide economic instability and unemployment rates could result in decreased persistency of our insurance policies in force, as well as reduced new insurance policy sales, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Changes in market interest rates may significantly affect our profitability.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Some of our products, principally traditional whole life insurance with annuity riders, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our spread, or the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under our contracts to policyholders and the rate of return we are able to earn on our investments intended to support obligations under the contracts.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our spread is a key component of our net income.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured, prepaid, been sold, or called at lower yields, reducing our investment margin.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our fixed income bond portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk as a significant portion of the portfolio is callable.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Lowering interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in investment margins on some of our products.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	However, our ability to lower these rates could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates, and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Our expectation of future spreads is an important component in amortization of deferred acquisition costs and significantly lower spreads may result in increasing amortization, thereby reducing net income for the period.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our investment portfolio is subject to various risks that may result in realized investment losses.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In particular, decreases in the fair value of fixed maturities may significantly reduce the value of our investments, and as a result, our financial condition may suffer.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations under these securities could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in the recognition of investment losses.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the bonds included in our portfolio and by other factors that may result in the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In particular, at December 31, 2010, fixed maturities represented $656 million or 84.6% of our total investments of $775 million.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The fair value of fixed maturities and the related investment income fluctuates depending on general economic and market conditions.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The fair value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us will generally increase or decrease in line with changes in market interest rates.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P18_S3	An investment has prepayment risk when there is a risk that the timing of cash flows that result from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P18_S4	We experienced significant prepayments of bonds in our investment portfolio in 2010 and 2009.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The impact of value fluctuations affects our consolidated financial statements.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Because all of our fixed maturities are classified as available for sale, changes in the fair value of our securities are reflected in our stockholders equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss).
24090_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	No similar adjustment is made for liabilities to reflect a change in interest rates.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Therefore, interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect our stockholders equity, total comprehensive income and/or cash flows.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	For mortgage-backed securities, credit risk exists if mortgagees default on the underlying mortgages.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Although at December 31, 2010, approximately 74.4% of our fixed maturities were investment grade and continue to be rated AA or above, all of our fixed maturities are subject to credit risk.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If any of the issuers of our fixed maturities suffer financial setbacks, the ratings on the fixed maturities could fall (with a concurrent fall in fair value) and, in a worst case scenario, the issuer could default on its financial obligations.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P20_S3	If the issuer defaults, we could have realized losses associated with the impairment of the securities.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	A substantial portion of our investment portfolio is concentrated in U.S. Government sponsored corporations and agencies.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	At December 31, 2010 we had investments of $378 million (48.7% of our total investment portfolio) in U.S. Government sponsored corporations and agencies, including the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie ) and the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie ).
24090_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Both Freddie and Fannie are currently in conservatorship and the federal government is considering proposals to phase them out, or allow them to continue as private corporations, among other things.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If they are wound down, it is not clear how investments sponsored by them might be affected; however, the direct and indirect impact on our investment portfolio could be material and could be adverse.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities may be realized or result in future impairments, resulting in a reduction in our net income.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and are, therefore, excluded from our net income.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Our total gross unrealized losses on our available-for-sale securities portfolio at December 31, 2010 were $13.7 million.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P24_S3	The accumulated change in estimated fair value of these securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is realized upon sale of the security or in the event that the decline in estimated fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary and an impairment charge to earnings is taken.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Realized losses or impairments may have a material adverse effect on our net income in a particular quarterly or annual period.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims and we may be required to establish additional reserves, which in turn may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We maintain reserves to cover our estimated exposure for claims relating to our issued insurance policies.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Reserves, whether calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) or statutory accounting practices prescribed by various state insurance regulators, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections, of what we expect claims will be based on mortality assumptions that are determined by various regulatory authorities.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Many reserve assumptions are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In addition, when we acquire other domestic life insurance companies, our assessment of the adequacy of acquired policy liabilities is subject to our estimates and assumptions.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops, and adjustments to reserves are reflected in our statements of operations for the period in which such estimates are updated.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, future developments may require us to increase claims reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the periods in which such increases occur.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the costs of customer relationships acquired, which would increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	At December 31, 2010, we had $125.7 million of deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	DAC represents costs that vary with and are primarily related to the sale and issuance of our insurance policies and are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	These costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions, solicitation and printing costs, sales material costs and some support costs, such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Under U.S. GAAP, DAC is amortized to income over the lives of the underlying policies, in relation to the anticipated recognition of premiums.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In addition, when we acquire a block of insurance policies, we assign a portion of the purchase price to the right to receive future net cash flows from existing insurance and investment contracts and policies.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	This intangible asset, called the cost of customer relationships acquired, or CCRA, represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	At December 31, 2010, we had $31.6 million of CCRA.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P30_S3	We amortize the value of this intangible asset in a manner similar to the amortization of DAC.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our amortization of DAC and CCRA generally depends upon anticipated profits from investments, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, persistency and maintenance expense margins.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	For example, if our insurance policy lapse and surrender rates were to exceed the assumptions upon which we priced our insurance policies, or if actual persistency proves to be less than our persistency assumptions, especially in the early years of a policy, we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We regularly review the quality of our DAC and CCRA to determine if they are recoverable from future income.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	If these costs are not recoverable, they are charged to expenses in the financial period in which we make this determination.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses, investment returns, surrender and other policy changes, mortality, morbidity, lapses or persistency may cause us to increase the amortization of DAC or CCRA, or both, or to record a current period expense to increase benefit reserves, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We may be required to recognize an impairment on the value of our goodwill, which would increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the amount paid by us to acquire various life insurance companies over the fair value of their net assets at the date of the acquisition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Under U.S. GAAP, we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level, which is either an operating segment or a business that is one level below the operating segment.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Goodwill is impaired if its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P36_S2	This may occur for various reasons, including changes in actual or expected earnings or cash flows of a reporting unit, generation of earnings by a reporting unit at a lower rate than similar businesses or declines in market prices for publicly traded businesses similar to our reporting units.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P36_S3	If any portion of our goodwill becomes impaired, we would be required to recognize the amount of the impairment as a current-period expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Goodwill in our consolidated financial statements was $17,160,000 as of December 31, 2009 and 2010.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We are a defendant in lawsuits, which may adversely affect our financial condition and detract from the time our management is able to devote to our business, and we are subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory matters.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We are a defendant in a lawsuit originally filed on August 6, 1999 in the Texas District Court, Austin, Texas, now styled Delia Bolanos Andrade, et al., Plaintiffs, v. Citizens Insurance Company of America, et al. , in which a class was originally certified by the trial court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Third District of Texas.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We appealed the grant of class status to the Texas Supreme Court, which on March 2, 2007, reversed the Court of Appeal s affirmation of the trial court s class certification order, decertified the class and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the Texas Supreme Court s opinion.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The underlying lawsuit alleged that certain life insurance policies we made available to non-U.S. residents, when combined with a policy feature that allowed certain cash benefits to be assigned to two non-U.S. trusts for the purpose of accumulating ownership of our Class A common stock, along with allowing the policyholders to make additional contributions to the trusts, were actually offers and sales of securities that occurred in Texas by unregistered dealers in violation of the Texas securities laws.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The remedy sought was rescission and return of the insurance premium payments.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	On November 16, 2009, the trial court conducted further proceedings on the case, in order to determine whether the class should be recertified.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	On December 9, 2009, the trial court denied the recertification of the class.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P40_S2	The remaining plaintiffs must now proceed individually, and not as a class, if they intend to pursue their cases against Citizens.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Citizens intends to maintain a vigorous defense in any remaining proceedings.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In addition to these lawsuits, we may from time to time be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations, including, but not limited to, other possible disputes relating to the non-U.S. trusts or the Plan referred to above and the investment by many of our foreign policyholders in our Class A common stock of certain cash benefits they receive from their insurance policies.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If allegations similar to those made in certain of these lawsuits regarding the application of Texas or other securities laws to the assignment of policy benefits were determined to be valid, we could face the possibility of other securities law claims within the United States.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Also, we could be faced with contingent liabilities with respect to possible claims for violations of securities laws, the extent of which would be difficult to determine.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P41_S3	In the absence of countervailing considerations, we would expect to defend any such claims, and we could incur significant defense costs, including not only attorneys fees and other direct litigation costs, but also the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P41_S4	This could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Reinsurers with which we do business could increase their premium rates and may not honor their obligations, leaving us liable for the reinsured coverage.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We reinsure certain risks underwritten by our various insurance subsidiaries.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P43_S2	The high cost of reinsurance or lack of affordable coverage could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities and, even if highly desirable or necessary, we may not be able to obtain replacement reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts or at rates economic to us.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P44_S2	If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling or unable to bear an increase in net exposures, we may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P44_S3	In addition, our reinsurance facilities may be cancelled, pursuant to their terms, upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including a change of control of our Company (generally defined as the acquisition of 10% or more of our voting equity securities) or the failure of our insurance company subsidiaries to maintain the minimum required levels of statutory surplus.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Any of these potential developments could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	In 2010, we reinsured $381 million of face amount of our life insurance policies.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Amounts reinsured in 2010 represented 8.6% of the face amount of direct life insurance in force in that year.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Although the cost of reinsurance is, in some cases, reflected in premium rates, under certain reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer may increase the rate it charges us for reinsurance.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P46_S1	If our cost of reinsurance were to increase, we might not be able to recover these increased costs, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P46_S2	See Note 5 to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We may not be able to continue our past strategy of acquiring other U.S. life insurance companies, and we may not realize improvements to our financial results as a result of our past or any future acquisitions.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We have acquired 16 U.S. life insurance companies since 1987.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our objective in this strategy has been to increase our assets, revenues and capital, improve our competitive position and increase our earnings, in part by realizing certain operating efficiencies associated with economies of scale.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We evaluate possible acquisitions of other insurance companies on an ongoing basis.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	While our business model is not dependent primarily upon acquisitions, the time frame for achieving or further improving our market positions can be shortened through acquisitions.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P49_S2	There can be no assurance that suitable acquisitions presenting opportunities for continued growth and operating efficiencies will be available to us, or that we will realize the anticipated financial results from completed acquisitions.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P49_S3	In addition, we face intense competition in seeking to make acquisitions, much of which is from companies with greater financial and human resources than we have.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Even if we identify and complete insurance company acquisitions, we may be unable to integrate them on an economically favorable basis.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Implementation of an acquisition strategy entails a number of risks, including, among others, inaccurate assessment of assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities and the failure to achieve anticipated operating efficiencies, revenues, earnings or cash flow.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Our international and domestic operations face significant competition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our international marketing plan focuses on making available U.S. Dollar-denominated life insurance products to high net worth, high income individuals residing in more than 30 countries.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P53_S1	New competition could increase the supply of available insurance, which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive profitable rates to us, thereby adversely affecting our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Although there are some impediments facing potential competitors that wish to enter the foreign markets we serve, the entry of new competitors into these markets may occur, affording our customers reason to change to other insurance providers.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P53_S3	In connection with our business with foreign nationals, we experience competition primarily from the following sources, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have:
24090_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Foreign operated companies with U.S. Dollar policies.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We face direct competition from companies that operate in the same manner as we operate in our international markets.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Companies foreign to the countries in which their policies are sold but that issue local currency policies.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Another group of our competitors in the international marketplace consists of companies that are foreign to the countries in which their policies are sold but issue life insurance policies denominated in the local currencies of those countries.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Local currency policies provide the benefit of assets located in the country of foreign residents, but entail risks of uncertainty due to local currency fluctuations, as well as the perceived instability and weakness of local currencies.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Locally operated companies with local currency policies.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P58_S1	We compete with companies formed and operated in the country in which our foreign insureds reside.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Generally, these companies are subject to risks of currency fluctuations, and they primarily use mortality tables based on experience of the local population as a whole.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P58_S3	These mortality tables are typically based on significantly shorter life spans than those we use.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P58_S4	As a result, the cost of insurance from these companies tends to be higher than ours.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P58_S5	Although these companies typically market their policies to a broader section of the population than do our independent marketing firms and independent consultants, there can be no assurance that these companies will not endeavor to place a greater emphasis on our target market and compete more directly with us.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	In the United States, we compete with more than 1,000 other life insurance companies of various sizes.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The life insurance business in the United States is highly competitive, in part because it is a mature industry that, in recent years, has experienced little to no growth in life insurance sales.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Many domestic life insurance companies have substantially greater financial resources, longer business histories and more diversified lines of insurance coverage than we do.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P60_S2	These companies also have larger sales forces than we have.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Competition in the United States has also increased recently because the life insurance industry is consolidating, with larger, more efficient organizations emerging from the consolidation.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P60_S4	In addition, legislation became effective in 2000 that permits commercial banks, insurance companies and investment banks to combine.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P60_S5	This legislation permits, for instance, a commercial bank to acquire or form an insurance company.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P60_S6	We believe these factors have increased competitive pressures in the life insurance market in general.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	In addition, from time to time, companies enter and exit the markets in which we operate, thereby increasing competition at times when there are new entrants.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P61_S1	We may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices, or for other reasons.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in any of our markets.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P62_S1	If we do not, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Sales of our products may be reduced if we are unable to (i) establish and maintain commercial relationships with independent marketing firms and independent consultants (ii) attract and retain employee agents or (iii) develop and maintain our distribution sources.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We distribute our insurance products through several distribution channels, including independent marketing firms and independent consultants and our employee agents.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P64_S1	These relationships are significant for both our revenues and our profits.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P64_S2	In our life insurance segment, we depend almost exclusively on the services of independent marketing firms and independent consultants.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P64_S3	In our home service insurance segment, we depend on employee agents whose role in our distribution process is integral to developing and maintaining relationships with policyholders.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Significant competition exists among insurers in attracting and maintaining marketers of demonstrated ability.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Some of our competitors may offer better compensation packages for marketing firms, independent consultants and agents and broader arrays of products and have a greater diversity of distribution resources, better brand recognition, more competitive pricing, lower cost structures and greater financial strength or claims paying ratings than we do.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P65_S2	We compete with other insurers for marketing firms, independent consultants and employee agents primarily on the basis of our compensation and support services.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Any reduction in our ability to attract and retain effective sales representatives could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Loss of the services of our senior management team would likely hinder development of our operating and marketing programs and our strategy for expanding our business.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We rely on the active participation of our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Harold E. Riley (age 82), and our Vice Chairman of the Board and President, Rick D. Riley (age 57), in connection with the development and execution of our operating and marketing plans and strategy for expanding our business.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P67_S1	We anticipate that their expertise will continue to be of substantial value in connection with our operations.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P67_S2	The loss of the services of either of these individuals could have a significant adverse effect on our business and prospects.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P67_S3	We do not have an employment agreement with either of these persons nor do we carry a key-man insurance policy on either of their lives.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the United States, which increases our costs of doing business and could restrict the conduct of our business.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in U.S. jurisdictions wherein we do business, as well as anti-money laundering regulations adopted under the USA Patriot Act.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Insurance company regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, with substantially lesser protections to shareholders of the regulated insurance companies.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P70_S1	To that end, all the states in which we do business have insurance regulatory agencies with broad powers under law with respect to such things as: licensing companies to transact business; mandating capital and surplus requirements; regulating trade and claims practices; approving policy forms; and restricting companies ability to enter and exit markets.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The capacity for an insurance company s growth in premiums is partially a function of its required statutory surplus.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus, as measured by statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by a company s state of domicile, is considered important by all state insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Failure to maintain required levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action by regulatory authorities.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Most insurance regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant, renew, suspend and revoke licenses and approvals, and could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities, including acquisitions of other insurance companies, require us to add capital to our insurance company subsidiaries, or fine us.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P72_S1	If we are unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, or if our insurance business is determined not to comply fully with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations and their interpretations, including the USA Patriot Act, our revenues, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Although the U.S. federal government has not historically regulated the insurance business, the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, expands the federal presence in insurance oversight.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P73_S1	The Act s requirements include streamlining the state-based regulation of reinsurance and non-admitted insurance (also known as surplus lines insurance, which is property or casualty insurance written by a company that is not licensed to sell policies of insurance in a given state).
24090_11_ITEM1A_P73_S2	This legislation also establishes a new Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury with powers over all lines of insurance except health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P73_S3	The Federal Insurance Office is authorized to, among other things, gather data and information to monitor aspects of the insurance industry, identify issues in the regulation of insurers about insurance matters and preempt state insurance measures under certain circumstances.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P74_S0	As this Act calls for numerous studies and contemplates further regulation, the future impact of the Act on our results of operations or our financial condition cannot be determined at this time.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Changes in U.S. regulation may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and limit our prospective growth.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Currently, the U.S. Federal Government does not directly regulate the insurance business, although initiatives for Federal regulation of insurance are proposed by members of the U.S. Congress from time to time.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P76_S1	However, Federal legislation and administrative policies in several other areas can materially and adversely affect insurance companies, including our business.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P76_S2	These areas include the USA Patriot Act, financial services regulation, securities regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P76_S3	In addition, various forms of direct federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Our failure to maintain effective information systems could adversely affect our business.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We must maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop new information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P78_S1	If we do not maintain adequate systems, we could experience adverse consequences, including products acquired through acquisition, inadequate information on which to base pricing, underwriting and reserve decisions, regulatory problems, failure to meet prompt payment obligations, increases in administrative expenses and loss of customers.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Some of our information technology systems and software are mainframe-based, legacy-type systems that require an ongoing commitment of resources to maintain current standards.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P79_S1	We continuously enhance and update our systems in seeking to keep pace with changes in our products and business models, information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and policyholder needs.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Our success is dependent, among other things, on maintaining and enhancing the effectiveness of existing systems, as well as continuing to integrate, develop and enhance our information systems to support business processes in a cost-effective manner.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our failure to protect confidential information and privacy could result in the loss of customers, subject us to fines and penalties and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to privacy regulations and to confidentiality obligations.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P82_S1	We also have legal obligations to protect certain confidential information we obtain from our customers and vendors.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Obligations to protect vendors generally include protecting confidential information in the same manner and to the same extent as we protect our own confidential information.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P82_S3	The actions we take to protect confidential information include among other things: monitoring our record retention plans and policies and any changes in state or federal privacy and compliance requirements; maintaining secure storage facilities for tangible records; and limiting access to electronic information in order to safeguard certain information.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P83_S0	In addition, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires that we deliver a notice regarding our privacy policy both at the delivery of an insurance policy and annually thereafter.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Certain exceptions are allowed for sharing of information under joint marketing agreements.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P84_S1	However, certain state laws may require us to obtain a policyholder s consent before we share information.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We have a written information security program with appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect such confidential information.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P85_S1	If we do not comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information, we could experience adverse consequences, including regulatory sanctions, loss of reputation and litigation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P86_S0	The insurance industry in which we operate may be subject to periodic negative publicity, which may negatively impact our financial results.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We interface with and distribute our products to individual consumers.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P87_S1	There may be a perception that these purchasers may be unsophisticated and in need of consumer protection.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P87_S2	Accordingly, from time to time, consumer advocate groups or the media may focus attention on our products, thereby subjecting the insurance industry to periodic negative publicity.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P87_S3	We may also be negatively impacted if other insurance companies engage in practices resulting in increased public attention to our businesses.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P87_S4	Negative publicity may result in lower sales of insurance, lower persistency of our insurance products, increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation, which may further increase our costs of doing business and impede our ability to market our products.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P87_S5	As a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P88_S0	General economic, financial market and political conditions may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected from time to time by general economic, financial market and political conditions, both in the United States and in the foreign countries where our policyowners reside.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P89_S1	These conditions include economic cycles such as: levels of consumer spending; levels of inflation; movements of the financial markets; availability of credit; fluctuations in interest rates, monetary policy or demographics; and legislative and competitive changes.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P90_S0	During periods of economic downturn, such as the one that occurred in 2008 and 2009, our insureds may choose not to purchase our insurance products, may terminate existing policies, permit policies to lapse or may choose to reduce the amount of coverage purchased, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P90_S1	Also, our sales of new insurance policies might decrease.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by applicable laws and regulations in the amounts of fees, dividends and other distributions they may make to us.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P91_S1	The inability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us in sufficient amounts for us to conduct our operations could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations or expand our business.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P92_S0	As a holding company, our principal asset is the stock of our subsidiaries.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P92_S1	We rely primarily on statutorily permissible payments from our insurance company subsidiaries, principally through service agreements we have with our subsidiaries, to meet our working capital and other corporate expenses.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P92_S2	The ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to make payments to us is subject to regulation by the states in which they are domiciled, and these payments depend primarily on approved service agreements between us and these subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, the statutory surplus (which is the excess of assets over liabilities as determined under statutory accounting practices prescribed by an insurance company s state of domicile), future statutory earnings (which are earnings as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices) and regulatory restrictions.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Generally, the net assets of our insurance company subsidiaries available for dividends are limited to either the lesser or greater (depending on the state of domicile) of the subsidiary s net gain from operations during the preceding year and 10% of the subsidiary s net statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Except to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of our subsidiaries creditors, including policyholders, have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors and shareholders.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P94_S1	If any of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates or otherwise reorganizes, our creditors and shareholders will have no right to proceed in their own right against the assets of that subsidiary or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of the subsidiary under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to debt and equity capital and our cost of capital in seeking to expand our business.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P96_S0	The capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility in 2008 continuing through 2008, 2009 and 2010.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P96_S1	In some cases, the markets exerted significant downward pressure on availability of debt and equity capital for certain issuers (including short term liquidity and credit capacity).
24090_11_ITEM1A_P96_S2	We believe the availability of debt and equity capital has decreased significantly compared to prior years.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P97_S0	The availability of equity and debt financing to us will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit capacity, as well as the possibility that investors or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P97_S1	Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets may also limit our access to equity capital for us to seek to expand our business.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P97_S2	As such, we may be forced to delay raising debt or equity capital, or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could adversely affect our ability to seek any acquisitions and negatively impact profitability of an acquisition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P98_S0	There can be no assurance that actions of the U.S. Government, the Federal Reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets will achieve the intended effect.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P99_S0	In response to the financial crises affecting the U.S. banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions, in October 2008, President Bush signed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the EESA ) into law.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P99_S1	Pursuant to the EESA, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to, among other things, purchase up to $700 billion of mortgage-backed and other securities from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets and invest in financial services companies.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P100_S0	The Federal Government, the Federal Reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address the current financial crisis, including purchases of commercial paper or other debt.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P101_S0	In February 2009, President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which provided for Federal spending and tax cuts, estimated in the aggregate to be approximately $789 billion, for the purpose of job preservation and creation, infrastructure investment, energy efficiency and science, unemployment assistance, state and local government fiscal stabilization and other associated purposes.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P102_S0	The positive effect on the U.S. economy is unclear.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P102_S1	There can be no assurance as to what impact such actions and any future U.S. government s purported fiscal stimuli will have on the financial markets, including the high levels of volatility currently being experienced.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P102_S2	Such continued volatility could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, or the trading price of our Class A common stock.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Unexpected losses in future reporting periods may require us to adjust the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P104_S0	The Company s valuation allowance of $2.5 million at December 31, 2009 relative to our deferred tax asset ( DTA ) was released, and there was no allowance at December 31, 2010.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P104_S1	The valuation allowance was previously established based on facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, which indicated it was more likely than not that some or all of the DTA would not be realized.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Currently, we evaluate our DTA quarterly for recoverability based on available evidence.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P106_S0	This process involves management s judgment about assumptions, which are subject to change from period to period due to tax rate changes or variances between our projected operating performance and our actual results.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P106_S1	Ultimately, future adjustments to the DTA valuation allowance, if any, will be determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P107_S0	The realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry back or carry forward periods under applicable tax law.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we may be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P108_S1	Such an adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and capital position.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P109_S0	The price of our Class A common stock may be impacted by the level of participation in the Citizens, Inc., Stock Investment Plan (the Plan ).
24090_11_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Most all of our international policyholders participate in the Plan and they invest their policy dividends and benefits in our Class A common stock pursuant to the Plan.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P110_S1	Once a policyholder elects to participate in the Plan, his or her policy benefits can be used to purchase Citizens Class A common stock under the Plan.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P110_S2	There is a risk our Class A common stock price could be negatively impacted by a decrease in our policyholders participation in the Plan.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P110_S3	If fewer policyholders elect to participate in the Plan, or our international premium collections were to decrease as a result of regulatory, economic, or marketing impediments, the participation in the Plan could decrease and our Class A common stock price could be negatively impacted.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Control of our Company, through the ownership of our Class B Common Stock, may be held by a 501(c)(3) charitable foundation established by our Founder and we cannot determine whether any change in our management, operations, or operating strategies will occur as a result of such an ownership change.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Harold E. Riley, our Founder, Chairman and CEO, is the beneficial owner of 100% of the Citizens Class B common stock, which is held in the name of the Harold E. Riley Trust ( Trust ), of which he serves as Trustee.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P112_S1	Citizens Class A and Class B common stock are identical in all respects, except the Class B common stock elects a simple majority of the Board and receives one-half of any cash dividends paid on a per share basis as the Class A shares.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P112_S2	Therefore, Mr. Riley controls our Company.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P112_S3	The Class A common stock elects the remainder of the Board.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P112_S4	The Trust documents provide that upon Mr. Riley s death, the Class B common stock will be transferred from the Trust to the Harold E. Riley Foundation, a charitable organization established under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Foundation ).
24090_11_ITEM1A_P112_S5	In addition, the Trust documents provide that Mr. Riley may at any time transfer the Class B common stock held by the Trust to the Foundation.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P112_S6	It is unclear what, if any, changes would occur to our board, management structure, or corporate operating strategies as a result of different ownership of our Class B common stock.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P113_S0	There are a substantial number of our issued shares of Class A common stock eligible for future sale in the public market.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P113_S1	The sale of these shares could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fall.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P114_S0	There were 48,686,759 shares of our Class A common stock issued as of December 31, 2010.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P114_S1	Our executive officers, directors and management owned approximately 4,580,000 shares of our Class A common stock as of December 31, 2010, representing approximately 9% of our then outstanding Class A common stock.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P114_S2	Almost all of these shares have been registered for public resale and generally may be sold freely.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P114_S3	In the event of a sale of some or all of these shares or the perceived sale of these shares, the market price of our Class A common stock could fall substantially.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P115_S0	The price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P116_S0	Our Class A common stock price has historically fluctuated and is likely to fluctuate in the future and could decline materially because of the volatility of the stock market in general, decreased participation in the Plan referred to above or a variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: quarterly or annual variations in actual or anticipated results of our operations; interest rate fluctuations; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; competition and other factors affecting the life insurance business generally; and conditions in the U.S. and world economies.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P117_S0	Our Class A common shareholders do not control us and have a limited ability to influence our business policies and corporate actions and are not by themselves able to elect any of our directors.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P118_S0	It is difficult for Class A common shareholders to elect any of our directors or otherwise exert any significant influence over our business.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P118_S1	The sole holder of our outstanding Class B common stock is entitled to elect a simple majority of our board of directors and therefore controls us.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P118_S2	All of our Class B common stock is currently owned by the Harold E. Riley Trust, of which Harold E. Riley, our founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, is the sole trustee.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P118_S3	Additionally, Harold E. Riley beneficially owns approximately 7% of the issued shares of our Class A common stock.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as applicable state insurance laws, may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P120_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as various state insurance laws, may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a takeover attempt our shareholders might consider in their best interests.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P120_S1	As a result, our shareholders will be prevented from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our Class A common stock that may be offered by a bidder in a takeover context.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P120_S2	Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P121_S0	The following provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws make it difficult for our Class A shareholders to replace or remove our directors and have other anti-takeover effects that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt:
24090_11_ITEM1A_P122_S0	our board of directors may issue one or more series of preferred stock without the approval of our shareholders.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P123_S0	State insurance laws generally require prior approval of a change in control of an insurance company.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P123_S1	Generally, such laws provide that control over an insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the insurer.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P124_S0	In considering an application to acquire control of an insurer, an insurance commissioner generally will consider such factors as the experience, competence and financial strength of the proposed acquirer, the integrity of the proposed acquirer s board of directors and executive officers, the proposed acquirer s plans for the management and operation of the insurer, and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the acquisition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P124_S1	In addition, a person seeking to acquire control of an insurance company is required in some states to make filings prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and the target insurance company and their affiliates have sufficiently large market shares in particular lines of insurance in those states.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P124_S2	These state insurance requirements may delay, deter or prevent our ability to complete an acquisition.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P125_S0	We have never paid any cash dividends on our Class A common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P126_S0	We have never paid cash dividends on our Class A common stock, as it is our policy to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business.
24090_11_ITEM1A_P126_S1	We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
24090_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	We own our principal office in Austin, Texas, consisting of an 80,000 square foot office building in addition to approximately one acre of land nearby that houses storage facilities.
24090_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	Approximately 50,000 square feet is occupied or reserved for our operations.
24090_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also own a training facility at Lake Buchanan, Texas.
24090_11_ITEM2_P0_S3	In addition, we own other properties in Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana that are incidental to our operations.
24090_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are a defendant in a lawsuit filed on August 6, 1999 in the Texas District Court, Austin, Texas, now styled Delia Bolanos Andrade, et al., Plaintiffs, v. Citizens Insurance Company of America, et al., Defendants in which a class was originally certified by the trial court and reversed by the Texas Supreme Court in 2007 with an order to the trial court to conduct further proceedings consistent with its ruling.
24090_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	The underlying lawsuit alleged that certain life insurance policies CICA made available to non-U.S. residents, when combined with a policy feature that allowed certain cash benefits to be assigned to two non-U.S. trusts for the purpose of accumulating ownership of our Class A common stock, along with allowing the policyholders to make additional contributions to the trusts, were actually offers and sales of securities that occurred in Texas by unregistered dealers in violation of the Texas securities laws.
24090_11_ITEM3_P0_S2	The remedy sought was rescission and return of the insurance premium payments.
24090_11_ITEM3_P0_S3	On December 9, 2009, the trial court denied the recertification of the class after conducting additional proceedings in accordance with the Texas Supreme Court s ruling.
24090_11_ITEM3_P0_S4	The remaining plaintiffs must now proceed individually, and not as a class, if they intend to pursue their cases against us.
24090_11_ITEM3_P0_S5	We intend to maintain a vigorous defense in any remaining proceedings.
24090_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	In addition to the legal proceeding described above, we may from time to time be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our future, current and past business operations, including, but not limited to:
24090_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	disputes relating to businesses acquired and operated by us.
24090_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	In the absence of countervailing considerations, we would expect to defend any such claims vigorously.
24090_11_ITEM3_P3_S1	However, in doing so, we could incur significant defense costs, including not only attorneys fees and other direct litigation costs, but also the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_11_ITEM3_P3_S2	If we suffer an adverse judgment as a result of any claim, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) under the symbol CIA.
24090_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	Quarterly high and low closing prices per share of our Class A common stock as reported by the NYSE are shown below.
24090_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	The number of stockholders on record on March 8, 2011 was as follows:
24090_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	We have never paid cash dividends on our Class A or B common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
24090_11_ITEM5_P3_S1	For restrictions on our present and future ability to pay dividends, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
24090_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	We did not purchase any of our equity securities during any quarter in 2008, 2009 or 2010.
24090_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	We do not maintain any equity compensation plans or arrangements.
24090_11_ITEM5_P5_S1	Thus, we do not have any securities authorized for issuance under these types of plans, nor have we issued any options, warrants or similar instruments to purchase any of our equity securities, except for warrants issued in conjunction with the convertible preferred stock issued in 2004 and 2005.
24090_11_ITEM5_P5_S2	See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
24090_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table presents selected financial data of the Company.
24090_11_ITEM6_P0_S1	This should be read in conjunction with Item 7.

24090_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for information that may affect the comparability of the financial data contained in the above table.
24090_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following is management s discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations of the Company.
24090_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	It is intended to be a discussion of certain key financial information regarding the Company and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes to this report on Form 10-K.
24090_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	We conduct operations as an insurance holding company emphasizing ordinary life insurance products in niche markets where we believe we can achieve competitive advantages.
24090_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	As an insurance provider, we collect premiums on an ongoing basis to pay future benefits to our policy and contract holders.
24090_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	For over the past 30 years, CICA and its predecessors have accepted policy applications from foreign nationals for U.S. Dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies.
24090_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	We make our insurance products available using third-party marketing organizations and independent marketing consultants.
24090_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Through the domestic market of our Life Insurance segment, we provide ordinary whole life, credit life insurance, and final expense policies to middle income families and individuals in certain markets in the mid-west and southern U.S.
24090_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	The majority of our revenues are the result of acquisitions of domestic life insurance companies since 1987.
24090_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	We provide final expense ordinary life insurance to middle and lower income individuals in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through a home service marketing distribution system utilizing employee-agents who work on a route system to collect premiums and service policyholders, and through networks of funeral homes who collect premiums and provide personal policyholder service.
24090_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company derives its revenues principally from 1) premiums earned for insurance coverages provided to insureds; 2) net investment income; and 3) net realized capital gains and losses.
24090_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Profitability of our operations depends heavily upon the Company s underwriting discipline, which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, management of claims, use of reinsurance, the size of our in force block, actual mortality and morbidity experience, and our ability to manage our expense ratio, which we accomplish through economies of scale and management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses.
24090_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future losses based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the Company s response to competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels.
24090_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	The Company seeks to price our insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin.
24090_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	For many of our insurance products, the Company is required to obtain approval for the premium rates from state insurance departments.
24090_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	The profitability of fixed annuities, riders and other spread-based product features depends largely on the Company s ability to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on assets and interest credited to policyholders.
24090_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	The investment return, or yield, on invested assets is an important element of the Company s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before benefits are paid.
24090_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	The majority of the Company s invested assets have been held in available-for-sale securities, including, among other asset classes, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and government obligation bonds.
24090_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	The primary investment objective for the Company is to maximize economic value, consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including the management of credit risk and interest rate sensitivity of invested assets, while generating sufficient after-tax income to meet policyholder and corporate obligations.
24090_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	The Company maintains a conservative investment strategy that may vary based on a variety of factors including business needs, regulatory requirements and tax considerations.
24090_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Described below are some of the significant trends affecting the life insurance industry and the possible effects they may have on our future operations.
24090_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	As an increasing percentage of the world population reaches retirement age, we believe we will benefit from increased demand for living products rather than death products, as aging baby boomers will require cash accumulation to pay expenses to meet their lifetime needs.
24090_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	Our ordinary life products are designed to accumulate cash values to provide for living expenses in a policy owner s later years, while continuously providing a death benefit.
24090_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	We believe there is a trend toward consolidation of domestic life insurance companies, due to significant losses incurred by the life insurance industry as a result of the credit crisis and recent economic pressures, as well as increasing costs of regulatory compliance for domestic life insurance companies.
24090_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	We believe this trend should be a benefit to our acquisition strategy as more complementary acquisition candidates may become available for us to consider.
24090_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Many of the events and trends affecting the life insurance industry have had an impact on the life reinsurance industry.
24090_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	These events have led to a decline in the availability of reinsurance.
24090_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	While we currently cede a limited amount of our primary insurance business to reinsurers, we may find it difficult to obtain reinsurance in the future, forcing us to seek reinsurers who are more expensive to us.
24090_11_ITEM7_P16_S3	If we cannot obtain affordable reinsurance coverage, either our net exposures will increase or we will have to reduce our underwriting commitments.
24090_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	While our management has more than 40 years of experience in writing life insurance policies for foreign residents, changes related to foreign government laws and regulations and application of them, along with currency controls affecting our foreign resident insureds could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	In 2008, the Company acquired ONLIC, an Arkansas domiciled life company.
24090_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	This entity provided an Arkansas field force of home service agents and funeral homes selling pre-need and final expense policies and was merged into SPLIC as of December 31, 2009, and is included in the Home Service segment.
24090_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	In the first quarter of 2009, the Company completed its acquisition of Integrity Capital Corporation ( ICC ).
24090_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	ICC is the parent of Integrity Capital Insurance Company ( ICIC ), an Indiana life insurance company that is included in the Life Insurance segment.
24090_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Insurance revenues are primarily generated from premium revenues and investment income.
24090_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	In addition, realized gains and losses on investment holdings can significantly impact revenues from year to year.
24090_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Premium income derived from life, accident and health, and property insurance sales, increased 3.2% during 2010 to $152.1 million from $147.3 million in 2009.
24090_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	The increase resulted primarily from renewal premiums, which totaled $127.1 million, $123.2 million and $116.6 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
24090_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Endowment sales represent a significant portion of new business sales internationally, as these products have gained in popularity over the past several years.
24090_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	In addition, most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision, which allows the policyholder to use cash value of a policy to pay premiums.
24090_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	The policy loan asset balance increased 10.9% year over year.
24090_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Net investment income increased $0.5 million with $30.1 million in 2010 compared to $29.6 million in 2009, primarily reflecting higher average invested balances as a result of investment of new premium revenue, partially offset by lower interest rates.
24090_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Net investment income performance is summarized as follows.
24090_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	Investment yields have declined over the past several years, as the Company experienced significant calls by issuers of fixed maturity securities and those proceeds were reinvested into new securities yielding lower returns as the market rates declined.
24090_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	In the current low yield environment, we anticipate investment income will decline despite the higher invested asset balances.
24090_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	We continue to invest in bonds of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, such as Federal National Mortgage Association ( FNMA ) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association ( FHLMC ), due to our conservative investment strategy of investing in high quality issuers.
24090_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Company increased holdings in corporate and municipal bonds during the current year and over 87.1% of total investment income in 2010 was attributable to the Company holdings of fixed maturity securities.
24090_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	Policy loan income increased in the current year due to the growth in the asset balance, as policyholders utilized the policy loan feature to pay premiums and keep policies in force.
24090_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Income related to equity securities declined in the current year due to the fact the Company disposed of a significant number of these securities during the year, resulting in lower investment income from dividends.
24090_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	The majority of the disposed securities had been previously impaired.
24090_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	Other investment income for the year ended December 31, 2009 included a legal settlement of $0.2 million in connection with a defaulted bond investment.
24090_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments .
24090_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	During the current year, the Company realized net gains of $1.7 million on security sales that were primarily below investment-grade quality and related to assets of an acquired entity.
24090_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	In 2010 and 2009, the Company sold equity mutual funds, which were previously impaired, and realized gains of $6.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively.
24090_11_ITEM7_P28_S3	The Company also sold a number of fixed maturity investments in 2009, resulting in a total gain of $8.0 million.
24090_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Included in this component are other-than-temporary impairments on securities recorded related to credit losses.
24090_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	One security which had been previously impaired was written down with a charge to income of $27,000 during 2010.
24090_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	In 2009, the Company recorded $0.3 million in realized losses related to other-than-temporary impairments due to market declines and issuer credit deterioration.
24090_11_ITEM7_P29_S3	In 2008, the Company recognized other-than-temporary impairment write-downs of $23.5 million on its holdings of equity mutual funds.
24090_11_ITEM7_P29_S4	In addition, we also impaired two bonds due to credit quality, recognizing a realized loss of $0.3 million.
24090_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	Realized gains (losses) are as follows:
24090_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Decrease (Increase) in Fair Value of Warrants .
24090_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	Because the market value of our Class A common stock decreased during 2010 and 2009, we recognized a gain on the decrease in fair value of warrants of $0.2 million and $3.2 million, compared to a loss of $2.7 million in 2008.
24090_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	The gains in 2010 and 2009 were directly related to the decrease in the price of our Class A common stock.
24090_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	The warrant liability is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which projects the future value of the warrants when they expire in July 2011 and 2012.
24090_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	Current accounting standards require the change in the value of the warrant liability be recorded as a component of revenues.
24090_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	When the liability increases we incur a loss, and when the liability decreases we recognize income.
24090_11_ITEM7_P32_S3	The warrant liability is not anticipated to have an effect on the Company s cash flows, as the Company expects the warrants will either be exercised and converted into our Class A common stock in July 2012, or sooner, at the election of the warrant holders, or expire.
24090_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	Benefits and expenses are summarized as follows:
24090_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	As noted in the table below, claims and surrenders increased 1.8% from $60.0 million in 2009 to $61.0 million in 2010.
24090_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	The 2010 increase primarily related to an increase in endowment benefits, as well as an increase in other policy benefits, which is mostly interest on other policyholder liabilities.
24090_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	These policy related interest bearing liabilities increased $7.3 million in 2010 over 2009.
24090_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Company monitors death claims based upon expectations.
24090_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	The claims experience has remained relatively consistent over the last three years.
24090_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	These values may routinely fluctuate from year to year.
24090_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	Policy surrenders increased in 2010 and 2009 compared to 2008, but remained at a level that represents approximately 0.4% of direct insurance inforce.
24090_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	The increase in surrender expense is primarily related to our international business and is expected to increase over time due to the aging of this block of business.
24090_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	A significant portion of surrenders relates to policies that have been in force over fifteen years and no longer have a surrender charge associated with them.
24090_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	Total direct insurance inforce reported in 2010 was $4.5 billion, and in 2009 was $4.4 billion compared to $4.3 billion in 2008.
24090_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Endowment benefits increased in each of the last three years.
24090_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	We have a series of international policies that carry an immediate endowment benefit of an amount elected by the policy owner.
24090_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	These benefits have been popular in the Pacific Rim and Latin America, where the Company has experienced increased interest in our guaranteed products in recent years.
24090_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	Like policy dividends, endowments are factored into the premium and, as such, the increase has no impact on profitability.
24090_11_ITEM7_P40_S3	The Company expects these benefits to continue to increase as this block of business increases.
24090_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	The change in future policy benefit reserves has increased over the past several years.
24090_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	Sales of certain endowment products, which build reserves at a much higher rate, have gained popularity in our international markets and have contributed to the increasing reserves over the past several years.
24090_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	Endowment sales totaled approximately $9.4 million, $8.5 million and $7.4 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
24090_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Company issues long duration participating policies to foreign residents that are expected to pay dividends to policyholders based upon actual experience.
24090_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	Policyholder dividends are factored into the premiums and have no impact on profitability.
24090_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Commission expense fluctuates in a direct relationship to new and renewal insurance premiums.
24090_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	Underwriting, Acquisition and Insurance Expense .
24090_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses decreased over the past several years as management has eliminated inefficiencies and improved processes.
24090_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	The decrease year to year was primarily related to lower audit and consulting fees.
24090_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Capitalized deferred policy acquisition costs ( DAC ) were $28.0 million, $27.1 million and $29.2 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008.
24090_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	These costs will vary based upon new and renewal business.
24090_11_ITEM7_P45_S2	Significantly lower amounts are capitalized related to renewal business.
24090_11_ITEM7_P45_S3	Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs has decreased from the 2009 level of $20.7 million to $17.8 million in 2010, as policy persistency improved.
24090_11_ITEM7_P45_S4	Amortization amounts increased in 2009 to $20.7 million compared to $20.8 million in 2008 due to policy surrenders the Company experienced in the latter part of 2008 and throughout 2009.
24090_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	Cost of Customer Relationships Acquired and Other Intangibles .
24090_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	The 2009 increase related primarily to the ICC acquisition and greater amortization due to the increase in lapses on this new block of business.
24090_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	Federal income tax expense was $4.1 million, $3.3 million and $3.1 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of 20.9%, 15.8% and 24.7%, respectively.
24090_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	The Company established a tax valuation allowance related to other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) losses on its mutual funds of $6.9 million in 2008.
24090_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	The establishment of the valuation allowance had the effect of increasing tax expense.
24090_11_ITEM7_P47_S3	In 2009, $2.8 million of this allowance was released as a reduction of tax expense primarily due to the sale of approximately 42% of the mutual fund portfolio in 2009.
24090_11_ITEM7_P47_S4	The remaining $2.5 million valuation allowance was released in 2010, as the Company sold investments at a gain that enabled it to realize the tax basis losses, thereby making the valuation allowance no longer necessary.
24090_11_ITEM7_P47_S5	In addition, the fair value change related to outstanding warrants of $0.2 million reported as an increase in revenues in 2010 and $3.2 million in 2009 compared to a decrease in revenues of $2.7 million in 2008, which was not taxable and also impacted the corporate tax rate.
24090_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	The Company has three reportable segments: Life Insurance, Home Service Insurance and Other Non-Insurance Enterprises.
24090_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	These segments are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
24090_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	The Company evaluates profit and loss performance based on net income before Federal income taxes.
24090_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Our Life Insurance segment consists of issuing primarily ordinary whole life insurance in U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents in approximately 30 countries through over 2,400 independent marketing consultants, and domestically through 275 independent marketing firms and consultants throughout the United States.
24090_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	Premium revenues increased for 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008, primarily due to higher renewal premiums, which have been trending up as this block of insurance ages.
24090_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	In addition, sales from Venezuela, Taiwan, Colombia and Ecuador represented the majority of the first year premium increase.
24090_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	Life Insurance premium breakout is detailed below.
24090_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	Net investment income decreased to $16.5 million in 2010 compared to $16.7 million and $17.0 million in 2008.
24090_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	The decrease is related to lower investment rates available in 2010 on new business funds invested, as well as on reinvested funds caused by the significant call activity the Company experienced in the last two years.
24090_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	Approximately $263.6 million and $215.0 million in bonds matured or were called by issuers in 2010 and 2009 on a total life segment portfolio of $346.2 million and $289.6 million.
24090_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Realized gains of $6.6 million were recognized in 2010, due primarily to disposals of previously impaired equity mutual funds.
24090_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	Realized gains totaled $1.1 million in 2009 resulting from sales of available-for-sale fixed income securities, compared to realized losses of $13.9 million in 2008, primarily resulting from other-than-temporary impairments recognized on equity mutual fund holdings in 2008.
24090_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	A breakout of claims and surrender benefits is detailed below:
24090_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Endowment benefits have increased due to overall increase of endowment product sales in the past several years.
24090_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	Other policy benefits includes most notably interest credited on policy funds and dividends and coupons left on deposit at interest.
24090_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	Other Underwriting, Acquisition and Insurance Expenses .
24090_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	The operating expenses increased from 2009 to 2010, due to renegotiating our agreement with Texas International Life Insurance Company ( TILIC ) whereby we paid $0.2 million, and an increase in credit card processing fees of approximately $0.2 million, as an increased number of policyholders are using our credit card payment option.
24090_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	The operating expenses have declined from 2008 to 2009 due to lower expenses related to staffing reductions, accountants and other consultants.
24090_11_ITEM7_P57_S3	The Company monitors all operating expenses and continues to seek efficiencies in our operations.
24090_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Our Home Service Insurance segment provides pre-need and final expense ordinary life insurance and annuities to middle and lower income individuals primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	Our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through funeral homes and a home service marketing distribution system utilizing approximately 600 employee and independent agents.
24090_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	The premium increases were due to enhanced marketing efforts to promote the Home Service segment, as well as a SPFIC rate increase that was effective in the latter part of 2009.
24090_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	The Company has received approval for an additional rate increase for SPFIC of approximately 5.7% that became effective January 1, 2011.
24090_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	The current year increase was due to the increased size of the asset portfolio provided by new business sales and income earned on the portfolio.
24090_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	The Company experienced significant call activity beginning in the second quarter of 2009, which depressed our investment income and lowered portfolio yields.
24090_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	Call activity was again significant in the latter part of the second quarter of 2010, which resulted in a further reduction of investment income The 2009 results included a one-time positive adjustment from a legal settlement of $0.2 million related to a defaulted bond.
24090_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Gains of $1.5 million in 2010 relate primarily to sales of below investment grade securities that were added to the portfolio as part of an acquisition and had been previously impaired.
24090_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	Gains reported in 2009 totaled $6.6 million compared to losses of $9.9 million in 2008.
24090_11_ITEM7_P61_S2	The net gains in 2009 related primarily to sales of equity mutual funds that had been previously impaired.
24090_11_ITEM7_P61_S3	The impairments in 2008 relating to equity mutual funds totaled $9.9 million relative to the Home Service segment.
24090_11_ITEM7_P61_S4	Additional impairments of $0.3 million were recorded in 2009 due to further declines in fair values relating to credit issues.
24090_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	Death claims vary from year to year, but were within expected actuarial expectations.
24090_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	Surrenders have been increasing as the Home Service block grows.
24090_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	The results in 2008 included incurred claims from Hurricanes Ike and Gustav totaling $0.8 million.
24090_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	A breakout of claims and surrender benefits is detailed below.
24090_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	Increase in Future Policy Benefit Reserves .
24090_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	The reserves in 2009 included a decrease of $0.4 million resulting from a correction related to Ozark National Life Insurance Company, which was acquired in 2008.
24090_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	Other Underwriting, Acquisition and Insurance Expenses .
24090_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	The decrease in 2010 was related to a reduction in premium taxes due to the utilization of larger tax credits and a reduction in salary expenses as part of a staff reduction plan.
24090_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	Overall, other non-insurance operations are relatively immaterial to the consolidated results, except for the fair value adjustment related to the Company s warrants to purchase Class A common stock.
24090_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	The fair value adjustment as of December 31, 2010 was $0.2 million, which was recorded as revenue, compared to revenue of $3.2 million recorded for 2009 and a reduction of revenue of $2.7 million in 2008.
24090_11_ITEM7_P67_S2	These amounts fluctuate due to the movement in our Class A common stock price and fair value calculation using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
24090_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	The administration of our investment portfolios is handled by our management, pursuant to board-approved investment guidelines, with all trading activity approved by a committee of the respective boards of directors of our insurance company subsidiaries.
24090_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	The guidelines used require that bonds, both government and corporate, are of high quality, investment grade and comprise a majority of the investment portfolio.
24090_11_ITEM7_P68_S2	State insurance statutes prescribe the quality and percentage of the various types of investments that may be made by insurance companies and generally permit investment in qualified state, municipal, federal and foreign government obligations, high quality corporate bonds, preferred and common stock, real estate, mortgage loans and real estate within certain specified percentages.
24090_11_ITEM7_P68_S3	The assets selected are intended to mature in accordance with the average maturity of the insurance products and to provide the cash flow for our insurance company subsidiaries to meet their respective policyholder obligations.
24090_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	The following table shows the carrying value of our investments by investment category and cash and cash equivalents, and the percentage of each to total invested assets.
24090_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	The current year decline in U.S. government-sponsored securities is due to call activity from this sector and reinvestment into fixed maturity bond categories.
24090_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	The Company has increased investments in the current year in municipals primarily related to Build America taxable bonds and corporate issuer holdings in the utility sector.
24090_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	At December 31, 2010, investments in fixed maturity and equity securities were 87.6% of our total cash, and cash equivalents and investments.
24090_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	All of our fixed maturities were classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2010.
24090_11_ITEM7_P71_S2	We had no fixed maturity or equity securities that were classified as trading securities at December 31, 2010 or 2009.
24090_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	The following table shows the distribution of the credit ratings of our portfolio of fixed maturity securities by carrying value.
24090_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	As noted, the Company held municipal securities with third party guarantees.
24090_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	Detailed below is a presentation by rating.
24090_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	The credit rating distribution has changed in the current year as AAA government-sponsored issues were called during the year and reinvested in municipal and corporate bond holdings with ratings of AA and BBB.
24090_11_ITEM7_P75_S1	The Company purchases exclusively investment grade securities, and the increase in the below investment grade category is due to municipals that were rated investment grade at December 31, 2009 and as of December 31, 2010 were no longer rated.
24090_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	The Company experienced a significant amount of maturities and call activity relative to the fixed income portfolio, with $387.4 million reported in 2010 compared to $292.7 million and $162.3 million in 2009 and 2008.
24090_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	As interest rates declined over the past two years, issuers called those holdings and the Company reinvested into lower yielding securities.
24090_11_ITEM7_P76_S2	The gross investment yield on the fixed maturity securities portfolio dropped approximately 40 basis points from 2009 compared to 2010.
24090_11_ITEM7_P76_S3	We expect lower yields on our investment portfolio due to the current low interest rate environment.
24090_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of our fixed maturity and equity securities at least quarterly.
24090_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	The Company monitors all debt and equity securities on an on-going basis relative to changes in credit ratings, market prices, earnings trends and financial performance, in addition to specific region or industry reviews.
24090_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on a case-by-case evaluation of underlying reasons for the decline in fair value.
24090_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	The Company determines other-than-temporary impairment by reviewing all relevant evidence related to the specific security issuer as well as the Company s intent to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost.
24090_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	When an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings depends on whether the Company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis.
24090_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	If the Company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_11_ITEM7_P80_S2	If the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Company is required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the other-than-temporary impairment will be separated into the following: a) the amount representing the credit loss; and b) the amount related to all other factors.
24090_11_ITEM7_P80_S3	The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings.
24090_11_ITEM7_P80_S4	The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_11_ITEM7_P80_S5	The previous amortized cost basis less the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_11_ITEM7_P80_S6	The new amortized cost is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value.
24090_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	With the exception of SPLIC, virtually all of our subsidiaries fixed maturity investments are in U.S. Government or U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises or U.S. Government instruments.
24090_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	SPLIC has significant investments in corporate and municipal bonds.
24090_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	An additional impairment of $27,000 was recorded in 2010 to write a security down to zero carrying value.
24090_11_ITEM7_P82_S2	In 2009, the Company impaired three bonds for $0.1 million and a number of common stocks totaling $0.2 million.
24090_11_ITEM7_P82_S3	These 2009 impairments resulted from declines due to credit quality of the issuers and have been reflected as a realized loss in the accompanying income statement.
24090_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	The Company impaired two bonds totaling $0.3 million during 2008, because the Company did not expect these securities to recover in value.
24090_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	The Company recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges on its mutual fund equity securities in 2008 in the amount of $23.5 million because the Company did not expect these securities to recover in value in the near term.
24090_11_ITEM7_P83_S2	Based upon our emphasis on investing in fixed maturity securities primarily composed of obligations of U.S. Government-sponsored corporations and our analysis of whether declines in fair value below cost are temporary or other-than-temporary, management believes that our investments in fixed maturity investments at December 31, 2010 were not impaired, and no additional other-than-temporary losses need to be recorded.
24090_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities available-for-sale amounted to $13.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and $9.7 million as of December 31, 2009.
24090_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	This increase was primarily due to a lower interest rate environment, which put downward pricing pressure on the fair values of our U.S. Government, municipal and agency bonds.
24090_11_ITEM7_P84_S2	There were no gross unrealized losses on equity securities as of December 31, 2010.
24090_11_ITEM7_P84_S3	In 2010 and 2009, the Company sold equity mutual fund holdings from the Life and Home Service segments and recorded realized gains of $6.4 million and $4.9 million due to market recovery since impairment at December 31, 2008.
24090_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	Information on unrealized gains and losses by category is set forth in our consolidated financial statements, Note 2 Investments, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
24090_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	As is customary among insurance companies, our insurance company subsidiaries reinsure with other companies portions of the life insurance risks they underwrite.
24090_11_ITEM7_P86_S1	A primary purpose of reinsurance agreements is to enable an insurance company to reduce the amount of risk on any particular life and, by reinsuring the amount exceeding the maximum amount the insurance company is willing to retain, to insure individuals in amounts larger than it could without such agreements.
24090_11_ITEM7_P86_S2	Even though a portion of the risk may be reinsured, our insurance company subsidiaries remain liable to perform all the obligations imposed by the policies issued by them and could be liable if their reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements.
24090_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	We believe we have established appropriate reinsurance coverage based upon our net retained insured liabilities compared to our surplus.
24090_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	The effect of reinsurance on premiums is as follows:
24090_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries monitor the solvency of their reinsurers in seeking to minimize the risk of loss in the event of default by a reinsurer.
24090_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	The primary reinsurers of our insurance subsidiaries are large, well capitalized entities.
24090_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	The effect of reinsurance on life insurance in force is as follows:
24090_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	Virtually all of the Company s non-credit accident and health insurance has been reinsured and is administered by Texas International Life Insurance Company ( TILIC ), an unaffiliated party.
24090_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	The reinsurance recoverables under this agreement are collateralized by assets held in a trust for the benefit of the reinsured policies.
24090_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	The Company monitors the credit ratings of our life and property reinsurers.
24090_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	The ratings by A.M. Best Company range from B (Good) to A (Superior).
24090_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	SPFIC elected to increase the amount of first and second event catastrophe reinsurance in 2006 to $10.0 million per event from $7.1 million and raise its retention level to $500,000 per event from $250,000, after the negative effects from Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
24090_11_ITEM7_P94_S1	Thus, the first $500,000 of incurred claims and any claims in excess of $10.0 million were SPLIC s responsibility.
24090_11_ITEM7_P94_S2	The same reinsurance levels were in place for 2008 through 2010.
24090_11_ITEM7_P94_S3	The reinsurance premium for first event catastrophe reinsurance was $1,130,000, $1,075,000 and $750,000 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
24090_11_ITEM7_P94_S4	In 2008, SPFIC also paid reinsurance premiums in the amount of $478,000 for second and third event coverage due to Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008.
24090_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	Liquidity refers to a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the needs of its operations.
24090_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	Liquidity is managed on insurance operations to ensure stable and reliable sources of cash flows to meet obligations and is provided by a variety of sources.
24090_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	Our liquidity requirements are met primarily by funds provided from operations.
24090_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	Premium deposits and revenues, investment income and investment maturities are the primary sources of funds, while investment purchases, policy benefits, and operating expenses are the primary uses of funds.
24090_11_ITEM7_P96_S2	We historically have not had to liquidate investments to provide cash flow, but in 2008 SPFIC needed to sell $237,000 of bonds because of liquidity needs as a result of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike.
24090_11_ITEM7_P96_S3	There were no such liquidity issues in 2010 or 2009.
24090_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	Our investments consist primarily of marketable debt securities that could be readily converted to cash for liquidity needs.
24090_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a table disclosing our contractual obligations.
24090_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	A primary liquidity concern is the risk of an extraordinary level of early policyholder withdrawals.
24090_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	We include provisions within our insurance policies, such as surrender charges, that help limit and discourage early withdrawals.
24090_11_ITEM7_P98_S2	Since these contractual withdrawals, as well as the level of surrenders experienced, have been largely consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management, our associated cash outflows have, historically, not had an adverse impact on our overall liquidity.
24090_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	Individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy.
24090_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	Cash flow projections and cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios are also performed annually to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy.
24090_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	We currently anticipate that available liquidity sources and future cash flows will be adequate to meet our needs for funds.
24090_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	Cash flows from our insurance operations historically have been sufficient to meet current needs.
24090_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	Cash flows from operating activities were $60.5 million, $52.1 million and $46.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
24090_11_ITEM7_P101_S2	We have traditionally also had significant cash flows from both scheduled and unscheduled investment security maturities, redemptions, and prepayments, which totaled $387.4 million, $292.7 million and $162.3 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008.
24090_11_ITEM7_P101_S3	These cash flows, for the most part, are reinvested in fixed income securities.
24090_11_ITEM7_P101_S4	Net cash outflows from investment activity totaled $62.1 million, $68.8 million and $14.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
24090_11_ITEM7_P101_S5	The outflows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily related to the investment of excess cash and cash equivalents generated from operations during 2010.
24090_11_ITEM7_P101_S6	The Company s cash flows from financing activities were $2.6 million in 2010, $1.5 million in 2009 and $10.6 million in 2008.
24090_11_ITEM7_P101_S7	In 2008, the Company received $9.4 million from capital contributions relating to our Series A-1 preferred stock.
24090_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	Stockholders equity at December 31, 2010 was $227.6 million compared to $216.1 million at December 31, 2009.
24090_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	The 2010 increase was largely due to income earned during the period offset by a decrease in net unrealized gains on securities available-for-sale.
24090_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	Investments increased to $725.7 million at December 31, 2010 from $671.3 million at December 31, 2009, resulting in an 8.1% increase, mainly due to the increase in fixed income holdings in the Company s portfolio.
24090_11_ITEM7_P103_S1	The asset increased primarily from new and renewal premium income.
24090_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	Fixed maturities are categorized as fixed maturities available-for-sale, which are carried in our consolidated financial statements at fair value and held-to-maturity, which are carried at amortized cost.
24090_11_ITEM7_P104_S1	Fixed maturities available-for-sale were 79.3% of investments at December 31, 2010, and fixed maturities held-to-maturity were 11.1% of investments at December 31, 2010.
24090_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	Policy loans comprised 4.9% of invested assets at December 31, 2010 compared to 4.8% at December 31, 2009.
24090_11_ITEM7_P105_S1	These loans, which are secured by the underlying policy values, have yields ranging from 5% to 12% and maturities that are related to the maturity or termination of the applicable policies.
24090_11_ITEM7_P105_S2	Management believes we maintain adequate liquidity despite the uncertain maturities of these loans.
24090_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	Our cash balances at our primary depositories were significantly in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.
24090_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	Management monitors the solvency of all financial institutions in which we have funds to minimize the exposure for loss.
24090_11_ITEM7_P107_S1	Management does not believe we are at significant risk for such a loss.
24090_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	The NAIC has established minimum capital requirements in the form of Risk-Based Capital ( RBC ).
24090_11_ITEM7_P108_S1	Risk-based capital factors the type of business written by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company s business to develop a minimum level of capital called Authorized Control Level Risk-based Capital and compares this level to an adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves.
24090_11_ITEM7_P108_S2	Should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk-based capital fall below 200%, a series of actions by the affected company would begin.
24090_11_ITEM7_P108_S3	At December 31, 2010, all of our insurance subsidiaries were above the required minimum levels.
24090_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	Two of our subsidiaries fell below the minimum RBC threshold at December 31, 2008.
24090_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	A capital contribution of $1.0 million was made to SPFIC during the first quarter of 2009.
24090_11_ITEM7_P109_S2	An additional $1.0 million capital contribution was made to SPFIC in the third quarter of 2009.
24090_11_ITEM7_P109_S3	A capital contribution of $1.0 million was also made to Ozark National Life Insurance Company ( ONLIC ) during the first quarter of 2009 due to its RBC ratio falling below 200% at December 31, 2008.
24090_11_ITEM7_P109_S4	The decline in SPFIC s capital balance mainly resulted from hurricane losses in 2008 and an increase in operating expenses.
24090_11_ITEM7_P109_S5	The reduction in ONLIC s capital balance resulted from declines in asset values of preferred and common stock holdings.
24090_11_ITEM7_P109_S6	These capital contributions increased the RBC ratios and RBC action plans were submitted to the relevant insurance departments.
24090_11_ITEM7_P109_S7	The capital balance of ONLIC was determined to be at the Company Action Level at March 31, 2009 due to continued declines relative to its investment holdings.
24090_11_ITEM7_P109_S8	The capital contributions made in 2009 increased the ratios as anticipated in action plans submitted to the appropriate state insurance departments.
24090_11_ITEM7_P109_S9	The Company received approval from the respective state insurance departments to merge ONLIC into SPLIC as of October 1, 2009.
24090_11_ITEM7_P109_S10	The capital contributions did not impact the overall consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.
24090_11_ITEM7_P109_S11	All insurance subsidiaries were above the RBC minimums at December 31, 2010.
24090_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	Due to a decline in statutory surplus, CNLIC no longer met minimum capital and surplus requirements as of June 30, 2010 in two states it is licensed in, Florida, deficient by approximately $0.4 million, and Mississippi, deficient by approximately $0.5 million.
24090_11_ITEM7_P110_S1	CNLIC currently maintains its Certificate of Authority, but voluntarily suspended sales in these states and its licenses were suspended.
24090_11_ITEM7_P110_S2	Life premiums collected in 2009 were $2,000 and $9,800 and in 2010 were $1,200 and $8,000 relating exclusively to policy renewals in Florida and Mississippi, respectively.
24090_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	Effective September 1, 2010, CICA contributed 150,000 shares of Citizens, Inc.
24090_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	Class A common stock to CNLIC as a capital contribution.
24090_11_ITEM7_P111_S2	The contributed shares had a fair market contributed value of $1,032,000.
24090_11_ITEM7_P111_S3	These shares were subsequently purchased by Citizens, Inc., the ultimate parent, on September 13, 2010 for $1,041,000 cash.
24090_11_ITEM7_P111_S4	The transaction has been eliminated under consolidation accounting rules.
24090_11_ITEM7_P111_S5	Management is currently evaluating CNLIC s operations and strategy for the future, but does not anticipate any material change relative to the consolidated financial condition of the Company.
24090_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	The Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2010 and, therefore, does not expect any future effects on the Company s financial condition related to any such arrangements.
24090_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	We do not utilize special purpose entities as investment vehicles, nor are there any such entities in which we have an investment that engages in speculative activities of any nature, and we do not use such investments to hedge our investment positions.
24090_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	We are a holding company and have had minimal operations of our own.
24090_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	Our assets primarily consist of the capital stock of our subsidiaries.
24090_11_ITEM7_P114_S2	Accordingly, our cash flows depend upon the availability of statutorily permissible payments, primarily payments under management agreements from our two primary life insurance subsidiaries, CICA and SPLIC.
24090_11_ITEM7_P114_S3	The ability to make payments is limited by applicable laws and regulations of Colorado, CICA s state of domicile, and Louisiana, SPLIC s state of domicile, which subject insurance operations to significant regulatory restrictions.
24090_11_ITEM7_P114_S4	These laws and regulations require, among other things, that these insurance subsidiaries maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company.
24090_11_ITEM7_P114_S5	We historically have not relied upon dividends from subsidiaries for our cash flow needs and we do not intend to do so in the future.
24090_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	Additionally, a substantial portion of our international policyholders invest their policy cash dividends in our Class A common stock through our Stock Investment Plan (the Plan ).
24090_11_ITEM7_P115_S1	Once a policyholder elects to participate in the Plan, their policy dividends are assigned to purchase Citizens Class A common stock.
24090_11_ITEM7_P115_S2	In 2010, this represented stock investment in the Company of approximately $23 million.
24090_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	If fewer policyholders elect to participate in the Plan, or if our international premium collections were to decrease as a result of regulatory or marketing impediments, the trading volume of our Class A stock may decline from its present levels.
24090_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	Our critical accounting policies are as follows:
24090_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	Future policy benefit reserves have been computed by the net level premium method with assumptions as to investment yields, dividends on participating business, mortality and withdrawals based upon our experience.
24090_11_ITEM7_P118_S1	The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of policy liabilities and the increase in future policy benefit reserves.
24090_11_ITEM7_P118_S2	Management s judgments and estimates for future policy benefit reserves provide for possible unfavorable deviation.
24090_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	We continue to use the original assumptions (including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation) in subsequent periods to determine the changes in the liability for future policy benefits (the lock-in concept ) unless a premium deficiency exists.
24090_11_ITEM7_P119_S1	Management monitors these assumptions and has determined that a premium deficiency did not exist as of December 31, 2010.
24090_11_ITEM7_P119_S2	Management believes that our policy liabilities and increase in future policy benefit reserves as of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are based upon assumptions, including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation, that do not warrant revision.
24090_11_ITEM7_P119_S3	The relative stability of these assumptions and management s analysis is discussed below.
24090_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	Acquisition costs, consisting of commissions and policy issuance, underwriting and agency expenses that relate to and vary with the production of new business, are deferred.
24090_11_ITEM7_P120_S1	These deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized primarily over the estimated premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of the annual premium recognized to the total premium revenue anticipated, using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	We utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance.
24090_11_ITEM7_P121_S1	The factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period.
24090_11_ITEM7_P121_S2	The factor method ensures that policies that lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation.
24090_11_ITEM7_P121_S3	The factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value, provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors.
24090_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	Inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred, the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_11_ITEM7_P122_S1	Approximately 80% of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year excess commissions.
24090_11_ITEM7_P122_S2	The remaining 20% are attributed to costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new insurance business.
24090_11_ITEM7_P122_S3	Those costs generally include costs related to the production, underwriting and issuance of new business.
24090_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_11_ITEM7_P123_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 30 years.
24090_11_ITEM7_P123_S2	The available premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated.
24090_11_ITEM7_P123_S3	The deferred policy acquisition costs are then evaluated over two methods utilizing reasonable assumptions and two other methods using pessimistic assumptions.
24090_11_ITEM7_P123_S4	The two methods using reasonable assumptions illustrate an early-deferred policy acquisition recoverability period.
24090_11_ITEM7_P123_S5	The two methods utilizing pessimistic assumptions still support early recoverability of our aggregate deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	Management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value.
24090_11_ITEM7_P124_S1	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on capitalized expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business, utilization of the factor method and annual recoverability testing.
24090_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	Cost of Customer Relationships Acquired ( CCRA ) is established when we purchase a block of insurance.
24090_11_ITEM7_P125_S1	CCRA is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	We utilize various methods to determine the amount of the ending asset balance, including a static model and a dynamic model.
24090_11_ITEM7_P126_S1	Inherent in the amortization of CCRA are certain management judgments about the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_11_ITEM7_P126_S2	The assumptions used are based upon interest, mortality and lapses at the time of purchase.
24090_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_11_ITEM7_P127_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next thirty years.
24090_11_ITEM7_P127_S2	The CCRA is then evaluated utilizing reasonable assumptions.
24090_11_ITEM7_P127_S3	Management believes that our CCRA and related amortization is recoverable for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
24090_11_ITEM7_P127_S4	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on estimated future results of the block and our annual recoverability testing.
24090_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	Current accounting guidance requires that goodwill balances be review for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event has occurred.
24090_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment on one level below an operating segment.
24090_11_ITEM7_P129_S1	Most of the Company s reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated, are equivalent to the Company s operating segment, as there is no discrete financial information available for the separate components of the segment or all of the components of the segment have similar economic characteristics.
24090_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	The goodwill impairment test follows a two step process as defined under current accounting guidance.
24090_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
24090_11_ITEM7_P131_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment.
24090_11_ITEM7_P131_S2	In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value.
24090_11_ITEM7_P131_S3	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
24090_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	Management s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations, peer company price to earnings multiples, the level of the Company s Class A common stock price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit.
24090_11_ITEM7_P132_S1	Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections.
24090_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	The evaluation of securities for impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings.
24090_11_ITEM7_P133_S1	The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer s financial condition or future prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period.
24090_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	Based upon current accounting guidance, investment securities must be classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading.
24090_11_ITEM7_P134_S1	Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase.
24090_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities.
24090_11_ITEM7_P135_S1	Fixed maturity securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the Company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity.
24090_11_ITEM7_P135_S2	Securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings until realized.
24090_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	The Company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if an OTTI exists pursuant to the accounting guidelines.
24090_11_ITEM7_P136_S1	In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the ability and intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
24090_11_ITEM7_P136_S2	In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the Federal government or its agencies, by government-sponsored agencies, or whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and reviews of the issuer s financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM7_P137_S0	If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, management must then determine the amount of OTTI to be recognized in earnings.
24090_11_ITEM7_P137_S1	If management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.
24090_11_ITEM7_P137_S2	The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.
24090_11_ITEM7_P137_S3	The amount of OTTI related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_11_ITEM7_P137_S4	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_11_ITEM7_P137_S5	If management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_11_ITEM7_P137_S6	Any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain (as other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold.
24090_11_ITEM7_P138_S0	The Company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions, future market movements, business plan changes, or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time.
24090_11_ITEM7_P139_S0	Premiums on life and accident and health policies are reported as earned when due or, for short duration contracts, over the contract period on a pro rata basis.
24090_11_ITEM7_P139_S1	Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in recognition of profits over the estimated life of the contracts.
24090_11_ITEM7_P139_S2	This matching is accomplished by means of provisions for future benefits and the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_11_ITEM7_P140_S0	Annuities are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest bearing financial instruments.
24090_11_ITEM7_P141_S0	Our primary annuity products do not include fees or other such charges.
24090_11_ITEM7_P142_S0	A deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recorded only if a determination is made that is more-likely-than-not that the tax treatment on which the deferred tax item depends will be sustained in the event of an audit.
24090_11_ITEM7_P142_S1	These determinations inherently involve management s judgment.
24090_11_ITEM7_P142_S2	In addition, the Company must record a tax valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
24090_11_ITEM7_P142_S3	This valuation allowance is in essence a contra account to the deferred tax asset.
24090_11_ITEM7_P142_S4	Management must determine the portion of the deferred tax asset and resulting tax benefit that may not be realized based upon judgment of expected outcomes.
24090_11_ITEM7_P143_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_11_ITEM7_P143_S1	Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position.
24090_11_ITEM7_P144_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The nature of our business exposes us to investment market risk.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Market risk is the risk of loss that may occur when changes in interest rates and public equity prices adversely affect the value of our invested assets.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Interest rate risk is our primary market risk exposure.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can affect the fair value of our investments.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio generally increases when interest rates decrease and decreases when interest rates increase.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our exposure to interest rate changes results from our significant holdings of fixed maturity investments, policy loans and mortgage loans on real estate, all of which comprised over 89.4% of our cash and investment portfolio as of December 31, 2010.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	These investments are mainly exposed to changes in U.S. Treasury rates.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Our fixed maturities investments include U.S. Government-sponsored corporations, U.S. Government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, and corporate bonds.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Approximately 60.0% of the fixed maturities we owned at December 31, 2010 are instruments of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, or are backed by U.S. Government agencies.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	To manage interest rate risk, we perform periodic projections of asset and liability cash flows to evaluate the potential sensitivity of our investments and liabilities.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We assess interest rate sensitivity with respect to our fixed maturities investments using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward 100 basis point shifts in the prevailing interest rates.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The Company performs an analysis of fair values using 100 basis point upward and downward shifts in interest rates.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The following table sets forth the potential amount of unrealized losses that could be caused by 100 basis point upward shifts on our fixed maturities investments as of the dates indicated.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P4_S2	Declining interest rate scenarios are not reported due to the fact that current rates are low and we believe further declines are not probable.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The Company s portfolio has substantially been reinvested at the current lower rates due to the significant call activity experienced over the last several years.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	While the test scenario is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed-income markets, it is a near-term change that illustrates the potential impact of such events.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Due to the composition of our book of insurance business, we believe it is unlikely we would encounter large surrender activity due an interest rate increase that would force us to dispose of our fixed maturities at a loss.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P8_S0	There are no fixed maturities or other investments that we classify as trading instruments.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P8_S1	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had no investments in derivative instruments, nor does the Company have any subprime or CDO (collateralized debt obligation) risk.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Changes in the level or volatility of equity prices affect the value of equity securities we hold as investments.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P9_S1	However, our equity investments portfolio was less than 5% of our total investments at December 31, 2010.
24090_11_ITEM7A_P9_S2	Thus, we believe significant decreases in the equity markets would have an immaterial impact on our total investment portfolio.

24090_11_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We have audited Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).

24090_11_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
24090_11_ITEM9A_P7_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
24090_11_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
24090_11_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
24090_11_ITEM9A_P7_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
24090_11_ITEM9A_P8_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
24090_11_ITEM9A_P8_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
24090_11_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
24090_11_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

24090_11_ITEM15_P30_S0	Based upon current accounting guidance, investment securities must be classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading.
24090_11_ITEM15_P30_S1	Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase.
24090_11_ITEM15_P31_S0	The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities.
24090_11_ITEM15_P31_S1	Fixed maturity securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the Company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity.
24090_11_ITEM15_P31_S2	Securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings until realized.
24090_11_ITEM15_P32_S0	Fixed maturities consist primarily of bonds classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.
24090_11_ITEM15_P32_S1	The Company does not classify any fixed maturities as trading.
24090_11_ITEM15_P32_S2	Equity securities (including non-redeemable preferred stock) are considered available-for-sale and are reported at fair value.
24090_11_ITEM15_P33_S0	Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of equity securities and fixed maturities held as available-for-sale is shown as a separate component of stockholders equity, net of tax, and is a separate component of comprehensive income.
24090_11_ITEM15_P34_S0	The Company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if an other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) exists pursuant to the accounting guidelines.
24090_11_ITEM15_P34_S1	In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the ability and intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
24090_11_ITEM15_P34_S2	In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the Federal government or its agencies, by government-sponsored agencies, or whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and reviews of the issuer s financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM15_P35_S0	If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, management must then determine the amount of OTTI to be recognized in earnings.
24090_11_ITEM15_P35_S1	If management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.
24090_11_ITEM15_P35_S2	The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.
24090_11_ITEM15_P35_S3	The amount of OTTI related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_11_ITEM15_P35_S4	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_11_ITEM15_P35_S5	If management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_11_ITEM15_P35_S6	Any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain (as other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold.
24090_11_ITEM15_P36_S0	The Company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions, future market movements, business plan changes, or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time.
24090_11_ITEM15_P37_S0	Mortgage loans on real estate and policy loans are reported at unpaid principal balances.
24090_11_ITEM15_P38_S0	Real estate and other long-term investments consist primarily of land and buildings that are recorded at depreciated cost.
24090_11_ITEM15_P38_S1	If the fair value of the real estate is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized and charged to earnings.
24090_11_ITEM15_P39_S0	Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method.
24090_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	Dividend and interest income is recognized when earned.
24090_11_ITEM15_P40_S1	Realized gains and losses are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold.
24090_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	The Company had cash equivalents and fixed maturities with an aggregate fair value of $11,122,000 and $9,947,000 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, on deposit with various state regulatory authorities to fulfill statutory requirements.
24090_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	Premiums on life policies are recognized as earned when due.
24090_11_ITEM15_P42_S1	Due premiums on the balance sheet are net of allowances.
24090_11_ITEM15_P43_S0	Accident and health policies are recognized as revenue over the contract period on a pro rata basis.
24090_11_ITEM15_P43_S1	Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in the recognition of profits over the estimated lives of the contracts.
24090_11_ITEM15_P43_S2	This matching is accomplished by means of a provision for future policy benefits and the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	Annuity policies, primarily flexible premium fixed annuity products, are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest bearing financial instruments.
24090_11_ITEM15_P44_S1	Premium receipts are not reported as revenue, rather as deposit liabilities to annuity contracts.
24090_11_ITEM15_P44_S2	The annuity products issued do not include fees or other such charges.
24090_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	Acquisition costs, consisting of commissions and policy issuance, underwriting and agency expenses that are primarily related to and vary with the production of new and renewal business, have been deferred.
24090_11_ITEM15_P45_S1	These deferred amounts, referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs ( DAC ), are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and amortized to income in a systematic manner, based on related contract revenues or gross profits as appropriate.
24090_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	Traditional life insurance and accident and health insurance acquisition costs are being amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing future policy benefit liabilities.
24090_11_ITEM15_P46_S1	For universal life type contracts and investment contracts that include significant surrender charges or that yield significant revenues from sources other than the investment contract holders funds, the deferred contract acquisition cost amortization is matched to the recognition of gross profit.
24090_11_ITEM15_P46_S2	The effect on the DAC asset that would result from realization of unrealized gains or losses is recognized with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income in consolidated stockholders equity.
24090_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	If an internal replacement of insurance or investment contract modification substantially changes a contract as defined in current accounting guidance, then the DAC is written off immediately through income and any new deferrable costs associated with the new replacement are deferred.
24090_11_ITEM15_P47_S1	If a contract modification does not substantially change the contract, the DAC amortization on the original contract will continue and any acquisition costs associated with the related modification are immediately expensed.
24090_11_ITEM15_P48_S0	We utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance.
24090_11_ITEM15_P48_S1	The factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period.
24090_11_ITEM15_P48_S2	The factor method ensures that policies lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation.
24090_11_ITEM15_P48_S3	The factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value, provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors.
24090_11_ITEM15_P49_S0	Inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred, the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_11_ITEM15_P49_S1	Approximately 80% of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year excess commissions.
24090_11_ITEM15_P49_S2	The remaining 20% are attributed to costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new insurance business.
24090_11_ITEM15_P49_S3	Those costs generally include costs related to the production, underwriting and issuance of new business.
24090_11_ITEM15_P50_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_11_ITEM15_P50_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less the benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 30 years.
24090_11_ITEM15_P50_S2	The available premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated.
24090_11_ITEM15_P50_S3	The deferred policy acquisition costs are then evaluated over two methods utilizing reasonable assumptions and two other methods using pessimistic assumptions.
24090_11_ITEM15_P51_S0	Management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value.
24090_11_ITEM15_P51_S1	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on capitalized expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business, utilization of the factor method and annual recoverability testing.
24090_11_ITEM15_P52_S0	Deferred acquisition costs is summarized as follows:
24090_11_ITEM15_P53_S0	Cost of customer relationships acquired ( CCRA ) is established when we purchase a block of insurance.
24090_11_ITEM15_P53_S1	CCRA is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_11_ITEM15_P54_S0	We utilize various methods to determine the amount of the ending asset balance, including a static model and a dynamic model.
24090_11_ITEM15_P54_S1	Inherent in the amortization of CCRA are certain management judgments about the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_11_ITEM15_P54_S2	The assumptions used are based upon interest, mortality and lapses at the time of purchase.
24090_11_ITEM15_P55_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_11_ITEM15_P55_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less the benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next thirty years.
24090_11_ITEM15_P55_S2	The CCRA is then evaluated utilizing reasonable assumptions.
24090_11_ITEM15_P55_S3	Management believes that our CCRA and related amortization is recoverable for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
24090_11_ITEM15_P55_S4	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on estimated future results of the block and our annual recoverability testing.
24090_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	Cost of customer relationships acquired relative to purchased blocks of insurance is summarized as follows:
24090_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	Estimated amortization of cost of customer relationships acquired in each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows.
24090_11_ITEM15_P57_S1	Actual future amortization will differ from these estimates due to variances from estimated future withdrawal assumptions.
24090_11_ITEM15_P58_S0	The value of CCRA in our various acquisitions, which is included in cost of customer relationships acquired in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, was determined based on the present value of future profits discounted at annual rates ranging from 4.5% to 8.5%.
24090_11_ITEM15_P59_S0	Future policy benefit reserves for traditional life insurance and accident and health insurance contract benefits and expenses are computed using a net level premium method, with assumptions as to investment yields, dividends on participating business, mortality and withdrawals based upon our experience, modified as necessary to reflect anticipated trends and to include provisions for possible unfavorable deviations.
24090_11_ITEM15_P60_S0	The accrued account balance for non-traditional life insurance and investment contracts is computed as deposits net of withdrawals made by the contract holder, plus amounts credited based on contract specifications, less contract fees and charges assessed, plus any additional interest.
24090_11_ITEM15_P60_S1	Annuity interest crediting rates range from 3.0% to 5.5% annually.
24090_11_ITEM15_P60_S2	Benefits and expenses are charged against the account balance to recognize costs as incurred over the estimated lives of the contracts.
24090_11_ITEM15_P60_S3	Expenses include interest credited to contract account balances and benefits paid in excess of contract account balances.
24090_11_ITEM15_P61_S0	Unpaid claims on accident and health policies represent the estimated liability for benefit expenses, both reported but not paid and incurred but not reported to the Company.
24090_11_ITEM15_P61_S1	Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated using individual case basis valuations and statistical analyses.
24090_11_ITEM15_P61_S2	Those estimates are subject to the effects of trends in claim severity and frequency.
24090_11_ITEM15_P62_S0	Anticipated investment income is not considered in determining whether a premium deficiency exists with respect to short-duration contracts.
24090_11_ITEM15_P63_S0	Premium deposits accrue interest at rates ranging from 4.0% to 8.25% per annum.
24090_11_ITEM15_P63_S1	The cost of insurance is included in the premium when collected and interest is credited annually to deposit accounts.
24090_11_ITEM15_P64_S0	The development of liabilities for future policy benefits requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding mortality, morbidity, lapse, expense, and investment experience.
24090_11_ITEM15_P64_S1	These estimates are based primarily on historical experience and future expectations of mortality, morbidity, expense, persistency, and investment assumptions.
24090_11_ITEM15_P64_S2	Actual results could differ materially from estimates.
24090_11_ITEM15_P64_S3	We monitor actual experience and revise assumptions as necessary.
24090_11_ITEM15_P65_S0	At December 31, 2007, the SPLIC premium paying in force policies were converted to the Company s mainframe policy administration system and SPLIC s original computer system was discontinued, except for providing access to certain historical information.
24090_11_ITEM15_P65_S1	All in force amounts were reconciled between systems, but certain records within the paid-up block were not converted until the third quarter of 2008.
24090_11_ITEM15_P65_S2	The conversion of these paid-up records resulted in an increase in future policy benefit reserves of approximately $700,000 over the reserves that were being carried prior to conversion.
24090_11_ITEM15_P65_S3	This resulted in a decrease to 2008 net income of approximately $455,000.
24090_11_ITEM15_P66_S0	During the first quarter of 2008, the Company discovered a $796,000 overstatement of life reserves, due to the use of an incorrect reserve factor going back several years.
24090_11_ITEM15_P66_S1	The error was corrected during the first quarter of 2008, resulting in an increase to net income of $517,000.
24090_11_ITEM15_P67_S0	The Company corrected two valuation database discrepancies in 2010 that resulted in a decrease to reserves of $559,000.
24090_11_ITEM15_P67_S1	There was a value per unit error related to fully paid up policies under one plan in duration twenty-one resulting in a reserve overstatement amounting to $508,000, with approximately $475,000 related to prior years, and another plan where surrender charges were not properly recorded, which also overstated reserves by $51,000, with approximately $48,000 related to prior years.
24090_11_ITEM15_P67_S2	The correction of these errors resulted in an increase of 2010 pre-tax income of $523,000 and $339,950 increase in net income.
24090_11_ITEM15_P68_S0	Goodwill is the difference between the purchase price in a business combination and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, and is not amortized.
24090_11_ITEM15_P68_S1	Other intangible assets include various state insurance licenses, which have been determined to have indefinite useful lives and, therefore, are not amortized.
24090_11_ITEM15_P68_S2	Both goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are subject to annual impairment analyses.
24090_11_ITEM15_P69_S0	The goodwill impairment test uses a two step process as set forth under current accounting guidance.
24090_11_ITEM15_P69_S1	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
24090_11_ITEM15_P69_S2	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment.
24090_11_ITEM15_P69_S3	In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value.
24090_11_ITEM15_P69_S4	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
24090_11_ITEM15_P70_S0	Management s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations, peer company price to earnings multiples, the level of the Company s Class A common stock price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit.
24090_11_ITEM15_P70_S1	Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections.
24090_11_ITEM15_P71_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had goodwill of $12.6 million allocated to the Life Insurance segment and $4.5 million allocated to the Home Service Insurance segment.
24090_11_ITEM15_P71_S1	The Company completes its annual goodwill assessment for the individual reporting units within the Life Insurance segment and Home Service Insurance segment as of December 31 each year.
24090_11_ITEM15_P71_S2	There was no impairment of goodwill in 2010, 2009 or 2008.
24090_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	Goodwill increased by $1.2 million in 2009 due to the acquisition of ICC.
24090_11_ITEM15_P72_S1	Additional goodwill in the amount of $254,000 was recorded in 2009 related to the acquisition of ONLIC in 2008.
24090_11_ITEM15_P72_S2	This arose from an additional tax valuation allowance related to impairments on investments that existed at the acquisition dates but were not identified and recorded until 2009, within the measurement period for purchase accounting adjustments.
24090_11_ITEM15_P72_S3	In addition, goodwill was decreased by $19,000 in 2009 as a result of a policy reserve omission at the purchase date of ONLIC, which was discovered and recorded in 2009.
24090_11_ITEM15_P72_S4	This adjustment was comprised of an increase in CCRA of $326,000 and an increase in policy reserves of $307,000.
24090_11_ITEM15_P73_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company added $4.3 million of goodwill related to the acquisition of ONLIC.
24090_11_ITEM15_P73_S1	The purchase price was allocated to identifiable assets of $21.4 million (excluding goodwill) and liabilities of $16.9 million based on management s estimate, resulting in goodwill of $4.3 million.
24090_11_ITEM15_P73_S2	Adjustments to ONLIC goodwill in 2009 of $235,000 increased total goodwill from the ONLIC acquisition to $4.5 million.
24090_11_ITEM15_P73_S3	The purchase price we paid for the acquisition was $8.0 million, plus acquisition related expenses of $900,000.
24090_11_ITEM15_P74_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, participating business approximated 58.7% and 58.5%, respectively, of direct life insurance in force.
24090_11_ITEM15_P75_S0	Future policy benefits on participating policies are estimated based on net level premium reserves for death and endowment policy benefits ranging from 3% to 8%, and the cash surrender values described in such contracts.
24090_11_ITEM15_P75_S1	The scaling rate used for the 2010 portfolio ranged between 3.6% up to 5.7% over 15 years.
24090_11_ITEM15_P75_S2	The average annual rate of investment yields used in the determination of expected gross margin was 4.5% in 2009 and 6.0% in 2008.
24090_11_ITEM15_P76_S0	Earnings and dividends on participating policies are allocated based on policies in force.
24090_11_ITEM15_P77_S0	Policyholder dividends are determined based on the discretion of the Board of Directors of the policy issuing subsidiary.
24090_11_ITEM15_P77_S1	Policyholder dividends are accrued over the premium paying periods of the insurance contract.
24090_11_ITEM15_P78_S0	Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.
24090_11_ITEM15_P78_S1	Diluted earnings per share are computed under the if-converted method for convertible securities and the treasury stock method for warrants, giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock, including options, warrants and convertible/redeemable preferred stock.
24090_11_ITEM15_P78_S2	The basic and diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock are one half the earnings per share of the Class A common stock.
24090_11_ITEM15_P79_S0	In 2009, we issued 1.7 million Class A common shares for the mandatory redemption of our Company Series A Preferred Stock.
24090_11_ITEM15_P79_S1	Additionally, 10,000 shares of Class A common stock were issued upon one exercise of warrants.
24090_11_ITEM15_P79_S2	During 2009, the Company also issued 1.3 million shares of Class A common stock for the acquisition of ICC.
24090_11_ITEM15_P80_S0	In 2008, we issued 2.5 million shares of our Class A common stock for the redemption of part of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock.
24090_11_ITEM15_P80_S1	Additionally, 18,000 shares of Class A common stock were issued upon the exercise of warrants.
24090_11_ITEM15_P81_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:
24090_11_ITEM15_P82_S0	In 2010 and 2009, certain warrants associated with our Convertible Preferred Stock became dilutive.
24090_11_ITEM15_P82_S1	As a result, the diluted weighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding for 2010 were 48,688,000 and for 2009 were 47,556,000.
24090_11_ITEM15_P82_S2	Total diluted weighted average shares were 49,690,000 and 48,558,000 for 2010 and 2009, respectively.
24090_11_ITEM15_P82_S3	Diluted earnings per Class A share were unchanged from basic at $0.32.
24090_11_ITEM15_P83_S0	In 2008, the warrants associated with our Convertible Preferred Stock were anti-dilutive.
24090_11_ITEM15_P83_S1	Total weighted average shares outstanding for 2008 were 44,367,000.
24090_11_ITEM15_P84_S0	The Series A-1 and A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock that was outstanding during 2009 and 2008 was anti-dilutive because the amount of the dividend and accretion of deferred issuance costs and discounts for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 per Class A common stock share obtainable on conversion exceeds basic income per share available to common stockholders.
24090_11_ITEM15_P85_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
24090_11_ITEM15_P85_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered.
24090_11_ITEM15_P86_S0	A deferred tax asset is recorded only if a determination is made that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax treatment on which the deferred tax asset depends will be sustained in the event of an audit.
24090_11_ITEM15_P86_S1	These determinations inherently involve management s judgment.
24090_11_ITEM15_P86_S2	In addition, the Company must record a tax valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
24090_11_ITEM15_P86_S3	This valuation allowance is in essence a contra account to the deferred tax asset.
24090_11_ITEM15_P86_S4	Management must determine the portion of the deferred tax asset and resulting tax benefit that may not be realized based upon judgment of expected outcomes.
24090_11_ITEM15_P87_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_11_ITEM15_P87_S1	Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position.
24090_11_ITEM15_P88_S0	The table below details the Company s tax valuation allowance in deferred income taxes payable.
24090_11_ITEM15_P89_S0	Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
24090_11_ITEM15_P89_S1	Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to thirty years.
24090_11_ITEM15_P90_S0	We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated life of the improvements.
24090_11_ITEM15_P90_S1	The Company has no capital leases.
24090_11_ITEM15_P91_S0	Following is a summary of property and equipment:
24090_11_ITEM15_P92_S0	Reinsurance recoverable includes expected reimbursements for policyholder claim amounts in excess of the Company s retention, as well as profit sharing and experience refund accruals.
24090_11_ITEM15_P92_S1	Reinsurance recoverable is reduced for estimated uncollectible amounts, if any.
24090_11_ITEM15_P93_S0	Reinsurance premiums, losses and adjustment expenses are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts.
24090_11_ITEM15_P93_S1	The cost of reinsurance related to long duration contracts is accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies.
24090_11_ITEM15_P93_S2	The cost of reinsurance related to short duration contracts is accounted for over the coverage period.
24090_11_ITEM15_P93_S3	Profit-sharing and similar adjustable provisions are accrued based on the experience of the underlying policies.
24090_11_ITEM15_P94_S0	The Company considers as cash equivalents all securities whose duration does not exceed 90 days at the date of acquisition.
24090_11_ITEM15_P95_S0	Depreciation on most property and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis using estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years.
24090_11_ITEM15_P95_S1	Building improvements are depreciated over the estimated lives of thirty years.
24090_11_ITEM15_P96_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
24090_11_ITEM15_P96_S1	Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
24090_11_ITEM15_P97_S0	The Company recorded reclassifications related to DAC amounts capitalized and amortized to properly reflect the amount used to develop the DAC asset balance and to provide consistent presentation with the current year.
24090_11_ITEM15_P97_S1	We recorded an increase to DAC capitalized of $3.5 million and $5.1 million and an increase in amortization for the same amount for 2009 and 2008, respectively.
24090_11_ITEM15_P98_S0	In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) updated Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 820, requiring additional disclosures about fair value measurements regarding transfers between fair value categories as well as purchases, sales, issuances and settlements related to fair value measurements of financial instruments with non-observable inputs.
24090_11_ITEM15_P98_S1	This update was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009 except for disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of financial instruments with non-observable inputs, which are effective for years beginning after December 15, 2010.
24090_11_ITEM15_P98_S2	The additional disclosures required by this update are included herein in the note on fair value measurements upon adoption.
24090_11_ITEM15_P98_S3	The additional disclosures did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
24090_11_ITEM15_P99_S0	No. 09-G, Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts ( Issue 09-G ).
24090_11_ITEM15_P99_S1	Issue 09-G clarifies what costs should be deferred by insurance companies when issuing or renewing insurance contracts.
24090_11_ITEM15_P99_S2	The EITF concluded that only costs incurred in the acquisition of new and renewal contracts that are: 1) incremental direct costs of a successful contract acquisition, 2) portions of employees salaries and benefits directly related to time spent performing specified acquisition activities for a contract that has actually been acquired, 3) other costs directly related to the specified acquisition activities that would not have occurred otherwise, and 4) advertising costs that meet the capitalization criteria in other issued accounting guidance would be capitalizable as deferred acquisition costs.
24090_11_ITEM15_P100_S0	Issue 09-G will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2011.
24090_11_ITEM15_P100_S1	The Company is currently reviewing this guidance and our current deferral policies to determine the impact this consensus may have on our consolidated financial statements.
24090_11_ITEM15_P101_S0	Effective July 1, 2009, the FASB s ASC became the single official source of authoritative, nongovernmental generally accepted accounting principles.
24090_11_ITEM15_P101_S1	The historical U.S. GAAP hierarchy was eliminated and the ASC became the only level of authoritative U.S. GAAP, other than guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
24090_11_ITEM15_P101_S2	Our accounting policies were not affected by the conversion to ASC.
24090_11_ITEM15_P101_S3	However, references to specific accounting standards in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements have been changed to refer to the appropriate section of ASC.
24090_11_ITEM15_P102_S0	As of January 1, 2008, the Company adopted Fair Value Measurement Accounting.
24090_11_ITEM15_P102_S1	This guidance defined fair value, established a framework for measuring fair value and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements.
24090_11_ITEM15_P102_S2	The adoption of this Fair Value guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
24090_11_ITEM15_P102_S3	Additionally, on January 1, 2008, the Company elected the partial adoption of accounting guidance that amended the Fair Value guidance to allow an entity to delay the application of this Statement until January 1, 2009 for certain non-financial assets and liabilities.
24090_11_ITEM15_P102_S4	Under the provisions of the guidance, we delayed the application for fair value measurements used in the impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and eligible non-financial assets and liabilities included within a business combination.
24090_11_ITEM15_P102_S5	On October 10, 2008, new accounting guidance was issued to clarify the application of fair value measurements of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active.
24090_11_ITEM15_P102_S6	This clarifying guidance became effective upon issuance.
24090_11_ITEM15_P102_S7	The adoption had no impact on our results of operations or financial position.
24090_11_ITEM15_P103_S0	On January 1, 2009, we adopted, without material impact on our consolidated financial statements, the provisions of the fair value measurement accounting standard related to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which include those measured at fair value in goodwill impairment testing, indefinite-lived intangible assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment, nonfinancial long-lived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment, asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value, and those initially measured at fair value in a business combination.
24090_11_ITEM15_P104_S0	In April 2009, the FASB further updated the fair value measurement standard to provide additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased.
24090_11_ITEM15_P104_S1	This update re-emphasizes that, regardless of market conditions, the fair value measurement is an exit price concept as defined in the original standard.
24090_11_ITEM15_P104_S2	It clarifies and includes additional factors to consider in determining whether there has been a significant decrease in market activity for an asset or liability and provides additional clarification on estimating fair value when the market activity for an asset or liability has declined significantly.
24090_11_ITEM15_P104_S3	The scope of this update does not include assets and liabilities measured under Level 1 inputs.
24090_11_ITEM15_P104_S4	We adopted this update on June 30, 2009 prospectively to all fair value measurements as appropriate without material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
24090_11_ITEM15_P104_S5	See Note 3 for additional disclosures about fair value measurement.
24090_11_ITEM15_P105_S0	In August 2009, the FASB further updated the fair value measurement guidance to clarify how an entity should measure liabilities at fair value.
24090_11_ITEM15_P105_S1	The update reaffirms fair value is based on an orderly transaction between market participants, even though liabilities are infrequently transferred due to contractual or other legal restrictions.
24090_11_ITEM15_P105_S2	However, quoted prices for identical liabilities traded in the active market should be used when available.
24090_11_ITEM15_P105_S3	When quoted prices are not available, the quoted price of the identical liability traded as an asset, quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities traded as an asset, or another valuation approach should be used.
24090_11_ITEM15_P105_S4	This update also clarifies that restrictions preventing the transfer of a liability should not be considered as a separate input or adjustment in the measurement of fair value.
24090_11_ITEM15_P105_S5	We adopted the provisions of this update for fair value measurements of liabilities effective October 1, 2009, and its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
24090_11_ITEM15_P106_S0	As of January 1, 2008, the Company adopted new accounting guidance that provided an option, on specified election dates, to report selected financial assets and liabilities, including insurance contracts, at fair value.
24090_11_ITEM15_P106_S1	Subsequent changes in fair value for designated items are reported in income in the current period.
24090_11_ITEM15_P106_S2	The adoption did not impact our consolidated financial statements, as no items were elected for measurement at fair value upon initial adoption.
24090_11_ITEM15_P106_S3	We continue to evaluate eligible financial assets and liabilities on their election dates.
24090_11_ITEM15_P106_S4	Any future elections will be disclosed in accordance with the provisions outlined in the accounting guidance.
24090_11_ITEM15_P107_S0	On June 30, 2009, in our consolidated financial statements, we adopted the provisions of a new accounting standard relating to subsequent events, which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.
24090_11_ITEM15_P107_S1	The standard defines two types of subsequent events: recognized subsequent events, which provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date, and nonrecognized subsequent events, which provide evidence about conditions that did not exist as of the balance sheet date, but arose after that date.
24090_11_ITEM15_P107_S2	Recognized subsequent events are required to be recognized in the financial statements, and certain nonrecognized subsequent events are required to be disclosed.
24090_11_ITEM15_P107_S3	The Standard also requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events.
24090_11_ITEM15_P108_S0	On June 30, 2009, we adopted an update to accounting standards for disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments, which requires publicly-traded companies to provide disclosures on the fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements.
24090_11_ITEM15_P109_S0	On January 1, 2009, we adopted an update to existing accounting standards for business combinations.
24090_11_ITEM15_P109_S1	The update, which retains the underlying concepts of the original standard in that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting, changes the method of applying the acquisition method in a number of ways.
24090_11_ITEM15_P109_S2	Acquisition costs are no longer considered part of the fair value of an acquisition and will generally be expensed as incurred, noncontrolling interests are valued at fair value at the acquisition date, in-process research and development is recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date, restructuring costs associated with a business combination are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date, and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense.
24090_11_ITEM15_P110_S0	In April 2009, the FASB issued a further update in relation to accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies, which amends the previous guidance to require contingent assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination to be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if fair value can be reasonably estimated during the measurement period.
24090_11_ITEM15_P110_S1	If fair value cannot be reasonably estimated during the measurement period, the contingent asset or liability would be recognized in accordance with standards and guidance on accounting for contingencies and reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss.
24090_11_ITEM15_P110_S2	Further, this update eliminated the specific subsequent accounting guidance for contingent assets and liabilities, without significantly revising the original guidance.
24090_11_ITEM15_P110_S3	However, contingent consideration arrangements of an acquiree assumed by the acquirer in a business combination would still be initially and subsequently measured at fair value.
24090_11_ITEM15_P110_S4	These updates are effective for all business acquisitions occurring on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008.
24090_11_ITEM15_P110_S5	We adopted the provisions of these updates for business combinations with an acquisition date on or after January 1, 2009 and these adoptions did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
24090_11_ITEM15_P111_S0	There were no noncontrolling interests acquired in the ICC acquisition.
24090_11_ITEM15_P112_S0	The Company has assessed, based upon the information available, the Affordable Care Act, as passed by the U.S. Congress in the first quarter of 2010.
24090_11_ITEM15_P112_S1	The Company has considered its medical and dental plans provided for employees, agents and retirees.
24090_11_ITEM15_P112_S2	While the Company will incur additional costs associated with the implementation of this Act, it does not believe these costs or ongoing costs associated with this Act will have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.
24090_11_ITEM15_P113_S0	The Company does not provide a separate prescription drug plan to its retirees.
24090_11_ITEM15_P113_S1	In addition, the Company does not sell any medical insurance or prescription drug coverage.
24090_11_ITEM15_P113_S2	However, the Company does sell dental and vision insurance but believes that the impact of this Act is immaterial to these products.
24090_11_ITEM15_P113_S3	The Company will continue to assess the information contained in this Act as additional guidance becomes available and as additional implications are understood or clarified.
24090_11_ITEM15_P114_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was passed by the U.S. Congress in July of 2010.
24090_11_ITEM15_P114_S1	This Act focuses on financial reform, specifically changes to derivative regulation, regulatory framework for executive pay, corporate governance, investor protection, bonus clawback provisions, mortgage reform, and numerous other issues.
24090_11_ITEM15_P114_S2	The Company will continue to assess the information contained in this Act as additional guidance becomes available and as additional implications are clarified.
24090_11_ITEM15_P114_S3	The Company expects that additional disclosures may be required and additional costs may be associated with this Act.
24090_11_ITEM15_P114_S4	However, the Company does not believe they will have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.
24090_11_ITEM15_P115_S0	Financial stability and the prevention of capital erosion are important investment considerations for the Company.
24090_11_ITEM15_P116_S0	A primary investment goal is the conservation of assets due to the long-term nature of a significant portion of our liabilities.
24090_11_ITEM15_P116_S1	The Company invests primarily in fixed maturity securities, which totaled 84.6% of total investments and cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2010.
24090_11_ITEM15_P116_S2	Holdings in high quality fixed maturity securities rated A or higher by Standard Poor s, Inc. totaled 85.6% of investment holdings in this category, reflecting the conservative investment philosophy of the Company.
24090_11_ITEM15_P117_S0	The cost, gross unrealized gains and losses and fair value of investments in fixed maturities and equity securities, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, are as follows:
24090_11_ITEM15_P118_S0	For investments of available-for-sale fixed maturities that have unrealized losses as of December 31, 2010, the cost, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer and fair value are as follows:
24090_11_ITEM15_P119_S0	As of December 31, 2010, there are no unrealized losses on the Company s equity securities.
24090_11_ITEM15_P120_S0	The largest group of available-for-sale fixed maturities in a gross unrealized loss position for more than 12 months is primarily the municipal bonds acquired in the acquisition of SPLIC in 2004, and under purchase GAAP accounting, have a higher cost basis than historical cost.
24090_11_ITEM15_P120_S1	These premiums are being amortized to net investment income.
24090_11_ITEM15_P120_S2	Management has completed its assessment of other-than-temporary impairment of these securities.
24090_11_ITEM15_P120_S3	Based on our evaluation of the credit worthiness of the issuers and because we do not intend to sell the investments, nor is it likely that we would be required to sell these investments, before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, none of the unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporary.
24090_11_ITEM15_P121_S0	We monitor all debt and equity securities on an on-going basis relative to changes in credit ratings, market prices, earnings trends and financial performance, in addition to specific region or industry reviews.
24090_11_ITEM15_P121_S1	Our impairment review, in accordance with current guidance, is performed by the Company at each reporting date and management uses its best judgment to decide if impairment is other-than-temporary.
24090_11_ITEM15_P121_S2	We determine other-than-temporary impairment by reviewing relevant evidence related to the specific security issuer, as well as our intent to sell the security or whether we more likely than not will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery.
24090_11_ITEM15_P122_S0	All fixed maturity securities sold in 2010 were sold at a gain or a minimal loss.
24090_11_ITEM15_P122_S1	All securities with a market price below 90% of par were segregated and reviewed as of December 31, 2010 based upon the items above for other-than-temporary impairment.
24090_11_ITEM15_P123_S0	For investments of available-for-sale fixed maturities and equity securities that have unrealized losses as of December 31, 2009, the cost, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer and fair value are as follows:
24090_11_ITEM15_P124_S0	The amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturities at December 31, 2010 by contractual maturity are shown below.
24090_11_ITEM15_P125_S0	Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
24090_11_ITEM15_P126_S0	The securities not due at a single maturity date include mortgage-backed obligations of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises and corporate securities.
24090_11_ITEM15_P127_S0	The Company had no investments in any one entity, excluding U.S. Government agencies, that exceeded 10% of stockholders equity at December 31, 2010.
24090_11_ITEM15_P127_S1	In addition, there were no investments that were non-income producing for the year ended December 31, 2010.
24090_11_ITEM15_P128_S0	Major categories of net investment income are summarized as follows:
24090_11_ITEM15_P129_S0	Proceeds and gross realized gains and losses from sales of fixed maturities available-for-sale for 2010, 2009 and 2008 are summarized as follows:
24090_11_ITEM15_P130_S0	Certain securities were sold during 2010 from a tax planning perspective and due to statutory reporting considerations related to non-rated securities.
24090_11_ITEM15_P131_S0	In 2009, the Company sold bonds to capture realized gains and reinvest in higher yielding securities of the same quality based upon market changes.
24090_11_ITEM15_P131_S1	During 2008, the Company sold three fixed maturity securities in SPFIC to fund payment of claims related to Hurricane Gustav.
24090_11_ITEM15_P131_S2	No securities were sold from the held-to-maturity portfolio in 2010, 2009 or 2008.
24090_11_ITEM15_P132_S0	Proceeds and gross realized gains and losses from sales of equity securities for 2010, 2009 and 2008 are summarized as follows:
24090_11_ITEM15_P133_S0	In 2010 and 2009, the Company sold holdings of equity mutual funds that were previously impaired in 2008, generating realized capital gains for financial reporting purposes, of $6.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively, but realized losses for tax purposes.
24090_11_ITEM15_P133_S1	The tax losses will be carried back to recover taxes paid on gains in prior years.
24090_11_ITEM15_P134_S0	Realized gains (losses) are as follows:
24090_11_ITEM15_P135_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
24090_11_ITEM15_P135_S1	We hold fixed maturity and equity securities that are carried at fair value.
24090_11_ITEM15_P136_S0	Fair value measurements are generally based upon observable and unobservable inputs.
24090_11_ITEM15_P136_S1	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.
24090_11_ITEM15_P136_S2	We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
24090_11_ITEM15_P137_S0	All assets and liabilities carried at fair value are required to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
24090_11_ITEM15_P138_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
24090_11_ITEM15_P139_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose inputs or whose significant value drivers are observable.
24090_11_ITEM15_P140_S0	Level 3 Instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable.
24090_11_ITEM15_P141_S0	Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as U.S. Treasury securities and publicly traded mutual fund investments.
24090_11_ITEM15_P142_S0	Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued by independent pricing services or broker quotes.
24090_11_ITEM15_P142_S1	These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various inputs, such as interest rates, credit spreads and foreign exchange rates for the underlying financial instruments.
24090_11_ITEM15_P142_S2	All significant inputs are observable, or derived from observable information in the marketplace or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
24090_11_ITEM15_P143_S0	Financial instruments in this category primarily include corporate fixed maturity securities, U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise securities, municipal securities and certain mortgage and asset-backed securities.
24090_11_ITEM15_P144_S0	Level 3 is comprised of financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on non-binding broker prices utilizing significant inputs not based on, or corroborated by, readily available market information.
24090_11_ITEM15_P144_S1	This category consists of two private placement mortgage-backed securities where we cannot corroborate the significant valuation inputs with market observable data.
24090_11_ITEM15_P145_S0	The following table sets forth our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the date indicated:
24090_11_ITEM15_P146_S0	At December 31, 2010, the fixed maturities, valued using a third-party pricing source, totaled $562.4 million for Level 2 assets and comprised 97.7% of total reported fair value.
24090_11_ITEM15_P146_S1	Fair values for Level 3 assets are based upon unadjusted broker quotes that are non-binding.
24090_11_ITEM15_P146_S2	The valuations are reviewed and validated quarterly through random testing by comparisons to separate pricing models, other third party pricing services, and back tested to recent trades.
24090_11_ITEM15_P146_S3	For the period ended December 31, 2010, there were no material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine fair values, and no broker or third party prices were changed from the values received.
24090_11_ITEM15_P147_S0	Fair values of these securities are based upon quoted market price and are classified as Level 1 assets.
24090_11_ITEM15_P148_S0	The fair values for short-term investments are determined using a third-party pricing source.
24090_11_ITEM15_P148_S1	These assets are classified as Level 2.
24090_11_ITEM15_P149_S0	Fair value of our warrants are based upon industry standard models that consider various observable inputs and are classified as Level 2.
24090_11_ITEM15_P150_S0	The following table presents additional information about fixed maturity securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and for which we have utilized significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs to determine fair value:
24090_11_ITEM15_P151_S0	We review the fair value hierarchy classifications each reporting period.
24090_11_ITEM15_P152_S0	Changes in the observability of the valuation attributes may result in a reclassification of certain financial assets.
24090_11_ITEM15_P152_S1	Such reclassifications, if any, are reported as transfers in and out of Level 3 at the beginning fair value for the reporting period in which the changes occur.
24090_11_ITEM15_P153_S0	Estimates of fair values are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market prices and information about the financial instrument.
24090_11_ITEM15_P153_S1	The estimated fair values of financial instruments presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company might realize in actual market transactions.
24090_11_ITEM15_P153_S2	The carrying amount and fair value for the financial assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at each year-end were as follows:
24090_11_ITEM15_P154_S0	Fair values for fixed income securities are based on quoted market prices.
24090_11_ITEM15_P154_S1	In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other assumptions, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.
24090_11_ITEM15_P155_S0	Mortgage loans are secured principally by residential properties and commercial properties.
24090_11_ITEM15_P155_S1	Weighted average interest rates for these loans were approximately 6.7% per year, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, with maturities ranging from one to thirty years.
24090_11_ITEM15_P155_S2	Management estimated the fair value using an annual interest rate of 6.25% at December 31, 2010 and 2009.
24090_11_ITEM15_P156_S0	The fair value of the Company s liabilities under annuity contract policies were estimated using discounted cash flows at a risk free rate plus a component for non-performance risk and interest rate risk.
24090_11_ITEM15_P156_S1	The fair value of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in the overall management of interest rate risk, which seeks to minimize exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment maturities with amounts due under insurance contracts.
24090_11_ITEM15_P157_S0	Policy loans have a weighted average annual interest rate of 7.7% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and have no specified maturity dates.
24090_11_ITEM15_P157_S1	The aggregate fair value of policy loans approximates the carrying value reflected on the consolidated balance sheet.
24090_11_ITEM15_P157_S2	These loans typically carry an interest rate that is tied to the crediting rate applied to the related policy and contract reserves.
24090_11_ITEM15_P158_S0	Policy loans are an integral part of the life insurance policies that we have in force and cannot be valued separately and are not marketable; therefore, a fair value is not calculated.
24090_11_ITEM15_P159_S0	For cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income, reinsurance recoverable, other assets, federal income tax payable and receivable, dividend accumulations, commissions payable, amounts held on deposit, and other liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of such financial instruments.
24090_11_ITEM15_P160_S0	Various assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit reserves of life insurance include the following: a) valuation interest rates from 4% to 9% per year; b) mortality assumptions are from the 1955 to 1960, 1965 to 1970, 1975 to 1980 and 2001 Select and Ultimate mortality tables; and c) withdrawals are based primarily on actual historical termination rates.
24090_11_ITEM15_P161_S0	The following table presents information on changes in the liability for life, accident and health and property policy and contract claims for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
24090_11_ITEM15_P162_S0	The favorable development in 2010 of $1,187,000 was primarily related to SPLIC incurred but not reported ( IBNR ) claims at December 31, 2009, which was over accrued by approximately $979,000.
24090_11_ITEM15_P162_S1	The IBNR going forward has been adjusted to account for the better claims experience trending.
24090_11_ITEM15_P163_S0	The favorable development in 2009 for prior year claims was primarily from SPLIC and SPFIC.
24090_11_ITEM15_P163_S1	SPLIC s IBNR claims were greater at December 31, 2008 than claims incurred during 2009.
24090_11_ITEM15_P163_S2	On prior year claims, SPFIC had favorable development on Hurricane Ike, which occurred in 2008, and litigation from Hurricane Katrina, which occurred in 2005.
24090_11_ITEM15_P164_S0	SPLIC had higher death claims in 2008 than in prior years, which caused the adverse development.
24090_11_ITEM15_P164_S1	The unfavorable claims development of $305,000 in 2008 was primarily the result of SPLIC receiving prior year claims in excess of liabilities established.
24090_11_ITEM15_P165_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company reinsures portions of certain policies that we underwrite to limit disproportionate risks.
24090_11_ITEM15_P165_S1	During 2010 and 2009, we retained varying amounts of individual insurance up to a maximum retention of $100,000 on any life.
24090_11_ITEM15_P165_S2	The Company also reinsures 100% of our accidental death benefit rider coverage.
24090_11_ITEM15_P165_S3	Catastrophe reinsurance is in place for our property policies.
24090_11_ITEM15_P165_S4	In 2010 and 2009, this reinsurance provided $10,000,000 of coverage above a $500,000 deductible.
24090_11_ITEM15_P166_S0	Our health insurance policies are substantially all reinsured on a 100% coinsurance basis.
24090_11_ITEM15_P166_S1	We remain contingently liable to the extent that the reinsuring companies cannot meet their obligations under these reinsurance treaties.
24090_11_ITEM15_P167_S0	Our amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and reserves ceded to reinsurers.
24090_11_ITEM15_P167_S1	We obtain reinsurance from multiple reinsurers, and we monitor concentration as well as financial strength ratings of our principal reinsurers.
24090_11_ITEM15_P167_S2	The ratings by A.M. Best Company range from B (Good) to A (Superior).
24090_11_ITEM15_P168_S0	To protect our position, we have established and funded a trust to cover the contingent liabilities related to accident and health reinsurance ceded to Texas International Life Insurance Company, which represents $5.1 million of the $9.7 million of reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2010.
24090_11_ITEM15_P169_S0	Assumed and ceded life reinsurance activity as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 is summarized as follows:
24090_11_ITEM15_P170_S0	The Company s reinsurance recoveries on ceded reinsurance were $9.7 million in 2010 and $11.6 million in 2009.
24090_11_ITEM15_P170_S1	Premiums and claims and surrenders assumed and ceded for all lines of business for these years are summarized as follows:
24090_11_ITEM15_P171_S0	SPFIC has catastrophe reinsurance that covers the first event in excess of a $500,000 deductible up to $10.0 million.
24090_11_ITEM15_P171_S1	In consideration for a reinstatement premium, second event coverage is provided in excess of a $500,000 deductible up to $10.0 million.
24090_11_ITEM15_P171_S2	The annual premium was $1,130,000, $1,075,000 and $750,000 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
24090_11_ITEM15_P171_S3	Also in 2008, SPFIC paid $478,000 in second and third event coverage because of the occurrence of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike.
24090_11_ITEM15_P172_S0	The two classes of our common stock are equal in all respects, except (a) each Class A share receives twice the cash dividends paid on a per share basis to the Class B common stock; and (b) the Class B common stock elects a simple majority of the Board of Directors of Citizens and the Class A common stock elects the remaining directors.
24090_11_ITEM15_P173_S0	The table below shows the combined total of all of our insurance subsidiaries capital and surplus and net income (loss) for life insurance operations and property insurance operations, although these amounts are not all available as dividends to Citizens, Inc., because only CICA is directly owned by Citizens, Inc.
24090_11_ITEM15_P173_S1	All other subsidiaries are owned by CICA.
24090_11_ITEM15_P174_S0	Generally, the net assets of the insurance subsidiaries available for transfer to their immediate parent are limited to the greater of the subsidiary net gain from operations during the preceding year or 10% of the subsidiary net statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_11_ITEM15_P174_S1	Under these practices, total surplus at December 31, 2010 was $47.5 million and net gain from operations was $7.4 million for CICA.
24090_11_ITEM15_P174_S2	Based upon statutory net gain from operations and surplus of CICA as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, a dividend of approximately $7.4 million could be paid to the Company without prior regulatory approval in 2011.
24090_11_ITEM15_P174_S3	Payments of dividends in excess of such amounts would generally require approval by regulatory authorities.
24090_11_ITEM15_P175_S0	CICA, CNLIC, SPLIC, SPFIC, and ICIC have calculated their risk based capital ( RBC ) in accordance with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Model Rule and the RBC rules as adopted by their respective states of domicile.
24090_11_ITEM15_P175_S1	All insurance subsidiaries exceeded RBC minimum levels at December 31, 2010.
24090_11_ITEM15_P176_S0	In July 2004, the Company completed a private placement of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series A-1 Preferred ) to four unaffiliated institutional investors.
24090_11_ITEM15_P176_S1	We also issued to the investors warrants to purchase shares of our Class A common stock, at an exercise price of $6.95 per share, and unit warrants to purchase Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series A-2 Preferred ).
24090_11_ITEM15_P176_S2	The conversion, exercise and redemption prices, along with the number of shares and warrants, were adjusted for stock dividends paid on December 31, 2004 and on December 30, 2005.
24090_11_ITEM15_P177_S0	On July 13, 2009, the Company converted all of its outstanding Series A-1 and Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock into Class A common shares in accordance with the mandatory redemption provision of the preferred shareholder agreement dated July 12, 2004.
24090_11_ITEM15_P177_S1	The total amount of Class A common shares issued as part of the conversion was 1,706,682, inclusive of pro rata dividends due through the conversion date.
24090_11_ITEM15_P178_S0	There are outstanding warrants to purchase the Company s stock at prices ranging from $6.95 to $7.93, which were issued to investors of the Class A-1 and A-2 preferred stock.
24090_11_ITEM15_P178_S1	There are 1,022,471 warrants to purchase stock that expire, if not exercised, on July 12, 2011 and 178,969 that expire, if not exercised, in the third quarter of 2012.
24090_11_ITEM15_P178_S2	The fair value of the warrants is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is classified as a liability on the balance sheet in the amount of $1.6 million and $1.8 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
24090_11_ITEM15_P178_S3	The change in fair value of warrants is reported as a component of revenue in the income statement.
24090_11_ITEM15_P178_S4	The change in fair value of warrants caused an increase in revenues of $0.2 million and $3.2 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and a decrease in revenue of $2.7 million in 2008.
24090_11_ITEM15_P179_S0	We have committed to the following contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 with the payments due by the period indicated below:
24090_11_ITEM15_P180_S0	Operating lease expense was $542,000, $591,000 and $628,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
24090_11_ITEM15_P181_S0	The payments related to the future policy benefits and policy claims payable reflected in the table above have been projected utilizing assumptions based upon our historical experience and anticipated future experience.
24090_11_ITEM15_P182_S0	We are a defendant in a lawsuit filed on August 6, 1999 in the Texas District Court, Austin, Texas, now styled Delia Bolanos Andrade, et al., Plaintiffs, v. Citizens Insurance Company of America, et al., Defendants in which a class was originally certified by the trial court and reversed by the Texas Supreme Court in 2007 with an order to the trial court to conduct further proceedings consistent with its ruling.
24090_11_ITEM15_P182_S1	The underlying lawsuit alleged that certain life insurance policies CICA made available to non-U.S. residents, when combined with a policy feature that allowed certain cash benefits to be assigned to two non-U.S. trusts for the purpose of accumulating ownership of our Class A common stock, along with allowing the policyholders to make additional contributions to the trusts, were actually offers and sales of securities that occurred in Texas by unregistered dealers in violation of the Texas securities laws.
24090_11_ITEM15_P182_S2	The remedy sought was rescission and return of the insurance premium payments.
24090_11_ITEM15_P182_S3	On December 9, 2009, the trial court denied the recertification of the class after conducting additional proceedings in accordance with the Texas Supreme Court s ruling.
24090_11_ITEM15_P182_S4	The remaining plaintiffs must now proceed individually, and not as a class, if they intend to pursue their cases against us.
24090_11_ITEM15_P182_S5	We intend to maintain a vigorous defense in any remaining proceedings.
24090_11_ITEM15_P183_S0	In addition to the legal proceeding described above, we may from time to time be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our future, current and past business operations, including, but not limited to:
24090_11_ITEM15_P184_S0	disputes relating to businesses acquired and operated by us.
24090_11_ITEM15_P185_S0	In the absence of countervailing considerations, we would expect to defend any such claims vigorously.
24090_11_ITEM15_P185_S1	However, in doing so, we could incur significant defense costs, including not only attorneys fees and other direct litigation costs, but also the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_11_ITEM15_P185_S2	If we suffer an adverse judgment as a result of any claim, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_11_ITEM15_P186_S0	The Company has three reportable segments: Life Insurance, Home Service Insurance, and Other Non-Insurance Enterprises.
24090_11_ITEM15_P186_S1	The accounting policies of the segments are in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
24090_11_ITEM15_P187_S0	We evaluate profit and loss performance based on U.S. GAAP net income before federal income taxes for its three reportable segments.
24090_11_ITEM15_P188_S0	The measurement of segment profit and loss and segment assets do not include material transactions between segments.
24090_11_ITEM15_P188_S1	The Company has no reportable differences between segments and consolidated operations.
24090_11_ITEM15_P189_S0	The table below summarizes assets by segment.
24090_11_ITEM15_P190_S0	Major categories of earned premiums are summarized as follows:
24090_11_ITEM15_P191_S0	The following table sets forth the Company s total yearly earned premium from geographic area for the years indicated:
24090_11_ITEM15_P192_S0	Our federal income tax expense was $4.1 million, $3.3 million and $3.1 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
24090_11_ITEM15_P192_S1	This represents effective tax rates of 20.9%, 15.8% and 24.7%, respectively.
24090_11_ITEM15_P192_S2	In 2009, $2.8 million of the valuation allowance established in 2008 for the OTTI on mutual funds was released as a reduction in tax expense.
24090_11_ITEM15_P192_S3	This release related to the mutual funds that were sold in 2009 and generated realized capital gains in 2009.
24090_11_ITEM15_P192_S4	Additionally, $2.7 million of the valuation allowance established in 2008 was released as an increase to other comprehensive income ( OCI ).
24090_11_ITEM15_P192_S5	This release was related to the increase in the fair value during 2009 of the mutual funds still owned at December 31, 2009.
24090_11_ITEM15_P192_S6	An additional valuation allowance was set up for $254,000 related to additional declines in ONLIC investments.
24090_11_ITEM15_P192_S7	This amount was added to goodwill.
24090_11_ITEM15_P193_S0	During 2010, most of the mutual funds owned at December 31, 2009 were sold.
24090_11_ITEM15_P193_S1	Primarily due to this event, a tax valuation allowance was no longer required at December 31, 2010 and the $2.5 million allowance was released as a reduction in tax expense.
24090_11_ITEM15_P193_S2	Additionally, $1.9 million of the valuation allowance in OCI was released as a reduction in income tax expense, since the mutual funds that the allowance related to had been sold.
24090_11_ITEM15_P193_S3	The total tax expense reduction from the release of the valuation allowances in 2010 was $4.3 million.
24090_11_ITEM15_P194_S0	In 2008, a valuation allowance of $6.9 million was established for the OTTI recorded in 2008 related to the Company s stock mutual funds.
24090_11_ITEM15_P194_S1	Additionally, a valuation allowance of $804,000 was established for securities acquired in the ONLIC acquisition.
24090_11_ITEM15_P195_S0	The table below summarizes the changes in the valuation allowance.
24090_11_ITEM15_P196_S0	A reconciliation of federal income tax expense computed by applying the federal income tax rate of 35% in 2010, 2009 and 2008 to income (loss) before federal income tax expense is as follows:
24090_11_ITEM15_P197_S0	A summary of the changes in the components of deferred federal income taxes is as follows:
24090_11_ITEM15_P198_S0	Some prior year balances were reclassified to conform to the groupings presented in 2010.
24090_11_ITEM15_P199_S0	A summary of the changes in the components of deferred federal and state income taxes is as follows:
24090_11_ITEM15_P200_S0	The Company and our subsidiaries had net operating losses at December 31, 2010 available to offset future taxable income of approximately $12.2 million, expiring at various times through 2029.
24090_11_ITEM15_P200_S1	A portion of the net operating loss carryforward is subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
24090_11_ITEM15_P201_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we determined that as a result of our income, projected future income, tax planning strategies, and the nature of the items from which the deferred tax assets are derived, other than assets for which OTTI was recorded, it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized.
24090_11_ITEM15_P202_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company had accumulated approximately $3,291,000 in our policyholders surplus account.
24090_11_ITEM15_P202_S1	This is a special memorandum tax account into which certain amounts not previously taxed, under prior tax laws, were accumulated.
24090_11_ITEM15_P202_S2	No new additions are expected to be made to this account.
24090_11_ITEM15_P202_S3	Federal income taxes will become payable thereon at the then current tax rate (a) when and if distributions to shareholders, other than stock dividends and other limited exceptions, are made in excess of the accumulated previously taxed income; or (b) when a company ceases to be a life insurance company as defined by the Internal Revenue Code and such termination is not due to another life insurance company acquiring its assets in a nontaxable transaction.
24090_11_ITEM15_P203_S0	We do not anticipate any transactions that would cause any part of this amount to become taxable.
24090_11_ITEM15_P203_S1	However, should the balance at December 31, 2010 become taxable, the tax computed at present rates would be approximately $1,152,000.
24090_11_ITEM15_P204_S0	There are no uncertain tax positions for the year ended December 31, 2010; therefore, we did not accrue any interest or penalties related to these items.
24090_11_ITEM15_P205_S0	The Company s Federal income tax return is filed on a consolidated basis with the following entities:
24090_11_ITEM15_P206_S0	CICA Life Insurance Company of America Security Plan Life Insurance Company Security Plan Fire Insurance Company Computing Technologies, Inc.

24090_11_ITEM15_P207_S1	Integrity Capital Insurance Company files a separate return.
24090_11_ITEM15_P208_S0	The method of allocation among companies is subject to a written tax sharing agreement, approved by the Board of Directors, whereby allocation is made primarily on a separate return basis with current credit for any net operating losses or other items utilized in the consolidated tax return.
24090_11_ITEM15_P209_S0	Intercompany tax balances are settled quarterly.
24090_11_ITEM15_P210_S0	The Company and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various U.S. states.
24090_11_ITEM15_P210_S1	Most of our subsidiaries are not subject to examination by U.S. tax authorities for years prior to 2007.
24090_11_ITEM15_P210_S2	Some of our subsidiaries have open tax years going back as far as 1995 due to net operating loss carry-forwards.
24090_11_ITEM15_P211_S0	The changes in the components of other comprehensive income (loss) are reported net of the effects of income taxes of 35% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, as indicated below:
24090_11_ITEM15_P212_S0	The Company sponsors a defined contribution profit-sharing plan.
24090_11_ITEM15_P212_S1	Employees with one year of service can participate.

24090_11_ITEM15_P212_S4	The plan does not permit employee contributions.
24090_11_ITEM15_P213_S0	The Company sponsors the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan (the Plan ), which is administered by an independent third party.
24090_11_ITEM15_P213_S1	The Plan is a means for new and existing investors in our Class A Common Stock to purchase and sell shares at market prices.
24090_11_ITEM15_P213_S2	Each share purchased through the Plan is registered in the name of the investing shareholder.
24090_11_ITEM15_P213_S3	The Company offers the Plan to our policyholders for automatic investment of policy benefits, including policyholder dividends.
24090_11_ITEM15_P213_S4	We do not have possession of, or control over, any amounts invested through the Plan.
24090_11_ITEM15_P214_S0	Citizens, Inc. purchased Class A common shares during 2010 that were held by subsidiaries at market value as of the transaction dates, which approximated $4.3 million.
24090_11_ITEM15_P214_S1	These transactions were eliminated for financial reporting purposes in accordance with consolidation accounting, but generated a tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 totaling approximately $1.4 million.
24090_11_ITEM15_P215_S0	In 2010, CICA paid a dividend of $9.3 million to Citizens, Inc. and SPLIC paid a dividend to CICA in the amount of $2.6 million.
24090_11_ITEM15_P215_S1	In 2009, CICA declared a dividend to Citizens, Inc. of $10.5 million that was paid in January 2010 and SPLIC paid a dividend to CICA of $1.4 million.
24090_11_ITEM15_P216_S0	The following table contains selected unaudited financial data for each quarter.
24090_11_ITEM15_P217_S0	Tax expense has been reclassified in the second and third quarters of 2009 from amounts previously reported of $905,000 and $820,000, respectively, for a release of a tax valuation allowance related to ONLIC.
24090_11_ITEM15_P217_S1	The release of the allowance was originally recorded as an adjustment to ONLIC goodwill, but should have been recorded as tax expense.
24090_11_ITEM15_P218_S0	We have evaluated for subsequent events as defined by the accounting guidance through the date of financial statement issuance.
24090_11_ITEM15_P218_S1	No items were identified in this period subsequent to the financial statement date that required adjustment or disclosure.

24090_11_ITEM15_P247_S0	the information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
24090_11_ITEM15_P248_S0	Citizens, Inc. (NYSE: CIA) reported results today for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2010.
24090_11_ITEM15_P249_S0	Rick D. Riley, Vice Chairman and President, said, During 2010, Citizens continued to offer life insurance products emphasizing living benefits in our targeted domestic and international markets.
24090_11_ITEM15_P249_S1	While the business and investing environments remained challenging, the Company experienced growth in revenues and net income, reflecting both an increase in premiums from our insurance operations and an increase in investment income over 2009 as higher invested assets offset declining yields over the course of 2010.
24090_11_ITEM15_P250_S0	Riley noted, In keeping with the long-term horizon of our policyholders, we manage our business with long-range objectives and have responded to conditions of recent years by continuing to foster the relationships that support new insurance sales and high persistency.
24090_11_ITEM15_P251_S0	Though the contribution to net income of full-year realized gains were unchanged, the year-over-year comparison was impacted by another non-operating item a significantly lower gain on the change in the fair value of outstanding warrants, which relates to changes in the market value of our Class A common stock.
24090_11_ITEM15_P252_S0	Total revenues Total revenues increased 3.1% for the quarter ended December 31, and 1.2% for full-year 2010, due to growth in both premiums and investment income.
24090_11_ITEM15_P252_S1	Total revenue, excluding the change in fair value of warrants, increased 3.5% and 2.8% for the same periods.
24090_11_ITEM15_P253_S0	Net income Net income rose by $1.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, and $0.7 million for full-year 2010.
24090_11_ITEM15_P253_S1	On an after-tax basis, realized gains contributed $5.2 million, or $0.11 per share of Class A common stock, to full-year net income, unchanged from 2009.
24090_11_ITEM15_P253_S2	On an after-tax basis, the non-cash charge for the change in fair value of warrants increased net income in 2010 by $0.2 million, which would be less than 1 cent per share of Class A common stock, compared with $3.2 million, or $0.04 per share of Class A common stock, in 2009.
24090_11_ITEM15_P254_S0	Premiums Premium growth for the fourth quarter and full-year was driven by strong persistency and higher endowment sales in the international life insurance business.
24090_11_ITEM15_P254_S1	Life first-year premiums increased 2.8% for 2010 and represented approximately 15% of total life premiums for 2010 and 2009.
24090_11_ITEM15_P255_S0	Endowment sales now represent a significant portion of international new business sales, reflecting increased interest in guaranteed products in recent years from the Pacific Rim and Latin America.
24090_11_ITEM15_P255_S1	Endowment sales rose 10.6% to $9.4 million in 2010.
24090_11_ITEM15_P256_S0	Most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision, which allows the policyholder to tap the cash value of a policy to pay premiums and keep policies in force.
24090_11_ITEM15_P256_S1	The policy loan asset balance increased 10.9% year over year.
24090_11_ITEM15_P257_S0	Underwriting profit Total benefits and expenses rose less rapidly than premiums for the fourth quarter and full-year.
24090_11_ITEM15_P257_S1	For those periods, increases in insurance benefits paid or provided and commissions, which were related to premium growth, particularly the higher endowment sales, were offset by lower expenses and changes in capitalization and amortization of deferred acquisition costs and other items.
24090_11_ITEM15_P258_S0	Investment income is a factor in profitability, but the Company s product design does not depend solely on interest rate spreads, but also relies on the mortality, expense and persistency margins.
24090_11_ITEM15_P259_S0	Investment income Net investment income decreased 21.5% for the quarter ended December 31, 2010, but rose 1.6% for the full-year.
24090_11_ITEM15_P259_S1	Lower yields on invested assets continue to offset higher average investment balances.
24090_11_ITEM15_P260_S0	As noted above, the policy loan asset balance rose by 10.9% in 2010, resulting in an increase in policy loan income, which is included in investment income.
24090_11_ITEM15_P261_S0	Yield and duration During 2010, average invested assets rose 12.6% while average yield declined to 4.32% compared with 4.75% in 2009.

24090_11_ITEM15_P261_S2	Significant calls by issuers of fixed maturity securities has resulted in the Company reinvesting proceeds at lower yields as market rates have declined.
24090_11_ITEM15_P261_S3	During 2010, the Company continued to invest in bonds of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises.
24090_11_ITEM15_P262_S0	Realized gains Realized gains for the full year ended 2010 were comparable to net realized gains from 2009.

24090_11_ITEM15_P262_S3	The Company also sold a number of fixed maturity investments in 2009, resulting in a total gain of over $8.0 million that was offset by realized losses from impairments of $0.3 million.

24090_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	Citizens, Inc. ( Citizens ) is an insurance holding company serving the life insurance needs of individuals in the United States since 1969 and internationally since 1975.
24090_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	Through our insurance subsidiaries, we pursue a strategy of offering traditional insurance products in niche markets where we believe we are able to achieve competitive advantages.
24090_12_ITEM1_P0_S2	We had approximately $1.1 billion of assets at December 31, 2011 and approximately $5.2 billion of insurance in force.
24090_12_ITEM1_P0_S3	Our core insurance operations include issuing and servicing:
24090_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	final expense and limited liability property policies to middle and lower income households in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas through employee and independent agents in our home service distribution channel.
24090_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	We were formed in 1969 by our Chairman, Harold E. Riley.
24090_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	Prior to our formation, Mr. Riley had many years of experience in the international and domestic life insurance business.
24090_12_ITEM1_P2_S2	Our Company has experienced growth through acquisitions in the domestic market and through market expansion in the international market.
24090_12_ITEM1_P2_S3	We seek to capitalize on the experience of our management team in marketing and operations as we strive to generate bottom line return using knowledge of our niche markets and our well-established distribution channels.
24090_12_ITEM1_P2_S4	We believe our underwriting processes, policy terms, pricing practices and proprietary administrative systems enable us to be competitive in our current markets, while protecting our shareholders and serving our policyholders.
24090_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our business has grown, both internationally and domestically, in recent years.
24090_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	Revenues rose from $169.6 million in 2007 to $195.0 million in 2011.
24090_12_ITEM1_P3_S2	During the five years ended December 31, 2011, our assets grew from $787.9 million to $1.1 billion.
24090_12_ITEM1_P3_S3	Total stockholders' equity increased from $176.2 million at December 31, 2007 to $255.7 million at December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	"Selected Financial Data" in this Report.
24090_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	The following pages describe the operations of our three business segments: Life Insurance, Home Service and Other Non-Insurance Enterprises.
24090_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	Revenues derived from any single customer did not exceed 10% of consolidated revenues in any of the last three years.
24090_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our Life Insurance segment issues ordinary whole life insurance domestically and in U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents.
24090_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	These contracts are designed to provide a fixed amount of insurance coverage over the life of the insured.
24090_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	Additionally, endowment contracts are issued by the Company, which are principally accumulation contracts that incorporate an element of life insurance protection.
24090_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	For the majority of our business, we retain only the first $100,000 of risk on any one life.
24090_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	We operate this segment through our subsidiaries: CICA Life Insurance Company of America ("CICA") and Citizens National Life Insurance Company ("CNLIC").
24090_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	We focus our sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies to high net worth, high income residents in Latin America and the Pacific Rim.
24090_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	We have successfully participated in the foreign marketplace since 1975, and we continue to seek opportunities for expansion of our foreign operations.
24090_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	We believe positive attributes of our international insurance business include:
24090_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	favorable persistency levels and mortality rates that are comparable to our U.S. policies.
24090_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	We have implemented several policies and procedures to reduce the risks of asset and premium loss relating to our international business.
24090_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	Approvals for policy issuance are made in our Austin, Texas office and policies are issued and delivered to our independent consultants, who deliver the policies to the insureds.
24090_12_ITEM1_P10_S2	We have no offices, employees or assets outside of the United States.
24090_12_ITEM1_P10_S3	Insurance policy applications and premium payments are submitted by the independent consultants or customers to us and we review the applications in our home offices in Austin, Texas.
24090_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Premiums are paid in U.S. Dollars through a U.S. financial institution by check, wire or credit card.
24090_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	The policies we issue contain limitations on benefits for certain causes of death, such as homicide and careless driving.
24090_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	We have also developed disciplined underwriting criteria, which includes medical reviews of applicants as well as background and reference checks.
24090_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	In addition, we have a claims policy that requires investigation of substantially all death claims.
24090_12_ITEM1_P12_S3	Furthermore, we perform background reviews and reference checks of prospective marketing firms and consultants.
24090_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	Independent marketing firms and consultants specialize in marketing life insurance products and generally have several years of insurance marketing experience.
24090_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	We maintain standard contracts with the independent marketing firms pursuant to which they provide recruitment, training and supervision of their managers and associates in the service and placement of our products; however, all associates of these firms also contract directly with us as independent contractors and receive their compensation directly from us.
24090_12_ITEM1_P13_S2	Accordingly, should an arrangement between any independent marketing firm and us be terminated for any reason, we believe we would continue with the existing marketing arrangements with the associates of these firms without a material loss of sales.
24090_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our standard agreement with independent marketing firms and consultants provides they are independent contractors responsible for their own operation expenses, and that they are the representative of the prospective insured.
24090_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	In addition, the marketing firms guarantee any debts of their associates to us.
24090_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	The marketing firms receive commissions on all new and renewal policies serviced or placed by them or their associates.
24090_12_ITEM1_P14_S3	All of these contracts provide that the independent marketing firms and consultants are aware of and responsible for compliance with local laws.
24090_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	We offer several ordinary whole life insurance and endowment products designed to meet the needs of our non-U.S. policyowners.
24090_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	These policies have been structured to provide:
24090_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	lifetime income guarantees for an insured or for surviving beneficiaries.
24090_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our international products have living benefit features.
24090_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	Every policy contains guaranteed cash values and is participating (i.e., provides for cash dividends as apportioned by the board of directors).
24090_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	Once a policyowner pays the annual premium and the policy is issued, we immediately pay a cash dividend as well as an annual guaranteed endowment, if elected, to the owner.
24090_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	The policyowner has several options with regard to the dividend, including the right to assign dividends to the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan, registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), and administered in the United States by our unaffiliated transfer agent.
24090_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	The life insurance business is highly competitive.
24090_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	We compete with a large number of stock and mutual life companies internationally and domestically, as well as with financial institutions that offer insurance products.
24090_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	There are more than 1,000 life insurance companies in the United States, some of which also provide insurance to foreign residents.
24090_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	Given the variety of foreign markets in which we provide ordinary whole life insurance, it is not possible to ascertain our competitive position.
24090_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	We face competition primarily from companies formed and operated in the country in which the insureds reside, from companies that operate in the same manner as we do and from companies that are foreign to the countries in which policies are sold, but issue insurance policies denominated in the local currency of those countries.
24090_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	A substantial number of companies may be deemed to have a competitive advantage over us due to their significantly greater financial resources, histories of successful operations and larger marketing forces.
24090_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	However, we believe that our experience, combined with the special features of our policies, allow us to compete effectively in pursuing new business.
24090_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	Because premiums on our international policies are paid in U.S. Dollars drawn on U.S. financial institutions, and we pay claims in U.S. Dollars, we provide a product that is different from the products provided by foreign-domiciled companies.
24090_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our international policies are usually acquired by individuals with significant net worth and earnings that place them in the top income brackets of their respective countries.
24090_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	The policies sold by our foreign competitors are generally offered broadly and are priced using the mortality of the entire population of the geographic region.
24090_12_ITEM1_P23_S3	Our mortality charges are therefore typically lower, which provides a competitive advantage.
24090_12_ITEM1_P23_S4	Additionally, the assets backing the reserves for our foreign competitors' policies must be substantially invested in their respective countries and, therefore, are exposed to the inflationary risks and social or economic crises that have been more common in these foreign countries.
24090_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	The majority of our inforce business results from blocks of business of insurance companies we have acquired over the past 15 years.
24090_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	Our acquisition transition strategy focuses on the introduction of our cash accumulation ordinary whole life products to independent marketing consultants associated with companies we have acquired, while continuing to service the needs of acquired policyholders.
24090_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	In the Midwest and the southern United States, we seek to serve middle income households through the sale of cash accumulation ordinary whole life insurance products.
24090_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	Our distribution strategy is through marketing consultants, comprised primarily of part-time, second-career sales associates (such as teachers, coaches, community leaders and others) in rural and urban areas.
24090_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Over the past three years, new product sales have trended downward as we have tightened underwriting on business that did not meet our profitability objectives.
24090_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	Our domestic life insurance products focus primarily on living needs and provide benefits focused toward accumulating money for the policyowner.
24090_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	The features of our domestic life insurance products include:
24090_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	an option to waive premium payments in the event of disability.
24090_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our life insurance products are principally designed to address the insured's concern about outliving his or her monthly income, while at the same time providing death benefits.
24090_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	The primary purpose of our product portfolio is to help the insured create capital for needs such as retirement income, children's higher education funds, business opportunities, emergencies and health care needs.
24090_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	The U.S. life insurance industry is a mature industry that, in recent years, has experienced little to no growth.
24090_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	Competition is intense because the life insurance industry is consolidating, with larger, more efficient and more effective organizations emerging from consolidation.
24090_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	Many domestic life insurance companies have significantly greater financial, marketing forces and other resources, longer business histories and more diversified lines of insurance products than we do.
24090_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	We also face competition from companies marketing in person as well as with direct mail and Internet sales campaigns.
24090_12_ITEM1_P31_S2	Although we may be at a competitive disadvantage to these entities, we believe that our premium rates and policy features are generally competitive with those of other life insurance companies selling similar types of ordinary whole life insurance.
24090_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our Home Service segment operates in this market through our subsidiaries Security Plan Life Insurance Company ("SPLIC") and Security Plan Fire Insurance Company ("SPFIC"), and focus on the life insurance needs of the middle and lower income markets, primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	Our policies are sold and serviced through a home service marketing distribution system of approximately 300 employee-agents who work full time on a route system and through over 230 funeral homes and independent agents to sell policies, collect premiums and service policyholders.
24090_12_ITEM1_P32_S2	To a lesser extent, our Home Service segment sells limited-liability, named peril property policies covering dwelling and contents.
24090_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our home service insurance products consist primarily of small face amount ordinary whole life and pre-need policies, which are designed to fund final expenses for the insured, primarily consisting of funeral and burial costs.
24090_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	The average life insurance policy face amount issued was approximately $7,000 in 2011; therefore, the underwriting performed on these applications is limited.
24090_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	Our property coverages are limited to $30,000 maximum coverage on any one dwelling and contents, while content-only coverage and dwelling-only coverage is limited to $20,000.
24090_12_ITEM1_P33_S3	We face competition in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas from other companies specializing in home service distribution of insurance.
24090_12_ITEM1_P33_S4	We seek to compete based upon our emphasis on personal service to our customers.
24090_12_ITEM1_P33_S5	We intend to continue premium growth within this segment via direct sales and acquisitions.
24090_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	Other Non-insurance Enterprises includes Computing Technology, Inc., which provides data processing services to the Company, and Insurance Investors, Inc., which provides aviation transportation to the Company.
24090_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	This segment also includes the results of Citizens, Inc., the parent Company.
24090_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our administrative operations primarily serve our life insurance segment and are conducted primarily at our executive offices in Austin, Texas through approximately 116 administrative, operating and underwriting personnel.
24090_12_ITEM1_P36_S1	Our Home Service operations are conducted to a large degree from our district offices in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, as well as our support center in Donaldsonville, Louisiana through approximately 64 operations personnel.
24090_12_ITEM1_P36_S2	At our executive offices, we also perform policy design, marketing oversight, underwriting, accounting and reporting, customer service, administration and investing activities.
24090_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our senior management has significant experience in insurance company application system design and implementation.
24090_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	Since the mid-1960's, our senior management has been leading development of evolving insurance applications.
24090_12_ITEM1_P37_S2	We have a single integrated system for our entire Company, which is a centrally-controlled, mainframe-based administrative system.
24090_12_ITEM1_P37_S3	Functions of our administrative system include policy set up, administration, billing and collections, commission calculation, valuation, automated internal audit functions, storage backup, image management and other related functions.
24090_12_ITEM1_P37_S4	Each company we acquire is ultimately converted onto our administrative system.
24090_12_ITEM1_P37_S5	This system has been in place for many years, and we believe it is a significant asset to us.
24090_12_ITEM1_P37_S6	We update our administrative system on an ongoing basis.
24090_12_ITEM1_P37_S7	This system is also capable of significant expansion without substantial capital outlay or increase in staff.
24090_12_ITEM1_P37_S8	Therefore, we believe we can achieve additional growth without costly administrative system expenditures, delays, failures or the addition of substantial staffing.
24090_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our U.S. insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations.
24090_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	State insurance laws establish supervisory agencies with broad regulatory authority to regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of each state in which they are licensed.
24090_12_ITEM1_P38_S2	In addition, U.S. laws, such as the USA Patriot Act of 2001, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the recently enacted Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("the Dodd-Frank Act"), are examples of U.S. regulation that affect our business.
24090_12_ITEM1_P38_S3	We are subject to comprehensive regulations under the USA Patriot Act with respect to money laundering, as well as federal regulations regarding privacy and confidentiality.
24090_12_ITEM1_P38_S4	Our insurance products and thus our businesses also are affected by U.S. federal, state and local tax laws.
24090_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act focuses on financial reform and may result in significant changes to the regulation of institutions operating in the financial services industry, including the Company.
24090_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	Legislative or regulatory requirements imposed by or promulgated in connection with this Act may make it more expensive for the Company to conduct its business, may have a material adverse effect on the overall business climate and could materially affect the profitability of the results of operations and financial condition of financial institutions.
24090_12_ITEM1_P39_S2	The Company is uncertain as to all of the impacts this new legislation will have and cannot provide assurance it will not adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1_P39_S3	In general, government regulation at the federal level may increase and may result in unpredictable consequences for the Company.
24090_12_ITEM1_P39_S4	In addition, other federal laws and regulations apply to us in areas such as pension regulations, privacy, tort reform and taxation.
24090_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	The purpose of the laws and regulations that affect our insurance business is primarily to protect our insureds and not our stockholders.
24090_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations.
24090_12_ITEM1_P40_S2	In addition, insurance regulatory authorities (including state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general) periodically make inquiries and regularly conduct examinations regarding compliance by us and our subsidiaries with insurance, and other laws and regulations regarding the conduct of our insurance businesses.
24090_12_ITEM1_P40_S3	We cooperate with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action when warranted.
24090_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are collectively licensed to transact business in 32 states.
24090_12_ITEM1_P41_S1	We have insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the states of Colorado, Louisiana and Texas.
24090_12_ITEM1_P41_S2	Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are licensed and regulated in all U.S. jurisdictions in which they conduct insurance business.
24090_12_ITEM1_P41_S3	The extent of this regulation varies, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations based upon the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) model rules governing the financial condition of insurers, including standards of solvency, types and concentration of investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, credit for reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy, and the business conduct of insurers, including marketing and sales practices and claims handling.
24090_12_ITEM1_P41_S4	In addition, statutes and regulations usually require the licensing of insurers and their agents, the approval of policy forms and related materials and the approval of rates for certain types of insurance products.
24090_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	All U.S. jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries conduct insurance business have enacted legislation that requires each U.S. insurance company in a holding company system, except captive insurance companies, to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its jurisdiction of domicile and to furnish that regulatory authority financial and other information concerning the operations of, and the interrelationships and transactions among, companies within its holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system.
24090_12_ITEM1_P42_S1	These laws and regulations also regulate transactions between insurance companies and their parents and affiliates.
24090_12_ITEM1_P42_S2	Generally, these laws and regulations require that all transactions within a holding company system between an insurer and its affiliates be fair and reasonable and that the insurer's statutory capital and surplus following any transaction with an affiliate be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.
24090_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	Statutory surplus is the excess of admitted assets over the sum of statutory liabilities and capital.
24090_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	For certain types of agreements and transactions between an insurer and its affiliates, these laws and regulations require prior notification to, and non-disapproval or approval by, the insurance regulatory authority of the insurer's jurisdiction of domicile.
24090_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	The payment of dividends or other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by the insurance laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile.
24090_12_ITEM1_P44_S1	The laws and regulations of some of these jurisdictions also prohibit an insurer from declaring or paying a dividend except out of its earned surplus or require the insurer to obtain regulatory approval before it may do so.
24090_12_ITEM1_P44_S2	In addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employee or other services) if they determine such payment could be adverse to policyholders or insurance contract holders of the subsidiary.
24090_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled require that a controlling party obtain the approval of the insurance commissioner of the insurance company's jurisdiction of domicile prior to acquiring control of the insurer and may delay, deter or prevent a transaction our shareholders might consider desirable.
24090_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	Risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements are imposed on life and property and casualty insurance companies.
24090_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	The NAIC has established minimum capital requirements in the form of RBC.
24090_12_ITEM1_P46_S2	RBC factors the type of business written by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company's business to develop a minimum level of capital called "authorized control level risk-based capital" and compares this level to adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves.
24090_12_ITEM1_P46_S3	Should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk-based capital fall below 200%, a series of actions by the affected company would begin.
24090_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	Government actions in response to the recent financial crisis and market volatility could significantly impact our current regulations.
24090_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	As part of a comprehensive reform of financial services regulation known as the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress established an office within the federal government to collect information about the insurance industry, recommend standards, and represent the United States in dealing with foreign insurance regulators.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investing in our Company involves certain risks.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Set forth below are certain risks with respect to our Company.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Readers should carefully review these risks, together with the other information contained in this report.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties we have described in this report are not the only ones we face.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem not material, may also adversely affect our business.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Any of the risks discussed in this report or that are presently unknown or not material, if they were to actually occur, could result in a significant adverse impact on our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P1_S3	References in the risk factors below to "we," "us," "our," "Citizens" and like terms relate to Citizens, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statement basis, unless specifically identified otherwise.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We operate our subsidiaries as separate and distinct entities with respect to corporate formalities.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	A substantial amount of our revenue comes from foreign residents and is subject to risks associated with foreign insurance laws, political instability and asset transfer restrictions.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	A substantial part of our insurance policy sales are from foreign countries, primarily those in Latin America and the Pacific Rim.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	There is a risk that we may lose a significant portion of these sales should adverse events occur in these countries.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We seek to address this risk by, among other things, not accepting insurance applications outside of the U.S., maintaining all of our assets in the U.S. and requiring that policy premiums be paid to us in U.S. Dollars drawn on U.S. financial institutions.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Accordingly, we have never qualified to do business in any foreign country and have never submitted our insurance policies issued to foreign residents for approval by any foreign or domestic insurance regulatory agency.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We sell our policies to foreign residents using foreign independent marketing firms and independent consultants, and we rely on those persons to comply with applicable laws in marketing our insurance products.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The government of a foreign country could determine that its residents may not buy life insurance from us unless we became qualified to do business in that country or unless our policies purchased by its residents receive prior approval from its insurance regulators.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Also, new laws or regulations could be implemented or new applications of existing laws or regulations could occur, which could result in the cessation of marketing activities by our independent marketing firms and consultants.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	From time to time we have become aware of new foreign laws, regulations or new interpretations of foreign laws or regulations that may have an adverse effect on the marketing efforts of our foreign independent marketing firms and consultants.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We cannot assure you that any of these laws, regulations, or application of them by foreign regulatory authorities will not have an adverse effect on the marketing efforts of our independent marketing firms and consultants and, in turn, on our revenues.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Further, there is no assurance that we would be able to qualify to do business in any foreign country or that its insurance regulatory authorities would approve our policies if we decided to submit our insurance policies for approval.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We could also face sanctions, including fines and penalties, if a country's authorities determined any failure to qualify or otherwise comply with its laws was willful or ongoing.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Any of the foregoing could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Additionally, we do not determine whether our independent consultants are required to be licensed to sell insurance in the countries in which they market our policies.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P6_S6	If our independent consultants were not in compliance with applicable laws, including licensing laws, they could be required to cease operations, which would reduce our revenues.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P6_S7	We have not obtained any advice of counsel in any foreign jurisdictions with respect to these matters.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P6_S8	We are unable to quantify the effect of foreign regulation on our business if regulation were to be imposed on us, but we believe we could expend substantial amounts of time and incur substantial expense in complying with any foreign regulation, and we may decide to withdraw from or avoid a market if foreign regulation were imposed.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Additionally, if economic or political crises were to occur in any of the countries where our foreign policyowners reside, our revenues could be adversely affected.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Also, currency control laws, regulations and decrees in foreign countries, if implemented, could materially adversely affect our revenues by imposing restrictions on asset transfers outside of a country where our insureds reside.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	While our management has more than 40 years of experience in writing life insurance policies for foreign residents without any significant legal prohibition, regulatory action, or any lengthy currency controls relating to our foreign resident insureds, there can be no assurance that such situations will not occur and that our revenues, results of operations and financial condition will not be materially, adversely affected if they do occur.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The majority of our foreign policyholders choose to invest their policy dividends or other cash benefits in our Class A common stock through the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan (the "Plan").
24090_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If a securities regulatory authority were to deem the Plan s operation contrary to applicable securities laws, we risk facing fines and penalties and cease and desist orders which would create a reduction in the amount of Class A common stock purchased on the open market through the Plan.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The offer and sale of our Class A common stock through the Plan is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, but not under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Most all of our foreign policyholders participate in the Plan and choose to invest dividends paid on their insurance policies in our Class A common stock pursuant to the Plan.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We have not obtained any advice of counsel in any foreign jurisdiction as to whether such participation by foreign residents in the Plan is subject to foreign securities laws or regulations or whether our independent consultants in these jurisdictions are subject to licensing requirements in connection with foreign policyholder participation in the Plan.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If a securities regulatory authority were to determine the offer and sale of our Class A common stock under the Plan were contrary to applicable laws and regulations of its jurisdiction, we could be faced with cease and desist orders, fines and penalties, or reduced participation in the Plan by our foreign policyholders.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P10_S4	This also could materially reduce the amount of our Class A common stock purchased and sold in the open market under the Plan, as historically a significant volume of shares have been purchased under the Plan through issuance of policy cash dividends assigned to the Plan.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P10_S5	We could also be faced with private disputes relating to the Plan, including the possibility of securities law claims within the United States.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P10_S6	In the absence of countervailing considerations, we would expect to defend any such claims and we could incur significant defense costs, including not only attorneys' fees and other direct litigation costs, but also the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P10_S7	This could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	As an insurance holding company with significant investment exposure, we face material financial and capital markets risk in our operations.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Due to the low interest rate environment over the past three years, we experienced significant call activity on our fixed income portfolio which has decreased our investment yields compared to prior years.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Also, we recorded other-than-temporary impairments ("OTTI") in the past several years due to credit related market declines.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	In addition, the significant increase in worldwide economic instability and unemployment rates could result in decreased persistency of our insurance policies in force, as well as reduced new insurance policy sales, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Economic uncertainty has recently been exacerbated by the increased potential for default by one or more European sovereign debt issuers, the potential partial or complete dissolution of the Eurozone and its common currency and the negative impact of such events on global financial institutions and capital markets generally.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Actions or inactions of European governments may impact these actual or perceived risks.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	In the U.S. during 2011, one rating agency downgraded the U.S.'s long-term debt credit rating from AAA.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Future actions or inactions of the United States government, including a shutdown of the federal government, could increase the actual or perceived risk that the U.S. may not ultimately pay its obligations when due and may disrupt financial markets.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Changes in market interest rates may significantly affect our profitability.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Some of our products, principally traditional whole life insurance with annuity riders, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our "spread," or the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under our contracts to policyholders and the rate of return we are able to earn on our investments intended to support obligations under the contracts.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our spread is a key component of our net income.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured, prepaid, been sold, or called at lower yields, reducing our investment margin.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our fixed income bond portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk as a significant portion of the portfolio is callable.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Lowering interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in investment margins on some of our products.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	However, our ability to lower these rates could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates, and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our expectation of future spreads is an important component in amortization of deferred acquisition costs and significantly lower spreads may result in increasing amortization, thereby reducing net income for the period.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our investment portfolio is subject to various risks that may result in realized investment losses.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In particular, decreases in the fair value of fixed maturities may significantly reduce the value of our investments, and as a result, our financial condition may suffer.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations under these securities could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in the recognition of investment losses.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the bonds included in our portfolio and by other factors that may result in the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In particular, at December 31, 2011, fixed maturities represented $741.8 million or 88.4% of our total investments of $839.2 million.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The fair value of fixed maturities and the related investment income fluctuates depending on general economic and market conditions.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The fair value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us will generally increase or decrease in line with changes in market interest rates.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	An investment has prepayment risk when there is a risk that the timing of cash flows that result from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We experienced significant prepayments of bonds in our investment portfolio over the past three years.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The impact of value fluctuations affects our consolidated financial statements, as a large portion of our fixed maturities that are classified as available-for- sale, with changes in fair value reflected in our stockholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss).
24090_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	No similar adjustment is made for liabilities to reflect a change in interest rates.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Therefore, interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect our stockholders' equity, total comprehensive income and/or cash flows.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	For mortgage-backed securities, credit risk exists if mortgagees default on the underlying mortgages.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Although at December 31, 2011, approximately 97.7% of our fixed maturities were investment grade with 71.4% rated AA or above, all of our fixed maturities are subject to credit risk.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If any of the issuers of our fixed maturities suffer financial setbacks, the ratings on the fixed maturities could fall (with a concurrent fall in fair value) and, in a worst case scenario, the issuer could default on its financial obligations.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P24_S3	If the issuer defaults, we could have realized losses associated with the impairment of the securities.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	A substantial portion of our investment portfolio is concentrated in U.S. Government sponsored corporations and agencies.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	At December 31, 2011, we had investments with a carrying value of $307.2 million (36.6% of our total invested assets) in U.S. Government sponsored corporations and agencies, including the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie") and the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie").
24090_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Both Freddie and Fannie are currently in conservatorship and the federal government is considering proposals to phase them out, or allow them to continue as private corporations, among other things.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	If they are wound down, it is not clear how investments sponsored by them might be affected; however, the direct and indirect impact on our investment portfolio could be material and could be adverse.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities may be realized or result in future impairments, resulting in a reduction in our net income.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and are, therefore, excluded from our net income.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Our total gross unrealized losses on our available-for-sale securities portfolio at December 31, 2011 were $3.0 million.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	The accumulated change in estimated fair value of these securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is realized upon sale of the security or in the event that the decline in estimated fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary and an impairment charge to earnings is taken.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Realized losses or impairments may have a material adverse effect on our net income in a particular quarterly or annual period.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims and we may be required to establish additional reserves, which in turn may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We maintain reserves to cover our estimated exposure for claims relating to our issued insurance policies.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Reserves, whether calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") or statutory accounting practices prescribed by various state insurance regulators, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections, of what we expect claims will be based on mortality assumptions that are determined by various regulatory authorities.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Many reserve assumptions are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P30_S3	In addition, when we acquire other domestic life insurance companies, our assessment of the adequacy of acquired policy liabilities is subject to our estimates and assumptions.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops, and adjustments to reserves are reflected in our statements of operations for the period in which such estimates are updated.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, future developments may require us to increase claims reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the periods in which such increases occur.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the costs of customer relationships acquired, which would increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	At December 31, 2011, we had $136.3 million of deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	DAC represents costs that vary with and are primarily related to the sale and issuance of our insurance policies and are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P32_S2	These costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions, solicitation and printing costs, sales material costs and some support costs, such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Under U.S. GAAP, DAC is amortized to income over the lives of the underlying policies, in relation to the anticipated recognition of premiums.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In addition, when we acquire a block of insurance policies, we assign a portion of the purchase price to the right to receive future net cash flows from existing insurance and investment contracts and policies.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	This intangible asset, called the cost of customer relationships acquired, or CCRA, represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P34_S2	At December 31, 2011, we had $27.9 million of CCRA.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P34_S3	We amortize the value of this intangible asset in a manner similar to the amortization of DAC.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our amortization of DAC and CCRA generally depends upon anticipated profits from investments, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, persistency and maintenance expense margins.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	For example, if our insurance policy lapse and surrender rates were to exceed the assumptions upon which we priced our insurance policies, or if actual persistency proves to be less than our persistency assumptions, especially in the early years of a policy, we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We regularly review the quality of our DAC and CCRA to determine if they are recoverable from future income.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If these costs are not recoverable, they are charged to expenses in the financial period in which we make this determination.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses, investment returns, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, lapses or persistency may cause us to increase the amortization of DAC or CCRA, or both, or to record a current period expense to increase benefit reserves, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We may be required to recognize an impairment on the value of our goodwill, which would increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the amount paid by us to acquire various life insurance companies over the fair value of their net assets at the date of the acquisition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Under U.S. GAAP, we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the "reporting unit" level, which is either an operating segment or a business that is one level below the operating segment.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Goodwill is impaired if its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P40_S2	This may occur for various reasons, including changes in actual or expected earnings or cash flows of a reporting unit, generation of earnings by a reporting unit at a lower rate than similar businesses or declines in market prices for publicly traded businesses similar to our reporting units.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P40_S3	If any portion of our goodwill becomes impaired, we would be required to recognize the amount of the impairment as a current-period expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Goodwill in our consolidated financial statements was $17.2 million as of December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We are a defendant in lawsuits, which may adversely affect our financial condition and detract from the time our management is able to devote to our business, and we are subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory matters.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We may from time to time be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our business operations, including, but not limited to:
24090_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	disputes relating to businesses acquired and operated by us.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	In the absence of countervailing considerations, we would expect to defend any such claims vigorously.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	However, in doing so, we could incur significant defense costs, including attorneys' fees, other direct litigation costs and the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P44_S2	If we suffer an adverse judgment as a result of any claim, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P44_S3	See Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 8 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Reinsurers with which we do business could increase their premium rates and may not honor their obligations, leaving us liable for the reinsured coverage.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We reinsure certain risks underwritten by our various insurance subsidiaries.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P46_S2	The high cost of reinsurance or lack of affordable coverage could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities and, even if highly desirable or necessary, we may not be able to obtain replacement reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts or at rates economic to us.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P47_S2	If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling or unable to bear an increase in net exposures, we may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P47_S3	In addition, our reinsurance facilities may be cancelled, pursuant to their terms, upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including a change of control of our Company (generally defined as the acquisition of 10% or more of our voting equity securities) or the failure of our insurance company subsidiaries to maintain the minimum required levels of statutory surplus.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Any of these potential developments could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	In 2011, we reinsured $462 million of face amount of our life insurance policies.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Amounts reinsured in 2011 represented 10.1% of the face amount of direct life insurance in force in that year.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Although the cost of reinsurance is, in some cases, reflected in premium rates, under certain reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer may increase the rate it charges us for reinsurance.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	If our cost of reinsurance were to increase, we might not be able to recover these increased costs, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P49_S2	See Note 5 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We may not be able to continue our past strategy of acquiring other U.S. life insurance companies, and we may not realize improvements to our financial results as a result of our past or any future acquisitions.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We have acquired 16 U.S. life insurance companies since 1987.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Our objective in this strategy has been to increase our assets, revenues and capital, improve our competitive position and increase our earnings, in part by realizing certain operating efficiencies associated with economies of scale.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We evaluate possible acquisitions of other insurance companies on an ongoing basis.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P52_S1	While our business model is not dependent primarily upon acquisitions, the time frame for achieving or further improving our market positions can be shortened through acquisitions.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P52_S2	There can be no assurance that suitable acquisitions presenting opportunities for continued growth and operating efficiencies will be available to us, or that we will realize the anticipated financial results from completed acquisitions.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P52_S3	In addition, we face intense competition in seeking to make acquisitions, much of which is from companies with greater financial and human resources than we have.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Even if we identify and complete insurance company acquisitions, we may be unable to integrate them on an economically favorable basis.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Implementation of an acquisition strategy entails a number of risks, including, among others, inaccurate assessment of assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities and the failure to achieve anticipated operating efficiencies, revenues, earnings or cash flow.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our international and domestic operations face significant competition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Our international marketing plan focuses on making available U.S. Dollar-denominated life insurance products to high net worth, high income individuals residing in more than 30 countries.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P56_S1	New competition could increase the supply of available insurance, which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive profitable rates to us, thereby adversely affecting our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Although there are some impediments facing potential competitors that wish to enter the foreign markets we serve, the entry of new competitors into these markets may occur, affording our customers reason to change to other insurance providers.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P56_S3	In connection with our business with foreign nationals, we experience competition primarily from the following sources, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have:
24090_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Foreign operated companies with U.S. Dollar policies.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We face direct competition from companies that operate in the same manner as we operate in our international markets.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Companies foreign to the countries in which their policies are sold but that issue local currency policies.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Another group of our competitors in the international marketplace consists of companies that are foreign to the countries in which their policies are sold but issue life insurance policies denominated in the local currencies of those countries.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Local currency policies provide the benefit of assets located in the country of foreign residents, but entail risks of uncertainty due to local currency fluctuations, as well as the perceived instability and weakness of local currencies.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Locally operated companies with local currency policies.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P61_S1	We compete with companies formed and operated in the country in which our foreign insureds reside.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Generally, these companies are subject to risks of currency fluctuations, and they primarily use mortality tables based on experience of the local population as a whole.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P61_S3	These mortality tables are typically based on significantly shorter life spans than those we use.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P61_S4	As a result, the cost of insurance from these companies tends to be higher than ours.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P61_S5	Although these companies typically market their policies to a broader section of the population than do our independent marketing firms and independent consultants, there can be no assurance that these companies will not endeavor to place a greater emphasis on our target market and compete more directly with us.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	In the United States, we compete with more than 1,000 other life insurance companies of various sizes.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The life insurance business in the United States is highly competitive, in part because it is a mature industry that, in recent years, has experienced little to no growth in life insurance sales.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Many domestic life insurance companies have substantially greater financial resources, longer business histories and more diversified lines of insurance coverage than we do.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P63_S2	These companies also have larger sales forces than we have.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Competition in the United States has also increased recently because the life insurance industry is consolidating, with larger, more efficient organizations emerging from the consolidation.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P64_S0	In addition, from time to time, companies enter and exit the markets in which we operate, thereby increasing competition at times when there are new entrants.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P64_S1	We may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices, or for other reasons.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P65_S0	There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in any of our markets.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P65_S1	If we do not, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Sales of our products may be reduced if we are unable to (i) establish and maintain commercial relationships with independent marketing firms and independent consultants (ii) attract and retain employee agents or (iii) develop and maintain our distribution sources.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We distribute our insurance products through several distribution channels, including independent marketing firms and independent consultants and our employee agents.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P67_S1	These relationships are significant for both our revenues and our profits.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P67_S2	In our life insurance segment, we depend almost exclusively on the services of independent marketing firms and independent consultants.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P67_S3	In our home service insurance segment, we depend on employee agents whose role in our distribution process is integral to developing and maintaining relationships with policyholders.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Significant competition exists among insurers in attracting and maintaining marketers of demonstrated ability.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Some of our competitors may offer better compensation packages for marketing firms, independent consultants and agents and broader arrays of products and have a greater diversity of distribution resources, better brand recognition, more competitive pricing, lower cost structures and greater financial strength or claims paying ratings than we do.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P68_S2	We compete with other insurers for marketing firms, independent consultants and employee agents primarily on the basis of our compensation and support services.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P68_S3	Any reduction in our ability to attract and retain effective sales representatives could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Loss of the services of our senior management team would likely hinder development of our operating and marketing programs and our strategy for expanding our business.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We rely on the active participation of our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Harold E. Riley (age 83), and our Vice Chairman of the Board and President, Rick D. Riley (age 58), in connection with the development and execution of our operating and marketing plans and strategy for expanding our business.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P70_S1	We anticipate that their expertise will continue to be of substantial value in connection with our operations.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P70_S2	The loss of the services of either of these individuals could have a significant adverse effect on our business and prospects.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P70_S3	We do not have an employment agreement with either of these persons nor do we carry a key-man insurance policy on either of their lives.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the United States, which increases our costs of doing business and could restrict the conduct of our business.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in U.S. jurisdictions wherein we do business, as well as anti-money laundering regulations adopted under the USA Patriot Act.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Insurance company regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, with substantially lesser protections to shareholders of the regulated insurance companies.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P73_S1	To that end, all the states in which we do business have insurance regulatory agencies with broad powers under law with respect to such things as: licensing companies to transact business; mandating capital and surplus requirements; regulating trade and claims practices; approving policy forms; and restricting companies' ability to enter and exit markets.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The capacity for an insurance company's growth in premiums is partially a function of its required statutory surplus.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus, as measured by statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by a company's state of domicile, is considered important by all state insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Failure to maintain required levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action by regulatory authorities.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Most insurance regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant, renew, suspend and revoke licenses and approvals, and could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities, including acquisitions of other insurance companies, require us to add capital to our insurance company subsidiaries, or fine us.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P75_S1	If we are unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, or if our insurance business is determined not to comply fully with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations and their interpretations, including the USA Patriot Act, our revenues, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Although the U.S. federal government has not historically regulated the insurance business, the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, expands the federal presence in insurance oversight.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P76_S1	The Act's requirements include streamlining the state-based regulation of reinsurance and non-admitted insurance (also known as surplus lines insurance, which is property or casualty insurance written by a company that is not licensed to sell policies of insurance in a given state).
24090_12_ITEM1A_P76_S2	This legislation also establishes a new Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury with powers over all lines of insurance except health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P76_S3	The Federal Insurance Office is authorized to, among other things, gather data and information to monitor aspects of the insurance industry, identify issues in the regulation of insurers about insurance matters and preempt state insurance measures under certain circumstances.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P77_S0	As this Act calls for numerous studies and contemplates further regulation, the future impact of the Act on our results of operations or our financial condition cannot be determined at this time.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Changes in U.S. regulation may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and limit our prospective growth.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Currently, the U.S. Federal Government does not directly regulate the insurance business, although initiatives for Federal regulation of insurance are proposed by members of the U.S. Congress from time to time.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P79_S1	However, Federal legislation and administrative policies in several other areas can materially and adversely affect insurance companies, including our business.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P79_S2	These areas include the USA Patriot Act, financial services regulation, securities regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P79_S3	In addition, various forms of direct federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Our failure to maintain effective information systems could adversely affect our business.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We must maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop new information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P81_S1	If we do not maintain adequate systems, we could experience adverse consequences, including products acquired through acquisition, inadequate information on which to base pricing, underwriting and reserve decisions, regulatory problems, failure to meet prompt payment obligations, increases in administrative expenses and loss of customers.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Some of our information technology systems and software are mainframe-based, legacy-type systems that require an ongoing commitment of resources to maintain current standards.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Our systems utilize proprietary code requiring highly skilled personnel.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Due to the unique nature of our proprietary operating environment, we could have difficulty finding personnel with the skills required to provide ongoing system maintenance and development as we seek to keep pace with changes in our products and business models, information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and policyholder needs.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P82_S3	Our success is dependent upon, among other things, maintaining and enhancing the effectiveness of existing systems, as well as continuing to integrate, develop and enhance our information systems to support business processes in a cost-effective manner.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Our failure to protect confidential information and privacy could result in the loss of customers, subject us to fines and penalties and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to privacy regulations.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P85_S1	The actions we take to protect confidential information include among other things: monitoring our record retention plans and policies and any changes in state or federal privacy and compliance requirements; maintaining secure storage facilities for tangible records; and limiting access to electronic information in order to safeguard certain information.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P86_S0	In addition, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires that we deliver a notice regarding our privacy policy both at the delivery of an insurance policy and annually thereafter.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Certain exceptions are allowed for sharing of information under joint marketing agreements.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P87_S1	However, certain state laws may require us to obtain a policyholder's consent before we share information.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We have a written information security program with appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect such confidential information.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P88_S1	If we do not comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information, we could experience adverse consequences, including regulatory sanctions, loss of reputation and litigation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P89_S0	The insurance industry in which we operate may be subject to periodic negative publicity, which may negatively impact our financial results.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P90_S0	We interface with and distribute our products to individual consumers.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P90_S1	There may be a perception that these purchasers may be unsophisticated and in need of consumer protection.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P90_S2	Accordingly, from time to time, consumer advocate groups or the media may focus attention on our products, thereby subjecting the insurance industry to periodic negative publicity.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P90_S3	We may also be negatively impacted if other insurance companies engage in practices resulting in increased public attention to our businesses.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P90_S4	Negative publicity may result in lower sales of insurance, lower persistency of our insurance products, increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation, which may further increase our costs of doing business and impede our ability to market our products.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P90_S5	As a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P91_S0	General economic, financial market and political conditions may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected from time to time by general economic, financial market and political conditions, both in the United States and in the foreign countries where our policyowners reside.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P92_S1	These conditions include economic cycles such as: levels of consumer spending; levels of inflation; movements of the financial markets; availability of credit; fluctuations in interest rates, monetary policy or demographics; and legislative and competitive changes.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P93_S0	During periods of economic downturn, such as the ones recently experienced, our insureds may choose not to purchase our insurance products, may terminate existing policies, permit policies to lapse or may choose to reduce the amount of coverage purchased, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Also, our sales of new insurance policies might decrease.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by applicable laws and regulations in the amounts of fees, dividends and other distributions they may make to us.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P94_S1	The inability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us in sufficient amounts for us to conduct our operations could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations or expand our business.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P95_S0	As a holding company, our principal asset is the stock of our subsidiaries.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P95_S1	We rely primarily on statutorily permissible payments from our insurance company subsidiaries, principally through service agreements we have with our subsidiaries, to meet our working capital and other corporate expenses.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P95_S2	The ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to make payments to us is subject to regulation by the states in which they are domiciled, and these payments depend primarily on approved service agreements between us and these subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, the statutory surplus (which is the excess of assets over liabilities as determined under statutory accounting practices prescribed by an insurance company's state of domicile), future statutory earnings (which are earnings as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices) and regulatory restrictions.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Generally, the net assets of our insurance company subsidiaries available for dividends are limited to either the lesser or greater (depending on the state of domicile) of the subsidiary's net gain from operations during the preceding year and 10% of the subsidiary's net statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Except to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of our subsidiaries' creditors, including policyholders, have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors and shareholders.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P97_S1	If any of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates or otherwise reorganizes, our creditors and shareholders will have no right to proceed in their own right against the assets of that subsidiary or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of the subsidiary under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to debt and equity capital and our cost of capital in seeking to expand our business.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P99_S0	The capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility over the past several years.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P99_S1	In some cases, the markets exerted significant downward pressure on availability of debt and equity capital for certain issuers (including short term liquidity and credit capacity).
24090_12_ITEM1A_P99_S2	We believe the availability of debt and equity capital has decreased significantly compared to prior years.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P100_S0	The availability of equity and debt financing to us will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit capacity, as well as the possibility that investors or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P100_S1	Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets may also limit our access to equity capital for us to seek to expand our business.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P100_S2	As such, we may be forced to delay raising debt or equity capital, or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could adversely affect our ability to seek any acquisitions and negatively impact profitability of an acquisition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Unexpected losses in future reporting periods may require us to adjust the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P102_S0	We evaluate our deferred tax asset ( DTA ) quarterly for recoverability based on available evidence.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P102_S1	This process involves management's judgment about assumptions, which are subject to change from period to period due to tax rate changes or variances between our projected operating performance and our actual results.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P102_S2	Ultimately, future adjustments to the DTA valuation allowance, if any, will be determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P103_S0	The realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry back or carry forward periods under applicable tax law.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we may be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P104_S1	Such an adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and capital position.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P105_S0	The price of our Class A common stock may be impacted by the level of participation in the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan (the "Plan").
24090_12_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Most all of our international policyholders participate in the Plan and they invest their policy dividends and benefits in our Class A common stock pursuant to the Plan.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P106_S1	Once a policyholder elects to participate in the Plan, his or her policy benefits are assigned to purchase Citizens Class A common stock under the Plan in the open market.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P106_S2	There is a risk our Class A common stock price could be negatively impacted by a decrease in our policyholders' participation in the Plan.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P106_S3	If fewer policyholders elect to participate in the Plan, or our international premium collections were to decrease as a result of regulatory, economic, or marketing impediments, the trading volume of our Class A stock may decline from its present levels and the demand for our Class A common stock could be negatively impacted.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Control of our Company, through the ownership of our Class B Common Stock, may be held by a 501(c)(3) charitable foundation established by our Founder and we cannot determine whether any change in our management, operations, or operating strategies will occur as a result of such an ownership change.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Harold E. Riley, our Founder, Chairman and CEO, is the beneficial owner of 100% of the Citizens Class B common stock, which is held in the name of the Harold E. Riley Trust ("Trust"), of which he serves as Trustee.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P108_S1	Citizens' Class A and Class B common stock are identical in all respects, except the Class B common stock elects a simple majority of the Board and receives one-half of any cash dividends paid, on a per share basis, to the Class A shares.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P108_S2	Therefore, Mr. Riley controls our Company.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P108_S3	The Class A common stock elects the remainder of the Board.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P108_S4	The Trust documents provide that upon Mr. Riley's death, the Class B common stock will be transferred from the Trust to the Harold E. Riley Foundation, a charitable organization established under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Foundation").
24090_12_ITEM1A_P108_S5	In addition, the Trust documents provide that Mr. Riley may at any time transfer the Class B common stock held by the Trust to the Foundation.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P108_S6	It is unclear what, if any, changes would occur to our board, management structure, or corporate operating strategies as a result of different ownership of our Class B common stock.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P109_S0	There are a substantial number of our issued shares of Class A common stock eligible for future sale in the public market.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P109_S1	The sale of these shares could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fall.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P110_S0	There were 48,808,662 shares of our Class A common stock issued as of December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P110_S1	Our executive officers, directors and management owned approximately 4,084,000 shares of our Class A common stock as of December 31, 2011, representing approximately 8% of our then outstanding Class A common stock.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P110_S2	Almost all of these shares have been registered for public resale and generally may be sold freely.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P110_S3	In the event of a sale of some or all of these shares or the perceived sale of these shares, the market price of our Class A common stock could fall substantially.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P111_S0	The price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Our Class A common stock price has historically fluctuated and is likely to fluctuate in the future and could decline materially because of the volatility of the stock market in general, decreased participation in the Plan referred to above or a variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: quarterly or annual variations in actual or anticipated results of our operations; interest rate fluctuations; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; competition and other factors affecting the life insurance business generally; and conditions in the U.S. and world economies.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Our Class A common shareholders do not control us and have a limited ability to influence our business policies and corporate actions and are not by themselves able to elect any of our directors.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P114_S0	It is difficult for Class A common shareholders to elect any of our directors or otherwise exert any significant influence over our business.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P114_S1	The sole holder of our outstanding Class B common stock is entitled to elect a simple majority of our board of directors and therefore controls us.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P114_S2	All of our Class B common stock is currently owned by the Harold E. Riley Trust, of which Harold E. Riley, our founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, is the sole trustee.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P114_S3	Additionally, Harold E. Riley beneficially owns approximately 5% of the issued shares of our Class A common stock.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P115_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as applicable state insurance laws, may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P116_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as various state insurance laws, may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a takeover attempt our shareholders might consider in their best interests.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P116_S1	As a result, our shareholders will be prevented from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our Class A common stock that may be offered by a bidder in a takeover context.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P116_S2	Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P117_S0	The following provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws make it difficult for our Class A shareholders to replace or remove our directors and have other anti-takeover effects that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt:
24090_12_ITEM1A_P118_S0	our board of directors may issue one or more series of preferred stock without the approval of our shareholders.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P119_S0	State insurance laws generally require prior approval of a change in control of an insurance company.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P119_S1	Generally, such laws provide that control over an insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the insurer.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P120_S0	In considering an application to acquire control of an insurer, an insurance commissioner generally will consider such factors as the experience, competence and financial strength of the proposed acquirer, the integrity of the proposed acquirer s board of directors and executive officers, the proposed acquirer's plans for the management and operation of the insurer, and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the acquisition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P120_S1	In addition, a person seeking to acquire control of an insurance company is required in some states to make filings prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and the target insurance company and their affiliates have sufficiently large market shares in particular lines of insurance in those states.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P120_S2	These state insurance requirements may delay, deter or prevent our ability to complete an acquisition.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P121_S0	We have never paid any cash dividends on our Class A common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P122_S0	We have never paid cash dividends on our Class A common stock, as it is our policy to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business.
24090_12_ITEM1A_P122_S1	We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
24090_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	We own our principal office in Austin, Texas, consisting of an 80,000 square foot office building in addition to approximately one acre of land nearby that houses storage facilities.
24090_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	Approximately 50,000 square feet is occupied or reserved for our operations.
24090_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also own a training facility at Lake Buchanan, Texas.
24090_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	In addition, we own other properties in Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana that are incidental to our operations.
24090_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are a defendant in a lawsuit filed on August 6, 1999, in the Texas District Court, Austin, Texas, now styled Delia Bolanos Andrade, et al., Plaintiffs, v. Citizens Insurance Company of America, et al., Defendants in which a class was originally certified by the trial court and reversed by the Texas Supreme Court in 2007 with an order to the trial court to conduct further proceedings consistent with its ruling.
24090_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	The underlying lawsuit alleged that certain life insurance policies CICA made available to non-U.S. residents, when combined with a policy feature that allowed certain cash benefits to be assigned to two non-U.S. trusts for the purpose of accumulating ownership of our Class A common stock, along with allowing the policyholders to make additional contributions to the trusts, were actually offers and sales of securities that occurred in Texas by unregistered dealers in violation of the Texas securities laws.
24090_12_ITEM3_P0_S2	The remedy sought was rescission and return of the insurance premium payments.
24090_12_ITEM3_P0_S3	On December 9, 2009, the trial court denied the recertification of the class after conducting additional proceedings in accordance with the Texas Supreme Court's ruling.
24090_12_ITEM3_P0_S4	The remaining plaintiffs must now proceed individually, and not as a class, if they intend to pursue their claims against us.
24090_12_ITEM3_P0_S5	Since the December 9, 2009 trial court ruling, no individual cases have been further pursued by the plaintiffs.
24090_12_ITEM3_P0_S6	The probability of the plaintiffs further pursuing their cases individually is unknown.
24090_12_ITEM3_P0_S7	An estimate of any possible loss or range of losses cannot be made at this time in regard to individuals pursuing claims.
24090_12_ITEM3_P0_S8	However, should the plaintiffs further pursue their claims individually, we intend to vigorously defend any proceedings.
24090_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	SPFIC is a defendant in a putative class action lawsuit in Louisiana styled The State of Louisiana v. AAA Insurance (the "Road Home Litigation"), which was filed in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans on August 23, 2007.
24090_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	The Louisiana Attorney General filed the Road Home Litigation as a putative class action lawsuit in state court against SPFIC and approximately 200 other insurers on behalf of the State of Louisiana, as assignee, and on behalf of a class of Road Home fund recipients alleging that SPFIC and the other insurers have failed to pay all damages owed under their policies.
24090_12_ITEM3_P1_S2	The insurers removed the matter to federal court.
24090_12_ITEM3_P1_S3	The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, and in March 2009, the district court granted part of the defendants motion, dismissing all of the extra-contractual claims, including the bad faith and breach of fiduciary duty claims.
24090_12_ITEM3_P1_S4	As a result, the remaining claims are for breach of contract and declaratory relief on the alleged underpayment of claims by the insurers.
24090_12_ITEM3_P1_S5	The court did not dismiss the class action allegations.
24090_12_ITEM3_P1_S6	The defendants also had moved to dismiss the complaint on grounds that the State had no standing to bring the lawsuit as an assignee of insureds because of anti-assignment language in the insurers policies.
24090_12_ITEM3_P1_S7	The court denied the defendants motion for reconsideration on the assignment issue but found the matter was ripe for consideration by the federal appellate court.
24090_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	The defendants filed a petition for permission to appeal to the Fifth Circuit.
24090_12_ITEM3_P2_S1	On July 20, 2011, the Fifth Circuit ruled there was no public policy which precludes an anti-assignment clause from applying to post loss assignments, but the anti-assignment language must be evaluated on a policy by policy basis and unambiguously express that the non-assignment clause applies to post-loss assignments.
24090_12_ITEM3_P2_S2	In October 2011, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana denied the State s motion to remand to state court.
24090_12_ITEM3_P2_S3	The Road Home Litigation remains pending in federal district court.
24090_12_ITEM3_P2_S4	The State has yet to identify the specific claims it contends are at issue in the Road Home Litigation, or the alleged deficiencies in adjusting those claims.
24090_12_ITEM3_P2_S5	Each individual claim at issue will require an individual analysis.
24090_12_ITEM3_P2_S6	A number of the claims may be subject to individual defenses.
24090_12_ITEM3_P2_S7	To date, there has been no discovery in the Road Home Litigation.
24090_12_ITEM3_P2_S8	We anticipate the State will vigorously pursue the matter in the district court and are uncertain as to the impact a case by case analysis of claims will have on SPFIC.
24090_12_ITEM3_P2_S9	An estimate of possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time as a result of the Fifth Circuit or federal district court's rulings in the Road Home Litigation.
24090_12_ITEM3_P2_S10	SPFIC intends to vigorously defend any remaining proceedings.
24090_12_ITEM3_P3_S0	SPFIC is vigorously defending a number of matters in various stages of development filed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in addition to the Road Home Litigation, including a number of individual lawsuits, which are immaterial to the Company s financial statements.
24090_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol CIA.
24090_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	Quarterly high and low closing prices per share of our Class A common stock as reported by the NYSE are shown below.
24090_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	The number of stockholders on record on March 5, 2012 was as follows:
24090_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	We have never paid cash dividends on our Class A or B common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
24090_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	We did not purchase any of our equity securities during any quarter in 2009, 2010 or 2011.
24090_12_ITEM5_P5_S0	We do not maintain any equity compensation plans or arrangements.
24090_12_ITEM5_P5_S1	Thus, we do not have any securities authorized for issuance under these types of plans, nor have we issued any options, warrants or similar instruments to purchase any of our equity securities, except for warrants issued in conjunction with the convertible preferred stock issued in 2004 and 2005.

24090_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following is management's discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations of the Company.
24090_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	It is intended to be a discussion of certain key financial information regarding the Company and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes to this report on Form 10-K.
24090_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	We conduct operations as an insurance holding company emphasizing ordinary life insurance products in niche markets where we believe we can achieve competitive advantages.
24090_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	As an insurance provider, we collect premiums on an ongoing basis to pay future benefits to our policy and contract holders.
24090_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company derives its revenues principally from 1) premiums earned for insurance coverages provided to insureds; 2) net investment income; and 3) net realized capital gains and losses.
24090_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Profitability of our insurance operations depends heavily upon the Company s underwriting discipline, as we seek to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, management of claims, use of reinsurance, the size of our in force block, actual mortality and morbidity experience, and our ability to manage our expense ratio, which we accomplish through economies of scale and management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses.
24090_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future losses based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the Company s response to competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels.
24090_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Company seeks to price our insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin.
24090_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	For many of our insurance products, the Company is required to obtain approval for the premium rates from state insurance departments.
24090_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	The profitability of fixed annuities, riders and other spread-based product features depends largely on the Company s ability to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on assets and interest credited to policyholders.
24090_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	The investment return, or yield, on invested assets is an important element of the Company s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before benefits are paid.
24090_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	The majority of the Company s invested assets have been held in available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, primarily in asset classes of corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and government obligation bonds.
24090_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	The primary investment objective for the Company is to maximize economic value, consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including the management of credit risk and interest rate sensitivity of invested assets, while generating sufficient after-tax income to meet policyholder and corporate obligations.
24090_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	The Company maintains a conservative investment strategy that may vary based on a variety of factors including business needs, regulatory requirements and tax considerations.
24090_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our assets grew from $986.5 million as of December 31, 2010, to $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	Total stockholders' equity increased from $227.6 million at December 31, 2010, to $255.7 million at December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Net investment income increased 2.9% for 2011 and was flat in 2010 and 2009.
24090_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	The average yield on the consolidated investment portfolio has declined significantly the last three years from a yield of 4.75% in 2009 down to 4.32% in 2010 and to 4.03% in 2011.
24090_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	The increase in the investment asset balances due to premium revenue growth was sufficient to offset the lower yield in the declining rate environment and resulted in an increase in net investment income.
24090_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Realized net investment gains in the past three years resulted primarily from sales of securities that had been previously impaired due to declines in market values.
24090_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	These gains were partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments that were recorded in 2011, 2010 and 2009 of $631,000, $27,000 and $296,000, respectively, reported as realized losses.
24090_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Claims and surrenders expense decreased 1.6% from the comparable period in 2010 as a result of favorable development.
24090_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	For over thirty years, CICA and its predecessors have accepted policy applications from foreign nationals for U.S. Dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies.
24090_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	We make our insurance products available using third-party marketing organizations and independent marketing consultants.
24090_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Endowment product sales have been on the rise and represented approximately 80% of new sales.
24090_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	The Company offers a ten, fifteen and twenty year endowment and our top selling endowment is a product that matures at age sixty-five.
24090_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	We also introduced a new product in the current year that is an endowment at age eighteen with a payout over four or five years.
24090_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	We have had limited sales to date, but we anticipate this product will be well received in our international markets.
24090_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Through the domestic market of our Life Insurance segment, we provide ordinary whole life, credit life insurance, and final expense policies to middle and lower income families and individuals in certain markets in the mid-west and southern U.S.
24090_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	The majority of our domestic revenues are the result of acquisitions of domestic life insurance companies since 1987.
24090_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	We provide final expense ordinary life insurance to middle and lower income individuals in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	Our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through a home service marketing distribution system utilizing employee-agents who work on a route system to collect premiums and service policyholders, and through networks of funeral homes that collect premiums and provide personal policyholder service.
24090_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	Significant economic issues impacting our business and industry currently and into the future are discussed below.
24090_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	It is predicted that the interest rate environment will remain low for the foreseeable future, which translates into lower profit margins for insurers.
24090_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	We have been impacted by the historically low interest rate environment over the past several years as our fixed income investment portfolio, primarily invested in callable securities, has been reinvested at lower yields during this declining interest rate environment.
24090_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	The Company s conservative investment strategy has not changed, but it has been a challenging investment time, as large amounts of calls resulted in significant cash balances to be reinvested.
24090_12_ITEM7_P19_S3	The Company experienced some delays in reinvesting the funds as suitable bonds meeting our target characteristics of investment grade and yield parameters were identified.
24090_12_ITEM7_P19_S4	Our investment earnings also impact the reserve and Deferred Acquisition Costs ( DAC ) balances, as assumptions are used in the development of the balances.
24090_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Due to the recent decline in investment yields on our portfolio, our projection of long-term investment returns has declined.
24090_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	This has resulted in increasing the reserves on policies issued in the current year, as well as reducing the DAC asset.
24090_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	As an increasing percentage of the world population reaches retirement age, we believe we will benefit from increased demand for living products rather than death products, as aging baby boomers will require cash accumulation to pay expenses to meet their lifetime needs.
24090_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	Our ordinary life products are designed to accumulate cash values to provide for living expenses in a policy owner's later years, while continuously providing a death benefit.
24090_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	We believe there is a trend toward consolidation of domestic life insurance companies, due to significant losses incurred by the life insurance industry as a result of the credit crisis and recent economic pressures, as well as increasing costs of regulatory compliance for domestic life insurance companies.
24090_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	We believe this trend should be a benefit to our acquisition strategy as more complementary acquisition candidates may become available for us to consider.
24090_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Many of the events and trends affecting the life insurance industry have had an impact on the life reinsurance industry.
24090_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	These events have led to a decline in the availability of reinsurance.
24090_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	While we currently cede a limited amount of our primary insurance business to reinsurers, we may find it difficult to obtain reinsurance in the future, forcing us to seek reinsurers who are more expensive to us.
24090_12_ITEM7_P23_S3	If we cannot obtain affordable reinsurance coverage, either our net exposures will increase or we will have to reduce our underwriting commitments.
24090_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	While our management has more than 40 years of experience in writing life insurance policies for foreign residents, changes related to foreign government laws and regulations and application of them, along with currency controls affecting our foreign resident insureds could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	In 2008, the Company acquired Ozark National Life Insurance Company ( ONLIC ), an Arkansas domiciled life company.
24090_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	This entity provided an Arkansas field force of home service agents and funeral homes selling pre-need and final expense policies and was merged into SPLIC as of October 1, 2009, and is included in the Home Service segment.
24090_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	In the first quarter of 2009, the Company completed its acquisition of Integrity Capital Corporation ("ICC").
24090_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	ICC is the parent of Integrity Capital Insurance Company ("ICIC"), an Indiana life insurance company.
24090_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	Both ICC and ICIC were merged into CICA effective April 1, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	On August 1, 2011, SPLIC entered into assumption reinsurance agreements with Escude Life Insurance Company in Rehabilitation, and Benton Life Insurance Company in Rehabilitation.
24090_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	At the time the agreements were executed, both companies were under receivership with the Louisiana Department of Insurance.
24090_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	In total, SPLIC assumed approximately $4.5 million in reserve liabilities and received approximately $4.6 million in cash, with a minimal reinsurance ceding commission being paid.
24090_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	These transactions are accounted for under business combination accounting and are not deemed material.
24090_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	A discussion of consolidated results is presented below, followed by a discussion of Segment Operations and financial results by segment.
24090_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Insurance revenues are primarily generated from premium revenues and investment income.
24090_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	In addition, realized gains and losses on investment holdings can significantly impact revenues from year to year.
24090_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	Premium income derived from life, accident and health, and property insurance sales, increased 6.1% during 2011.
24090_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	The increase resulted primarily from renewal premiums, which totaled $135.1 million, $127.1 million and $123.2 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	Endowment sales represent a significant portion of new business sales internationally, as these products have gained in popularity over the past several years.
24090_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	In addition, most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision, which allows the policyholder to use cash value of a policy to pay premiums.
24090_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	The policy loan asset balance increased 9.8% year over year.
24090_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Net investment income increased to $31.0 million in 2011 compared to $30.1 million in 2010, despite a decline in the yield on investments as we experienced higher average invested assets as a result of investment of new premium revenue.
24090_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	Net investment income performance is summarized as follows.
24090_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Yields on invested assets vary between segment operations due to different portfolio mixes in the segments.
24090_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	The life segment invests more in U.S. government securities while the home service segment has a larger concentration in the corporate and municipal sectors.
24090_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	We have traditionally invested in fixed maturity securities with a large percent held in callable issues.
24090_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	Over the past three years, we have experienced significant call activity related to fixed maturity security holdings due to the historically low interest rate environment.
24090_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	As these call proceeds were invested into lower yielding securities, the yield on the portfolio has declined.
24090_12_ITEM7_P35_S3	The recent declines in yield rates appear to be leveling off as the reinvestment of calls is resulting in a lesser impact relative to yield changes.
24090_12_ITEM7_P35_S4	If market interest rates begin to rise, our call risk would diminish and our portfolio yield will rise over time, as new money investments would be made at higher rates.
24090_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	Investment income from fixed maturity securities accounted for approximately 84.2% of total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	We continue to hold investments in bonds of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, such as Federal National Mortgage Association ( FNMA ) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( FHLMC ), which comprised 42.7% of the total fixed maturity portfolio based on amortized cost at December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	We have increased our investment purchases of corporate and municipal securities over the past year, focusing on utility service sectors in these security categories.
24090_12_ITEM7_P36_S3	In addition, we have reinvested proceeds from bond calls totaling $31.5 million into equity securities related to bond mutual funds during the year.
24090_12_ITEM7_P36_S4	These securities offer a competitive yield with a shorter duration.
24090_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Lower investment income from fixed maturity investments for the year resulted from declining yields, as previously noted.
24090_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	The increase in earnings on asset balances of fixed maturity and equity securities from new money investments is offsetting the yield decline for the year.
24090_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	In addition, the increase in the policy loans asset balance, which represents policyholders utilizing their accumulated policy cash value, contributed to the increase to investment income.
24090_12_ITEM7_P37_S3	Other investment income for the year ended December 31, 2009 included a legal settlement of $0.2 million in connection with a defaulted bond investment.
24090_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments .
24090_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company sold equity mutual funds, which were previously impaired, and realized gains of $1.3 million, $6.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Realized investment gains (losses) are as follows.
24090_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Included in net realized investment gains and losses are OTTI on investments.
24090_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	We recorded an OTTI write-down in 2011 of $70,000 related to one American Airlines ( AMR ) debt security holding that had a maturity date in 2012.
24090_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	AMR declared bankruptcy in November of 2011.
24090_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	We also recorded an impairment in 2011 of $0.6 million related to an investment property that was acquired as part of the ONLIC acquisition in 2008.
24090_12_ITEM7_P41_S3	A current appraisal reflected a declining value of this Arkansas office building from the fair value at acquisition.
24090_12_ITEM7_P41_S4	In 2010, one security that had been previously impaired was written down with a charge to income of $27,000.
24090_12_ITEM7_P41_S5	In 2009, the Company recorded $0.3 million in realized losses related to impairments due to market declines related to issuer credit deterioration.
24090_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	Decrease in Fair Value of Warrants .
24090_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	The market value of our Class A common stock increased in 2011 and decreased during 2010 and 2009.
24090_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	We recognized a gain on the decrease in fair value of warrants of $1.1 million, $0.2 million and $3.2 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	The gains in 2010 and 2009 were directly related to the decrease in the price of our Class A common stock; however, the 2011 gain was the result of the significant decrease in the number of warrants outstanding due to expirations and exercises.
24090_12_ITEM7_P42_S4	The total number of warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2011 was 169,482 and was 1,201,440 in 2010 and 2009.
24090_12_ITEM7_P42_S5	The warrant liability is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which projects the future value of the warrants when they expire.
24090_12_ITEM7_P42_S6	Current accounting standards require the change in the value of the warrant liability be recorded as a component of revenues.
24090_12_ITEM7_P42_S7	When the liability increases we incur a loss, and when the liability decreases we recognize income.
24090_12_ITEM7_P42_S8	The warrant liability is not anticipated to have an effect on the Company's cash flows, as the Company expects the warrants will either be exercised and converted into our Class A common stock in 2012, at the election of the warrant holders, or expire.
24090_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	As noted in the table below, claims and surrenders decreased from $61.0 million in 2010 to $60.1 million in 2011.
24090_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	The Company monitors death claims based upon expectations.
24090_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	The claims experience was favorable in 2011, decreasing by 7.4% from 2010 recorded amounts and remained relatively consistent over the prior two years.
24090_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	Additionally, 2011 results include a $0.8 million incurred but not reported release of liability related to our claim expense calculation.
24090_12_ITEM7_P44_S3	These values may routinely fluctuate from year to year.
24090_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Policy surrenders increased in 2011 and 2010 compared to 2009, but remained at a level that represents approximately 0.5% of direct ordinary whole life insurance inforce.
24090_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	The increase in surrender expense is primarily related to our international business and is expected to increase over time due to the aging of this block of business.
24090_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	A significant portion of surrenders relates to policies that have been in force over fifteen years and no longer have a surrender charge associated with them.
24090_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	Total direct insurance inforce reported in 2011 was $4.6 billion, and in 2010 was $4.5 billion compared to $4.4 billion in 2009.
24090_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	Endowment benefits increased in each of the last three years.
24090_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	We have a series of international policies that carry an immediate endowment benefit of an amount selected by the policy owner.
24090_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	These benefits have been popular in the Pacific Rim and Latin America, where the Company has experienced increased interest in our guaranteed products in recent years.
24090_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	Like policy dividends, endowments are factored into the premium and, as such, the increase has no impact on profitability.
24090_12_ITEM7_P49_S3	The Company expects these benefits to continue to increase as this block of business increases and persists.
24090_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	Property claims increased 26% to approximately $2.0 million in 2011 compared with the amount reported for 2010 and 2009, as the prior two years reflected claims reported that were lower than historical experience.
24090_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	The change in future policy benefit reserves has increased over the past several years, primarily because of the sale of endowment products, which build reserves at a much higher rate.
24090_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	Endowment sales totaled approximately $12.3 million, $9.4 million and $8.5 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	In addition, the low interest rate environment is impacting assumptions used in the development of reserve balances on current year issued policies, which results in an increase of reserves.
24090_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	Policyholder dividends have risen at a rate that corresponds with the growth rate in new international life insurance premiums.
24090_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	The Company issues long duration participating policies to foreign residents that are expected to pay dividends to policyholders based upon actual experience.
24090_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	Policyholder dividends are factored into the premiums and have no impact on profitability.
24090_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	Commission expense fluctuates in a direct relationship to new and renewal insurance premiums and has increased 4.9% in 2011 compared to 2010 as premium revenues have increased.
24090_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	Total general expenses decreased over the past several years on a consolidated basis as management has created efficiencies and improved processes.
24090_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	The decrease year to year was primarily related to lower audit, legal and consulting fees, as well as employee benefit cost reductions.
24090_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	We moved to a self insurance health plan for our employees in 2010 and have successfully decreased our overall benefit expenses.
24090_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	We perform an expense study on an annual basis, which reflects an enterprise-wide time study, and we adjust cost allocations among entities as needed based upon this review.
24090_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	In the current year, we increased expenses allocated to the Life Insurance segment and decreased expenses attributable to the Home Service segment by approximately $1.5 million.
24090_12_ITEM7_P56_S2	The allocation changes are reflected in the segment operations, but do not impact total expenses.
24090_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	Capitalized deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") were $29.4 million, $28.0 million and $27.1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009.
24090_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	These costs will vary based upon newly issued and renewal business.
24090_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	Significantly lower amounts are capitalized related to renewal business in correlation with the lower commissions paid on renewal business compared to first year.
24090_12_ITEM7_P57_S3	Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased in 2011 compared to 2010 amortization, as policy persistency had improved in 2010 compared to 2009, but declined in the Home Service segment in 2011, resulting in higher amortization.
24090_12_ITEM7_P57_S4	In addition, the prolonged low interest rate environment impacted the assumptions used in the development of the DAC asset for new policies issued in 2011.
24090_12_ITEM7_P57_S5	This resulted in a lower DAC balance and increased amortization in the current year by approximately $1.4 million.
24090_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	Cost of Customer Relationships Acquired and Other Intangibles .
24090_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	The 2009 higher amortization compared to 2010 and 2011 was related primarily to the ICC acquisition and greater amortization due to the increase in lapses on this new block of business.
24090_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	Federal income tax expense was $2.8 million, $4.1 million and $3.3 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of 25.0%, 21.0% and 15.8%, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	The Company established a tax valuation allowance related to other-than-temporary impairment ("OTTI") losses on its mutual funds of $6.9 million in 2008.
24090_12_ITEM7_P59_S2	The establishment of the valuation allowance had the effect of increasing tax expense.
24090_12_ITEM7_P59_S3	In 2009, $2.8 million of this allowance was released as a reduction of tax expense primarily due to the sale of approximately 42% of the mutual fund portfolio in 2009.
24090_12_ITEM7_P59_S4	The remaining $2.5 million valuation allowance was released in 2010, as the Company sold investments at a gain that enabled it to realize the tax basis losses, thereby making the valuation allowance no longer necessary.
24090_12_ITEM7_P59_S5	In addition, the fair value change related to outstanding warrants of $1.1 million and $0.2 million were reported as an increase in revenues in 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $3.2 million in 2009, which was not taxable and also impacted the corporate tax rate.
24090_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	Our business is comprised of three operating business segments, as detailed below.
24090_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	Our insurance operations are the primary focus of the Company, as those segments generate the majority of our income.
24090_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	The amount of insurance, number of policies, and average face amounts of policies issued during the periods indicated are shown below.
24090_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	These segments are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
24090_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	The Company evaluates profit and loss performance based on net income before federal income taxes.
24090_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	Our Life Insurance segment primarily issues ordinary whole life insurance in U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents in approximately 30 countries through approximately 2,300 independent marketing consultants, and domestically through almost 300 independent marketing firms and consultants throughout the United States.
24090_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	Premium revenues increased for 2011 compared to 2010 and 2009, due to higher international renewal premiums, which have experienced strong persistency as this block of insurance ages.
24090_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	First year premiums increased in the current year, reflecting improved new business production with increased sales of our endowment and whole life policies.
24090_12_ITEM7_P65_S2	Sales from Colombia, Ecuador, Taiwan and Venezuela represented the majority of the first year premium increase.
24090_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	Endowment sales represent a significant portion of new business sales internationally, as these products have gained in popularity over the past several years.
24090_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	In addition, most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision, which allows the policyholder to use cash value of a policy to pay premiums.
24090_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	The policy loan asset balance increased 10.5% year over year.
24090_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	Life Insurance premium breakout is detailed below.
24090_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	The following table sets forth premiums from our international life insurance business for the periods indicated.
24090_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	The following table sets forth our premiums by state from our domestic business for the periods indicated.
24090_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	A number of domestic life insurance companies we acquired had blocks of accident and health insurance policies, which we did not consider to be a core part of our business.
24090_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	We have ceded this business under a coinsurance agreement with an unaffiliated insurance company under which it assumes substantially all of our accident and health policies.
24090_12_ITEM7_P70_S2	The premium amounts ceded under the coinsurance agreement in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were $4.5 million, $5.3 million and $6.3 million, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	Net investment income has been negatively impacted by the low interest rate environment, which has resulted in declining portfolio yields, as discussed in the Consolidated Results of Operations above.
24090_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	Realized gains of $1.3 million and $6.6 were recognized in 2011 and 2010, due primarily to disposals of previously impaired equity mutual funds.
24090_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	Realized gains totaled $1.1 million in 2009 resulting from sales of available-for-sale fixed income securities, as discussed in the Consolidated Results of Operations above.
24090_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	A breakout of claims and surrender benefits is detailed below.
24090_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	Death claims expense was lower in 2011 due to fewer reported claims.
24090_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	In addition, 2011 results includes a release of incurred but not reported liability related to our claim experience calculation of $0.2 million.
24090_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	Mortality experience is closely monitored by the Company as a key performance indicator and these amounts were within expected levels.
24090_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	The increase in surrender expense is primarily related to our international business and is expected to increase over time due to the aging of this block of business.
24090_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	The majority of policy surrender benefits paid is attributable to our international business and was related to policies that have been in force over fifteen years, where surrender charges are no longer applicable.
24090_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	Endowment benefit expense results from the election by policyholders of a product feature that provides an annual benefit.
24090_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	This is a fixed benefit over the life of the contract, and this expense will increase with new sales and improved persistency.
24090_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	Other policy benefits increased in the current year due primarily to interest paid on premium deposits and dividend accumulations, as these policyholder liability accounts have increased.
24090_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	Increase in Future Policy Benefit Reserves .
24090_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	Policy benefit reserves in 2011 increased compared to the same periods in 2010, primarily due to increased sales of endowment products, which build up reserve balances more quickly compared to other life product sales.
24090_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	Endowment sales have become more popular relative to our international clientele in the past few years.
24090_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	Endowment sales totaled approximately $12.3 million, $9.4 million and $8.5 million, representing approximately 69.4%, 56.5% and 52.2% of total new first year premium in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	Policyholder dividends have risen at a rate that corresponds with the growth rate in new international life insurance premiums.
24090_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	The Company issues long duration participating policies to foreign residents that are expected to pay dividends to policyholders based upon actual experience.
24090_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	Policyholder dividends are factored into the premiums and have no impact on profitability.
24090_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	Capitalization and Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs .
24090_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	Capitalized costs increased, as commission related costs have increased in the current year compared to 2010.
24090_12_ITEM7_P83_S2	Amortization of DAC decreased in the current year by 2.9% from 2010 as the Company experienced improved persistency in this segment.
24090_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	Commission expense increase is directly related to the increase in premiums as noted above.
24090_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	First year policy premiums pay a higher commission rate than renewal policy premiums.
24090_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	Current year expenses reflect an increase that results from an annual time and expense study by segment that resulted in a cost increase of $1.5 million relative to allocated expenses in the life segment.
24090_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	The operating expenses increased from 2009 to 2010 due to renegotiating our agreement with Puritan Life Insurance Company of America, formerly Texas International Life Insurance Company, whereby we paid $0.2 million as well as an increase in credit card processing fees of approximately $0.2 million, as an increased number of policyholders are using our credit card payment option.
24090_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	Our Home Service Insurance segment provides pre-need and final expense ordinary life insurance and annuities to middle and lower income individuals primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	Our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through funeral homes and a home service marketing distribution system utilizing over 530 employees and independent agents.
24090_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	The premium increases were due to enhanced marketing efforts to promote the Home Service segment, as well as a SPFIC rate increase of approximately 5.8% that became effective January 1, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	The following table sets forth our premiums by state for the periods indicated.
24090_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	Net investment income has been negatively impacted by the low interest rate environment, which has resulted in declining portfolio yields as discussed in the Consolidated Results of Operations above.
24090_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	Net investment income for our home service insurance segment is summarized as follows:
24090_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	Realized Investment Gains (Losses), Net .
24090_12_ITEM7_P92_S1	Net realized losses of $0.6 million in 2011 are due primarily from an OTTI on one American Airlines debt security that totaled $70,000 due to the issuer filing bankruptcy, and a write-down of approximately $0.5 million related to investment real estate for an office building in Arkansas.
24090_12_ITEM7_P92_S2	We obtained an appraisal in 2011 that reflected a loss in fair value.
24090_12_ITEM7_P92_S3	Gains of $1.5 million in 2010 related primarily to sales of below investment grade securities that were added to the portfolio as part of an acquisition and had been previously impaired.
24090_12_ITEM7_P92_S4	Gains reported in 2009 totaled $6.6 million, which related primarily to sales of equity mutual funds that had been previously impaired.
24090_12_ITEM7_P92_S5	Impairments of $0.3 million were recorded in 2009 due to further declines in fair values relating to credit issues.
24090_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	A breakout of claims and surrender benefits is detailed below.
24090_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	Death claims expense was lower in 2011 due to fewer reported claims.
24090_12_ITEM7_P94_S1	In addition, 2011 results include a $0.6 million incurred but not reported release of liability related to our claim experience calculation.
24090_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	Mortality experience is closely monitored by the Company as a key performance indicator and these amounts were within expected levels.
24090_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	Surrender benefits have increased in 2011 compared to 2010, as the Home Service block grows, and is consistent with expectations for the current economic conditions.
24090_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	Increase in Future Policy Benefit Reserves .
24090_12_ITEM7_P97_S1	The reserves in 2009 included a decrease of $0.4 million resulting from a correction related to Ozark National Life Insurance Company, which was acquired in 2008.
24090_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	Other general expenses decreased in 2011 compared to 2010, due to an overall decrease in expenses and a reallocation of expenses that became effective January 1, 2011, which reduced the home service segment allocation by $1.5 million and increased the life segment allocation in the current year.
24090_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	Capitalization and Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs ("DAC") .
24090_12_ITEM7_P99_S1	DAC capitalization is directly correlated to fluctuations in first year commissions.
24090_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	Amortization in 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily because we experienced a higher lapse rate in the current year in this segment.
24090_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	We monitor lapse rates as a key component of our insurance operations.
24090_12_ITEM7_P101_S1	We are not aware of any information that would indicate this higher lapse rate will continue.
24090_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	Amortization in 2011 includes an adjustment that resulted in an increase of $0.3 million due to a refinement in an estimate using system generated information related to SPLIC assumptions.
24090_12_ITEM7_P102_S1	Amortization reported in 2010 is impacted by an adjustment that decreased amortization by $0.3 million in that reporting period.
24090_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	Overall, other non-insurance operations are relatively immaterial to the consolidated results, except for the fair value adjustment related to the Company's warrants to purchase Class A common stock.
24090_12_ITEM7_P103_S1	These amounts fluctuate due to the movement in our Class A common stock price and fair value calculation using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
24090_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	Financial stability and the prevention of capital erosion are important investment considerations for the Company.
24090_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	A primary investment goal is the conservation of assets due to the long-term nature of a significant portion of our liabilities.
24090_12_ITEM7_P105_S1	The administration of our investment portfolios is handled internally, pursuant to board-approved investment guidelines, with all trading activity approved by a committee of each entity s respective board of directors of our insurance company subsidiaries.
24090_12_ITEM7_P105_S2	The guidelines used require that bonds, both government and corporate, are of high quality, investment grade and comprise a majority of the investment portfolio.
24090_12_ITEM7_P105_S3	State insurance statutes prescribe the quality and percentage of the various types of investments that may be made by insurance companies and generally permit investment in qualified state, municipal, federal and foreign government obligations, high quality corporate bonds, preferred and common stock, mortgage loans and real estate within certain specified percentages.
24090_12_ITEM7_P105_S4	The assets selected are intended to mature in accordance with the average maturity of the insurance products and to provide the cash flow for our insurance company subsidiaries to meet their respective policyholder obligations.
24090_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	The following table shows the carrying value of our investments by investment category and cash and cash equivalents, and the percentage of each to total invested assets.
24090_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	(1) Includes $8.1 million and $13.2 million of U.S. Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprise in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	(2) Includes $123.5 million and $54.0 million of securities guaranteed by third parties for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	The current year decline in U.S. government-sponsored securities is due to call activity from this sector and reinvestment into fixed maturity corporate and municipal bond categories.
24090_12_ITEM7_P109_S1	The Company has increased investments in municipals primarily related to Build America taxable bonds, essential services and corporate issuer holdings in the utility sector.
24090_12_ITEM7_P110_S0	At December 31, 2011, investments in fixed maturity and equity securities were 90.3% of our total cash, and cash equivalents and investments.
24090_12_ITEM7_P110_S1	All of our fixed maturities were classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
24090_12_ITEM7_P110_S2	We had no fixed maturity or equity securities that were classified as trading securities at December 31, 2011 or 2010.
24090_12_ITEM7_P111_S0	As previously discussed, our investment portfolios have been impacted significantly by the low interest rate environment over the past several years.
24090_12_ITEM7_P111_S1	The following table shows investment yields by segment operations as of December 31 for each year presented.
24090_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	Yields on investment assets vary between segment operations due to different portfolio mixes in the segments.
24090_12_ITEM7_P112_S1	The life segment invests more in U.S. Government securities while the home service segment has a larger concentration in the corporate and municipal sectors.
24090_12_ITEM7_P112_S2	The following table shows the breakdown between segments by investment bond category based on amortized cost.
24090_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	Credit ratings reported for the periods indicated are assigned by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ("NRSRO") such as Moody s Investors Service, Standard Poor s and Fitch Ratings.
24090_12_ITEM7_P113_S1	A credit rating assigned by a NRSRO is a quality based rating, with AAA representing the highest quality and D the lowest, with BBB and above being considered investment grade.
24090_12_ITEM7_P113_S2	In addition, the Company may use credit ratings of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") Securities Valuation Office ("SVO") as assigned, if there is no NRSRO rating.
24090_12_ITEM7_P113_S3	Securities rated by the SVO are grouped in the equivalent NRSRO category as stated by the SVO and securities that are not rated by a NRSRO are included in the "other" category.
24090_12_ITEM7_P114_S0	The following table shows the distribution of the credit ratings of our portfolio of fixed maturity securities by carrying value.
24090_12_ITEM7_P115_S0	The significant change from fixed maturity securities held in AAA and AA ratings is due to the credit quality downgrade of the U.S. Government by Standard Poor's during the third quarter of 2011.
24090_12_ITEM7_P115_S1	This resulted in 193 securities with a carrying value totaling approximately $306.1 million as of December 31, 2011, moving from the AAA rating category into the AA category for the 2011 reporting period.
24090_12_ITEM7_P116_S0	In addition, the Company made new investments in the AA credit category of taxable municipals and corporate bonds, primarily public utility issuers with an average maturity of seven years.
24090_12_ITEM7_P116_S1	The increase in non-investment grade securities was due to downgrades of issuers in the current period, as the Company does not purchase below investment grade securities.
24090_12_ITEM7_P117_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the Company held municipal securities that include third party guarantees.
24090_12_ITEM7_P117_S1	Detailed below is a presentation by NRSRO rating of our municipal holdings by funding type.
24090_12_ITEM7_P118_S0	The Company held investments in special revenue bonds that had a greater than 10% exposure based upon activity as of December 31, 2011 as shown in the table below.
24090_12_ITEM7_P119_S0	The tables below represent the Company s detailed exposure of municipal holdings in Louisiana and Texas, which exceed 10% of the total municipal portfolio as of December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM7_P120_S0	The Company invests in municipal securities of issuers in the state of Louisiana and receives a credit that reduces its premium tax liability in that state.
24090_12_ITEM7_P120_S1	At December 31, 2011, total holdings of municipal securities in Louisiana represented 25.1% of all municipal holdings based upon fair value.
24090_12_ITEM7_P120_S2	The Company also holds 21.3% of its municipal holdings in Texas issuers.
24090_12_ITEM7_P121_S0	There were no other states or individual issuer holdings that represented or exceeded 10% of the total municipal portfolio as of December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM7_P122_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of our fixed maturity and equity securities at least quarterly.
24090_12_ITEM7_P123_S0	The Company monitors all debt and equity securities on an on-going basis relative to changes in credit ratings, market prices, earnings trends and financial performance, in addition to specific region or industry reviews.
24090_12_ITEM7_P124_S0	The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on a case-by-case evaluation of underlying reasons for the decline in fair value.
24090_12_ITEM7_P125_S0	The Company determines other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) by reviewing all relevant evidence related to the specific security issuer as well as the Company's intent to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost.
24090_12_ITEM7_P126_S0	When an OTTI has occurred, the amount of the OTTI recognized in earnings depends on whether the Company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis.
24090_12_ITEM7_P126_S1	If the Company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, an OTTI is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_12_ITEM7_P126_S2	If the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Company is required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the OTTI will be separated into the following: a) the amount representing the credit loss; and b) the amount related to all other factors.
24090_12_ITEM7_P126_S3	The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings.
24090_12_ITEM7_P126_S4	The amount of the total OTTI related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_12_ITEM7_P126_S5	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_12_ITEM7_P126_S6	The new amortized cost is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value.
24090_12_ITEM7_P127_S0	The Company recorded an OTTI of $70,000 in 2011 related to one American Airlines bond holding, as the issuer filed for bankruptcy.
24090_12_ITEM7_P127_S1	An additional impairment of $27,000 was recorded in 2010 to write a security down to zero carrying value.
24090_12_ITEM7_P127_S2	In 2009, the Company impaired three bonds for $0.1 million and a number of common stocks totaling $0.2 million.
24090_12_ITEM7_P127_S3	These 2009 impairments resulted from declines due to credit quality of the issuers and have been reflected as a realized loss in the accompanying income statement.
24090_12_ITEM7_P127_S4	Based upon our emphasis on investing in fixed maturity securities primarily composed of obligations of U.S. Government-sponsored corporations and our analysis of whether declines in fair value below cost are temporary or other-than-temporary, management believes that our investments in fixed maturity investments at December 31, 2011 were not impaired, and no additional other-than-temporary losses need to be recorded.
24090_12_ITEM7_P128_S0	Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities available-for-sale amounted to $3.0 million as of December 31, 2011 and $13.7 million as of December 31, 2010.
24090_12_ITEM7_P128_S1	This decrease in gross unrealized losses was due to an increase in the interest rate environment.
24090_12_ITEM7_P128_S2	There were $0.5 million of gross unrealized losses on equity securities as of December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM7_P129_S0	In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company sold equity mutual fund holdings from the Life and Home Service segments and recorded realized gains of $1.3 million, $6.4 million and $4.9 million due to market recovery since impairment at December 31, 2008.
24090_12_ITEM7_P130_S0	As is customary among insurance companies, our insurance company subsidiaries reinsure with other companies portions of the life insurance risks they underwrite.
24090_12_ITEM7_P130_S1	A primary purpose of reinsurance agreements is to enable an insurance company to reduce the amount of risk on any particular life and, by reinsuring the amount exceeding the maximum amount the insurance company is willing to retain, to insure individuals in amounts larger than it could without such agreements.
24090_12_ITEM7_P130_S2	Even though a portion of the risk may be reinsured, our insurance company subsidiaries remain liable to perform all the obligations imposed by the policies issued by them and could be liable if their reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements.
24090_12_ITEM7_P131_S0	We believe we have established appropriate reinsurance coverage based upon our net retained insured liabilities compared to our surplus.
24090_12_ITEM7_P132_S0	The effect of reinsurance on premiums is as follows.
24090_12_ITEM7_P133_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries monitor the solvency of their reinsurers in seeking to minimize the risk of loss in the event of default by a reinsurer.
24090_12_ITEM7_P134_S0	The primary reinsurers of our insurance subsidiaries are large, well-capitalized entities.
24090_12_ITEM7_P135_S0	The effect of reinsurance on life insurance in force is as follows.
24090_12_ITEM7_P136_S0	Virtually all of the Company's non-credit accident and health insurance has been reinsured and is administered by Puritan Life Insurance Company of America, an unaffiliated party.
24090_12_ITEM7_P136_S1	The reinsurance recoverables under this agreement are collateralized by assets held in a trust for the benefit of the reinsured policies.
24090_12_ITEM7_P137_S0	The Company monitors the credit ratings of our life and property reinsurers.
24090_12_ITEM7_P137_S1	The ratings by A.M. Best Company range from B+ (Good) to A+ (Superior).
24090_12_ITEM7_P138_S0	SPFIC has first and second event catastrophe reinsurance coverage of $10.0 million per event and a retention level of $500,000 per event.
24090_12_ITEM7_P138_S1	Thus, the first $500,000 of incurred claims and any claims in excess of $10.0 million are SPFIC's responsibility.
24090_12_ITEM7_P139_S0	The reinsurance premium for first event catastrophe reinsurance was $1,128,000, $1,130,000 and $1,075,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM7_P140_S0	Liquidity refers to a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the needs of its operations.
24090_12_ITEM7_P140_S1	Liquidity is managed on insurance operations to ensure stable and reliable sources of cash flows to meet obligations and is provided by a variety of sources.
24090_12_ITEM7_P141_S0	Our liquidity requirements are met primarily by funds provided from operations.
24090_12_ITEM7_P141_S1	Premium deposits and revenues, investment income and investment maturities are the primary sources of funds, while investment purchases, policy benefits, and operating expenses are the primary uses of funds.
24090_12_ITEM7_P141_S2	We historically have not had to liquidate investments to provide cash flow, and there were no liquidity issues in 2011 or 2010.
24090_12_ITEM7_P141_S3	Our investments consist of 61.3% of marketable debt securities and 5.5% of equity securities classified as available-for-sale that could be readily converted to cash for liquidity needs.
24090_12_ITEM7_P142_S0	A primary liquidity concern is the risk of an extraordinary level of early policyholder withdrawals.
24090_12_ITEM7_P142_S1	We include provisions within our insurance policies, such as surrender charges, that help limit and discourage early withdrawals.
24090_12_ITEM7_P142_S2	Since these contractual withdrawals, as well as the level of surrenders experienced, have been largely consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management, our associated cash outflows have, historically, not had an adverse impact on our overall liquidity.
24090_12_ITEM7_P143_S0	Individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy.
24090_12_ITEM7_P143_S1	Cash flow projections and cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios are also performed annually to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy.
24090_12_ITEM7_P144_S0	We currently anticipate that available liquidity sources and future cash flows will be adequate to meet our needs for funds.
24090_12_ITEM7_P145_S0	Cash flows from our insurance operations historically have been sufficient to meet current needs.
24090_12_ITEM7_P145_S1	Cash flows from operating activities were $64.3 million, $60.5 million and $52.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM7_P145_S2	We have traditionally also had significant cash flows from both scheduled and unscheduled fixed maturity security calls, maturities, redemptions, and prepayments, which totaled $283.3 million, $387.4 million and $292.7 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009.
24090_12_ITEM7_P145_S3	These cash flows, for the most part, are reinvested in fixed income securities.
24090_12_ITEM7_P145_S4	Net cash outflows from investment activity totaled $85.1 million, $62.1 million and $68.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM7_P145_S5	The outflows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily related to the investment of excess cash and cash equivalents generated from operations during 2011.
24090_12_ITEM7_P145_S6	The Company's cash flows from financing activities were $4.3 million in 2011, $2.6 million in 2010 and $1.5 million in 2009.
24090_12_ITEM7_P146_S0	The NAIC has established minimum capital requirements in the form of RBC.
24090_12_ITEM7_P146_S1	RBC considers the type of business written by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company's business to develop a minimum level of capital called "Authorized Control Level Risk-based Capital" and compares this level to an adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves.
24090_12_ITEM7_P146_S2	Should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk-based capital fall below 200%, a series of remedial actions by the affected company would be required.
24090_12_ITEM7_P147_S0	At December 31, 2011, all of our insurance subsidiaries were above the required minimum RBC levels.
24090_12_ITEM7_P148_S0	In 2011 and 2010, CICA contributed 150,000 shares of Citizens, Inc.
24090_12_ITEM7_P148_S1	Class A common stock to CNLIC as a capital contribution due to minimum capital and surplus considerations.
24090_12_ITEM7_P148_S2	The contributed shares had a fair market contributed value of $1.1 million and $1.0 million.
24090_12_ITEM7_P148_S3	These shares were subsequently purchased by Citizens, Inc., the ultimate parent, for $1.2 million and $1.0 million cash in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM7_P148_S4	These transactions have been eliminated under consolidation accounting rules.
24090_12_ITEM7_P149_S0	We have committed to the following contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 with the payments due by the period indicated below:
24090_12_ITEM7_P150_S0	The payments related to the future policy benefits and policy claims payable reflected in the table above have been projected utilizing assumptions based upon our historical experience and anticipated future experience.
24090_12_ITEM7_P151_S0	The Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2011 and, therefore, does not expect any future effects on the Company's financial condition related to any such arrangements.
24090_12_ITEM7_P152_S0	We do not utilize special purpose entities as investment vehicles, nor are there any such entities in which we have an investment that engages in speculative activities of any nature, and we do not use such investments to hedge our investment positions.
24090_12_ITEM7_P153_S0	Citizens is a holding company and has had minimal operations of its own.
24090_12_ITEM7_P153_S1	Our assets consist of the capital stock of our subsidiaries, cash, fixed income securities, mutual funds and investment real estate.
24090_12_ITEM7_P153_S2	Accordingly, our cash flows depend upon the availability of statutorily permissible payments, primarily payments under management agreements from our two primary life insurance subsidiaries, CICA and SPLIC.
24090_12_ITEM7_P153_S3	The ability to make payments is limited by applicable laws and regulations of Colorado, CICA's state of domicile, and Louisiana, SPLIC's state of domicile, which subject insurance operations to significant regulatory restrictions.
24090_12_ITEM7_P153_S4	These laws and regulations require, among other things, that these insurance subsidiaries maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company.
24090_12_ITEM7_P154_S0	We historically have not relied upon dividends from subsidiaries for our cash flow needs.
24090_12_ITEM7_P154_S1	However, CICA and SPLIC both dividend available funds from time to time in relation to new acquisition target strategies.
24090_12_ITEM7_P155_S0	CICA has contributed amounts in the form of dividends to Citizens totaling $6.8 million, $9.3 million and $10.5 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM7_P156_S0	Additionally, a substantial portion of our international policyholders invest their policy cash dividends and benefits in our Class A common stock through our Stock Investment Plan (the Plan ).
24090_12_ITEM7_P156_S1	Once a policyholder elects to participate in the Plan, their policy benefits can be used to purchase Citizens Class A common stock.
24090_12_ITEM7_P156_S2	In addition, our existing holders of Class A common stock, our employees and our independent consultants are eligible to participate in the Plan.
24090_12_ITEM7_P156_S3	In 2011, 3,150,043 shares were purchased in the open market under the Plan and 1,131,196 shares were sold in the open market under the Plan.
24090_12_ITEM7_P157_S0	If fewer policyholders elect to participate in the Plan, or if our international premium collections were to decrease as a result of regulatory or marketing impediments, the trading volume of our Class A common stock may decline from its present levels.
24090_12_ITEM7_P158_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
24090_12_ITEM7_P158_S1	Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM7_P158_S2	While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available.
24090_12_ITEM7_P158_S3	Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
24090_12_ITEM7_P159_S0	Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.
24090_12_ITEM7_P160_S0	No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting policies.
24090_12_ITEM7_P161_S0	Our critical accounting policies are as follows:
24090_12_ITEM7_P162_S0	Future policy benefit reserves have been computed by the net level premium method with assumptions as to investment yields, dividends on participating business, mortality and withdrawals based upon our experience.
24090_12_ITEM7_P162_S1	The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of policy liabilities and the increase in future policy benefit reserves.
24090_12_ITEM7_P162_S2	Management's judgments and estimates for future policy benefit reserves provide for possible unfavorable deviation.
24090_12_ITEM7_P163_S0	We continue to use the original assumptions (including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation) in subsequent periods to determine the changes in the liability for future policy benefits (the "lock-in concept ) unless a premium deficiency exists.
24090_12_ITEM7_P163_S1	Management monitors these assumptions and has determined that a premium deficiency did not exist as of December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM7_P163_S2	Management believes that our policy liabilities and increase in future policy benefit reserves as of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are based upon assumptions, including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation, that do not warrant revision.
24090_12_ITEM7_P164_S0	Acquisition costs, consisting of commissions and policy issuance, underwriting and agency expenses that relate to and vary with the production of new business, are deferred.
24090_12_ITEM7_P164_S1	These deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized primarily over the estimated premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of the annual premium recognized to the total premium revenue anticipated, using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_12_ITEM7_P165_S0	We utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance.
24090_12_ITEM7_P165_S1	The factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period.
24090_12_ITEM7_P165_S2	The factor method ensures that policies that lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation.
24090_12_ITEM7_P165_S3	The factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value, provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors.
24090_12_ITEM7_P166_S0	Inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred, the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_12_ITEM7_P166_S1	Approximately 90% of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year excess commissions.
24090_12_ITEM7_P166_S2	The remaining 10% are attributed to costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new insurance business.
24090_12_ITEM7_P166_S3	Those costs generally include costs related to the production, underwriting and issuance of new business.
24090_12_ITEM7_P167_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_12_ITEM7_P167_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 30 years.
24090_12_ITEM7_P167_S2	The available premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated.
24090_12_ITEM7_P167_S3	The deferred policy acquisition costs are then evaluated over two methods utilizing reasonable assumptions and two other methods using pessimistic assumptions.
24090_12_ITEM7_P167_S4	The two methods using reasonable assumptions illustrate an early-deferred policy acquisition recoverability period.
24090_12_ITEM7_P167_S5	The two methods utilizing pessimistic assumptions still support early recoverability of our aggregate deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_12_ITEM7_P168_S0	Management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value.
24090_12_ITEM7_P168_S1	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on capitalized expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business, utilization of the factor method and annual recoverability testing.
24090_12_ITEM7_P169_S0	Cost of Customer Relationships Acquired ("CCRA") is established when we purchase a block of insurance.
24090_12_ITEM7_P169_S1	CCRA is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_12_ITEM7_P170_S0	We utilize various methods to determine the amount of the ending asset balance, including a static model and a dynamic model.
24090_12_ITEM7_P170_S1	Inherent in the amortization of CCRA are certain management judgments about the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_12_ITEM7_P170_S2	The assumptions used are based upon interest, mortality and lapses at the time of purchase.
24090_12_ITEM7_P171_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_12_ITEM7_P171_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next thirty years.
24090_12_ITEM7_P171_S2	The CCRA is then evaluated utilizing reasonable assumptions.
24090_12_ITEM7_P171_S3	Management believes our CCRA and related amortization is recoverable for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
24090_12_ITEM7_P171_S4	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on estimated future results of the block and our annual recoverability testing.
24090_12_ITEM7_P172_S0	Current accounting guidance requires that goodwill balances be reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event has occurred.
24090_12_ITEM7_P173_S0	A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment on one level below an operating segment.
24090_12_ITEM7_P173_S1	Most of the Company's reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated, are equivalent to the Company's operating segment, as there is no discrete financial information available for the separate components of the segment or all of the components of the segment have similar economic characteristics.
24090_12_ITEM7_P174_S0	The goodwill impairment test follows a two step process as defined under current accounting guidance.
24090_12_ITEM7_P175_S0	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
24090_12_ITEM7_P175_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment.
24090_12_ITEM7_P175_S2	In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value.
24090_12_ITEM7_P175_S3	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
24090_12_ITEM7_P176_S0	Management's determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations, peer company price to earnings multiples, the level of the Company's Class A common stock price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit.
24090_12_ITEM7_P176_S1	Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections.
24090_12_ITEM7_P177_S0	The evaluation of securities for impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings.
24090_12_ITEM7_P177_S1	The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition or future prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period.
24090_12_ITEM7_P178_S0	Based upon current accounting guidance, investment securities must be classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading.
24090_12_ITEM7_P178_S1	Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase.
24090_12_ITEM7_P179_S0	The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities.
24090_12_ITEM7_P179_S1	Fixed maturity securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the Company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity.
24090_12_ITEM7_P179_S2	Securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings until realized.
24090_12_ITEM7_P180_S0	The Company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if an OTTI exists pursuant to the accounting guidelines.
24090_12_ITEM7_P180_S1	In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the ability and intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
24090_12_ITEM7_P180_S2	In analyzing an issuer's financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the Federal government or its agencies, by government-sponsored agencies, or whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and reviews of the issuer's financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM7_P181_S0	If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, management must then determine the amount of OTTI to be recognized in earnings.
24090_12_ITEM7_P181_S1	If management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.
24090_12_ITEM7_P181_S2	The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.
24090_12_ITEM7_P181_S3	The amount of OTTI related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_12_ITEM7_P181_S4	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_12_ITEM7_P181_S5	If management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_12_ITEM7_P181_S6	Any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain (as other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold.
24090_12_ITEM7_P182_S0	The Company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions, future market movements, business plan changes, or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time.
24090_12_ITEM7_P183_S0	Premiums on life and accident and health policies are reported as earned when due or, for short duration contracts, over the contract period on a pro rata basis.
24090_12_ITEM7_P183_S1	Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in recognition of profits over the estimated life of the contracts.
24090_12_ITEM7_P183_S2	This matching is accomplished by means of provisions for future benefits and the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_12_ITEM7_P184_S0	Annuities are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest bearing financial instruments.
24090_12_ITEM7_P185_S0	Our primary annuity products do not include fees or other such charges.
24090_12_ITEM7_P186_S0	A deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recorded only if a determination is made that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax treatment on which the deferred tax item depends will be sustained in the event of an audit.
24090_12_ITEM7_P186_S1	These determinations inherently involve management's judgment.
24090_12_ITEM7_P186_S2	In addition, the Company must record a tax valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
24090_12_ITEM7_P186_S3	This valuation allowance is in essence a contra account to the deferred tax asset.
24090_12_ITEM7_P186_S4	Management must determine the portion of the deferred tax asset and resulting tax benefit that may not be realized based upon judgment of expected outcomes.
24090_12_ITEM7_P187_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_12_ITEM7_P187_S1	Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position.
24090_12_ITEM7_P188_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The nature of our business exposes us to market risk relative to our invested assets and policy liabilities.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Market risk is the risk of loss that may occur when changes in interest rates and public equity prices adversely affect the value of our invested assets.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Interest rate risk is our primary market risk exposure.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can affect the fair value of our investments.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio generally increases when interest rates decrease and decreases when interest rates increase.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The following table summarizes net unrealized gains and losses for the periods indicated.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our exposure to interest rate changes results from our significant holdings of fixed maturity investments, policy loans and mortgage loans on real estate, all of which comprised over 89.7% of our cash and investment portfolio as of December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	These investments are mainly exposed to changes in U.S. Treasury rates.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Our fixed maturities investments include U.S. Government-sponsored corporations, U.S. Government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, state and municipal bonds, and corporate bonds.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Approximately 41.4% of the fixed maturities we owned at market value on December 31, 2011 are instruments of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, or are backed by U.S. Government agencies.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	To manage interest risk, we perform periodic projections of asset and liability cash flows to evaluate the potential sensitivity of our investments and liabilities.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We assess interest rate sensitivity on an annual basis with respect to our fixed maturities investments using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward shifts in the prevailing interest rates.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The Company performed an analysis of fair values changes using assumed 100 basis point upward shifts in interest rates, noting that the fair value of our fixed maturity investment portfolio of $744.3 million would decrease approximately $36 million to a fair value of $708 million upon a 100 basis point increase.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The following table shows the effects on the fair values of our fixed maturity investments based upon these scenarios.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	While the test scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed-income markets, it is a near-term change that illustrates the potential impact of such events.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Due to the composition of our book of insurance business, we believe it is unlikely we would encounter large surrender activity due to an interest rate increase that would force us to dispose of our fixed maturities at a loss.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Our fixed maturity portfolio is exposed to call risk as a significant portion of the current holdings are callable.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P7_S1	A decreasing interest rate environment can result in increased call activity as experienced over the past several years, and an increasing rate environment will likely result in securities being paid at their stated maturity.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P8_S0	There are no fixed maturities or other investments that we classify as trading instruments.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Approximately 69.1% of fixed maturities were held in available-for-sale and 30.9% in held-to-maturity based upon fair value at December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P9_S0	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no investments in derivative instruments, subprime loans or CDOs (collateralized debt obligations).
24090_12_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Changes in the level or volatility of equity prices affect the value of equity securities we hold as investments.
24090_12_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Our equity investments portfolio represented 5.3% of our total investments at December 31, 2011, with 95.7% invested in diversified equity and bond mutual funds.

24090_12_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Citizens, Inc.:
24090_12_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We have audited Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
24090_12_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting .
24090_12_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
24090_12_ITEM9A_P7_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
24090_12_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

24090_12_ITEM9A_P7_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
24090_12_ITEM9A_P8_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
24090_12_ITEM9A_P8_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
24090_12_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
24090_12_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
24090_12_ITEM9A_P10_S0	In our opinion, Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.

24090_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	Investment securities are classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading.
24090_12_ITEM15_P27_S1	Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase.
24090_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities.
24090_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	Fixed maturity securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the Company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity.
24090_12_ITEM15_P28_S2	Securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings until realized.
24090_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	Fixed maturities consist primarily of bonds classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.

24090_12_ITEM15_P29_S2	Equity securities (including non-redeemable preferred stock) are considered available-for-sale and are reported at fair value.

24090_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	The Company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if an other-than-temporary impairment ("OTTI") exists pursuant to the accounting guidelines.
24090_12_ITEM15_P31_S1	In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the ability and intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
24090_12_ITEM15_P31_S2	In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the Federal government or its agencies, by government-sponsored agencies, or whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and reviews of the issuer s financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, management must then determine the amount of OTTI to be recognized in earnings.
24090_12_ITEM15_P32_S1	If management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.
24090_12_ITEM15_P32_S2	The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.
24090_12_ITEM15_P32_S3	The amount of OTTI related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_12_ITEM15_P32_S4	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_12_ITEM15_P32_S5	If management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_12_ITEM15_P32_S6	Any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain (as other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold.
24090_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	The Company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions, future market movements, business plan changes, or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time.
24090_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	Mortgage loans on real estate and policy loans are reported at unpaid principal balances.
24090_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	Real estate and other long-term investments consist primarily of land and buildings that are recorded at depreciated cost.
24090_12_ITEM15_P35_S1	If the fair value of the real estate is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized and charged to earnings.
24090_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method.
24090_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	Dividend and interest income is recognized when earned.
24090_12_ITEM15_P37_S1	Realized gains and losses are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold.
24090_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	The Company had cash equivalents and fixed maturities with an aggregate fair value of $10.5 million and $11.1 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, on deposit with various state regulatory authorities to fulfill statutory requirements.
24090_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	Premiums on life policies are recognized as earned when due.
24090_12_ITEM15_P39_S1	Due premiums on the balance sheet are net of allowances.
24090_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	Accident and health policies are recognized as revenue over the contract period on a pro rata basis.
24090_12_ITEM15_P40_S1	Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in the recognition of profits over the estimated lives of the contracts.
24090_12_ITEM15_P40_S2	This matching is accomplished by means of a provision for future policy benefits and the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	Annuity policies, primarily flexible premium fixed annuity products, are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest bearing financial instruments.
24090_12_ITEM15_P41_S1	Premium receipts are not reported as revenue, rather as deposit liabilities to annuity contracts.
24090_12_ITEM15_P41_S2	The annuity products issued do not include fees or other such charges.
24090_12_ITEM15_P42_S0	Acquisition costs, consisting of commissions and policy issuance, underwriting and agent convention expenses that are primarily related to and vary with the production of new and renewal business, have been deferred.
24090_12_ITEM15_P42_S1	These deferred amounts, referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC"), are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and amortized to income in a systematic manner, based on related contract revenues or gross profits as appropriate.
24090_12_ITEM15_P43_S0	Traditional life insurance and accident and health insurance acquisition costs are being amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing future policy benefit liabilities.
24090_12_ITEM15_P43_S1	For universal life type contracts and investment contracts that include significant surrender charges or that yield significant revenues from sources other than the investment contract holders' funds, the deferred contract acquisition cost amortization is matched to the recognition of gross profit.
24090_12_ITEM15_P43_S2	The effect on the DAC asset that would result from realization of unrealized gains or losses is recognized with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income in consolidated stockholders' equity.
24090_12_ITEM15_P44_S0	If an internal replacement of insurance or investment contract modification substantially changes a contract as defined in current accounting guidance, then the DAC is written off immediately through income and any new deferrable costs associated with the new replacement are deferred.
24090_12_ITEM15_P44_S1	If a contract modification does not substantially change the contract, the DAC amortization on the original contract will continue and any acquisition costs associated with the related modification are immediately expensed.
24090_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	We utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance.
24090_12_ITEM15_P45_S1	The factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period.
24090_12_ITEM15_P45_S2	The factor method ensures that policies lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation.
24090_12_ITEM15_P45_S3	The factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value, provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors.
24090_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	Inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred, the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_12_ITEM15_P46_S1	Approximately 90% of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year excess commissions.
24090_12_ITEM15_P46_S2	The remaining 10% are attributed to costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new insurance business.
24090_12_ITEM15_P46_S3	Those costs generally include costs related to the production, underwriting and issuance of new business.
24090_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_12_ITEM15_P47_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less the benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 30 years.
24090_12_ITEM15_P47_S2	The available premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated.
24090_12_ITEM15_P47_S3	The deferred policy acquisition costs are then evaluated over two methods utilizing reasonable assumptions and two other methods using pessimistic assumptions.
24090_12_ITEM15_P48_S0	Management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value.
24090_12_ITEM15_P48_S1	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on capitalized expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business, utilization of the factor method and annual recoverability testing.
24090_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	The components of deferred acquisition costs from year to year are summarized as follows:
24090_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	Cost of customer relationships acquired ("CCRA") is established when we purchase a block of insurance.
24090_12_ITEM15_P50_S1	CCRA is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	We utilize various methods to determine the amount of the ending asset balance, including a static model and a dynamic model.
24090_12_ITEM15_P51_S1	Inherent in the amortization of CCRA are certain management judgments about the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_12_ITEM15_P51_S2	The assumptions used are based upon interest, mortality and lapses at the time of purchase.
24090_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_12_ITEM15_P52_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less the benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next thirty years.
24090_12_ITEM15_P52_S2	The CCRA is then evaluated utilizing reasonable assumptions.
24090_12_ITEM15_P52_S3	Management believes that our CCRA and related amortization is recoverable for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
24090_12_ITEM15_P52_S4	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on estimated future results of the block and our annual recoverability testing.
24090_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	Cost of customer relationships acquired relative to purchased blocks of insurance is summarized as follows:
24090_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	The increase in the effects of unrealized gains and losses on CCRA in 2011 is related to the increase on unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities in 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	Estimated amortization of cost of customer relationship acquired in each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows.
24090_12_ITEM15_P55_S1	Actual future amortization will differ from these estimates due to variances from estimated future withdrawal assumptions.
24090_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	The value of CCRA in our various acquisitions, which is included in cost of customer relationships acquired in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, was determined based on the present value of future profits discounted at annual rates ranging from 4.5% to 8.5%.
24090_12_ITEM15_P57_S0	Future policy benefit reserves for traditional life insurance and accident and health insurance contract benefits and expenses are computed using a net level premium method, with assumptions as to investment yields, dividends on participating business, mortality and withdrawals based upon our experience, modified as necessary to reflect anticipated trends and to include provisions for possible unfavorable deviations.
24090_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	The accrued account balance for non-traditional life insurance and investment contracts is computed as deposits net of withdrawals made by the contract holder, plus amounts credited based on contract specifications, less contract fees and charges assessed, plus any additional interest.
24090_12_ITEM15_P58_S1	Annuity interest crediting rates range from 3.0% to 5.5% annually.
24090_12_ITEM15_P58_S2	Benefits and expenses are charged against the account balance to recognize costs as incurred over the estimated lives of the contracts.
24090_12_ITEM15_P58_S3	Expenses include interest credited to contract account balances and benefits paid in excess of contract account balances.
24090_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	Unpaid claims on accident and health policies represent the estimated liability for benefit expenses, both reported but not paid and incurred but not reported to the Company.
24090_12_ITEM15_P59_S1	Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated using individual case basis valuations and statistical analyses.
24090_12_ITEM15_P59_S2	Those estimates are subject to the effects of trends in claim severity and frequency.
24090_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	Anticipated investment income is not considered in determining whether a premium deficiency exists with respect to short-duration contracts.
24090_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	Premium deposits accrue interest at rates ranging from 4.0% to 8.25% per annum.
24090_12_ITEM15_P61_S1	The cost of insurance is included in the premium when collected and interest is credited annually to deposit accounts.
24090_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	The development of liabilities for future policy benefits requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding mortality, morbidity, lapse, expense, and investment experience.
24090_12_ITEM15_P62_S1	These estimates are based primarily on historical experience and future expectations of mortality, morbidity, expense, persistency, and investment assumptions.
24090_12_ITEM15_P62_S2	Actual results could differ materially from estimates.
24090_12_ITEM15_P62_S3	We monitor actual experience and revise assumptions as necessary.
24090_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	The Company corrected two valuation database discrepancies in 2010 that resulted in a decrease to reserves of $559,000.
24090_12_ITEM15_P63_S1	There was a value per unit error related to fully paid up policies of CICA under one plan in duration twenty-one resulting in a reserve overstatement amounting to $508,000, with approximately $475,000 related to prior years, and another insurance plan of CICA where surrender charges were not properly recorded, which also overstated reserves by $51,000, with approximately $48,000 related to prior years.
24090_12_ITEM15_P63_S2	The correction of these errors resulted in an increase of 2010 pre-tax income of $523,000 and $339,950 increase in net income.
24090_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	Goodwill is the difference between the purchase price in a business combination and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, and is not amortized.
24090_12_ITEM15_P64_S1	Other intangible assets include various state insurance licenses, which have been determined to have indefinite useful lives and, therefore, are not amortized.
24090_12_ITEM15_P64_S2	Both goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are subject to annual impairment analyses.
24090_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	The goodwill impairment test uses a two step process as set forth under current accounting guidance.
24090_12_ITEM15_P65_S1	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
24090_12_ITEM15_P65_S2	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment.
24090_12_ITEM15_P65_S3	In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value.
24090_12_ITEM15_P65_S4	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
24090_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	Management's determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations, peer company price to earnings multiples, the level of the Company's Class A common stock price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit.
24090_12_ITEM15_P66_S1	Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections.
24090_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the Company had goodwill of $12.7 million allocated to the Life Insurance segment and $4.5 million allocated to the Home Service Insurance segment.
24090_12_ITEM15_P67_S1	The Company completes its annual goodwill assessment for the individual reporting units within the Life Insurance segment and Home Service Insurance segment as of December 31 each year.
24090_12_ITEM15_P67_S2	There was no impairment of goodwill in 2011, 2010 or 2009.
24090_12_ITEM15_P68_S0	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, participating business approximated 59.2% and 58.7%, respectively, of direct life insurance in force.
24090_12_ITEM15_P69_S0	Future policy benefits on participating policies are estimated based on net level premium reserves for death and endowment policy benefits ranging from 3% to 8%, and the cash surrender values described in such contracts.
24090_12_ITEM15_P70_S0	The scaling rate used for the 2011 portfolio ranged between 3.4% up to 3.9% over 10 years and then going up to 5% at 20 years and remaining there for the duration.
24090_12_ITEM15_P71_S0	Earnings and dividends on participating policies are allocated based on policies in force.
24090_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	Policyholder dividends are determined based on the discretion of the Board of Directors of the policy issuing subsidiary.
24090_12_ITEM15_P72_S1	Policyholder dividends are accrued over the premium paying periods of the insurance contract.
24090_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.
24090_12_ITEM15_P73_S1	Diluted earnings per share are computed under the if-converted method for convertible securities and the treasury stock method for warrants, giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock, including options, warrants and convertible/redeemable preferred stock.
24090_12_ITEM15_P73_S2	The basic and diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock are one half the earnings per share of the Class A common stock.
24090_12_ITEM15_P74_S0	During 2011, the warrants associated with the Series A Preferred Stock were either exercised or expired on July 12, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P74_S1	Shares issued from the exercise of warrants totaled 255,216, and 1,989 shares were issued under a cashless provision in the Preferred Stock contract.
24090_12_ITEM15_P74_S2	Additionally, 9,487 shares were issued from the exercise of warrants at various dates in 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P74_S3	In 2009, we issued 1.7 million Class A common shares for the mandatory redemption of our Company Series A Preferred Stock.
24090_12_ITEM15_P74_S4	Additionally, 10,000 shares of Class A common stock were issued upon one exercise of warrants.
24090_12_ITEM15_P74_S5	During 2009, the Company also issued 1.3 million shares of Class A common stock for the acquisition of ICC.
24090_12_ITEM15_P75_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
24090_12_ITEM15_P76_S0	The Series A-1 and A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock that was outstanding during 2009 was anti-dilutive because the amount of the dividend and accretion of deferred issuance costs and discounts for the year ended December 31, 2009 per Class A common stock share obtainable on conversion exceed basic income per share available to common stockholders.
24090_12_ITEM15_P77_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
24090_12_ITEM15_P77_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered.
24090_12_ITEM15_P78_S0	A deferred tax asset is recorded only if a determination is made that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax treatment on which the deferred tax asset depends will be sustained in the event of an audit.
24090_12_ITEM15_P78_S1	These determinations inherently involve management's judgment.
24090_12_ITEM15_P78_S2	In addition, the Company must record a tax valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
24090_12_ITEM15_P78_S3	This valuation allowance is in essence a contra account to the deferred tax asset.
24090_12_ITEM15_P78_S4	Management must determine the portion of the deferred tax asset and resulting tax benefit that may not be realized based upon judgment of expected outcomes.
24090_12_ITEM15_P79_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_12_ITEM15_P79_S1	Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position.
24090_12_ITEM15_P80_S0	The table below details the Company's tax valuation allowance in deferred income taxes payable.
24090_12_ITEM15_P81_S0	Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
24090_12_ITEM15_P81_S1	Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to thirty years.
24090_12_ITEM15_P82_S0	We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated life of the improvements.
24090_12_ITEM15_P82_S1	The Company has no capital leases.
24090_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	Following is a summary of property and equipment.
24090_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	Reinsurance recoverable includes expected reimbursements for policyholder claim amounts in excess of the Company's retention, as well as profit sharing and experience refund accruals.
24090_12_ITEM15_P84_S1	Reinsurance recoverable is reduced for estimated uncollectible amounts, if any.
24090_12_ITEM15_P85_S0	Reinsurance premiums, losses and adjustment expenses are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts.
24090_12_ITEM15_P85_S1	The cost of reinsurance related to long duration contracts is accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies.
24090_12_ITEM15_P85_S2	The cost of reinsurance related to short duration contracts is accounted for over the coverage period.
24090_12_ITEM15_P85_S3	Profit-sharing and similar adjustable provisions are accrued based on the experience of the underlying policies.
24090_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Company considers as cash equivalents all securities whose duration does not exceed 90 days at the date of acquisition.
24090_12_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Company considers investments maturing within one year at acquisition as short-term.
24090_12_ITEM15_P87_S1	These securities are carried at amortized cost, which approximates market value.
24090_12_ITEM15_P88_S0	Depreciation on most property and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis using estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years.
24090_12_ITEM15_P88_S1	Building improvements are depreciated over the estimated lives of thirty years.
24090_12_ITEM15_P89_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
24090_12_ITEM15_P89_S1	Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
24090_12_ITEM15_P90_S0	Reserving assumptions are reviewed to ensure our original assumptions at the time of policy issuance that related to interest, mortality, withdrawals, and settlement expenses are based upon management s best judgment.
24090_12_ITEM15_P91_S0	The Company revised assumptions used in the development of reserve and DAC balances to reflect the assumed decline in the long-term investment rate during the last quarter of 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P91_S1	The adjustment resulted in an increase to reserves of approximately $0.8 million and a decrease in the DAC asset of approximately $1.4 million.
24090_12_ITEM15_P92_S0	Certain amounts presented in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
24090_12_ITEM15_P93_S0	In October 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2010-26, which modifies the definition of the types of costs incurred by insurance entities that can be capitalized in the acquisition of new and renewal contracts.
24090_12_ITEM15_P93_S1	The guidance specifies that the costs must be based on successful efforts.
24090_12_ITEM15_P93_S2	The guidance also specifies that advertising costs should be included as deferred acquisition costs only when the direct-response advertising accounting criteria are met.
24090_12_ITEM15_P93_S3	If application of the guidance would result in the capitalization of acquisition costs that had not been capitalized prior to adoption, the entity may elect not to capitalize those additional costs.
24090_12_ITEM15_P93_S4	The new guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011, and should be applied prospectively, with retrospective application permitted.
24090_12_ITEM15_P93_S5	The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2012, with a retrospective application.
24090_12_ITEM15_P93_S6	The financial impact is currently estimated to result in a reduction in the DAC asset upon implementation between $10.0 million and $13.0 million as a retrospective adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings at the date of adoption, and an estimated increase in pre-tax earnings of $0.5 million to $1.0 million.
24090_12_ITEM15_P94_S0	In June 2011, the FASB amended ASU No. 2011-05 on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements to improve the comparability, consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items that are recorded in other comprehensive income.
24090_12_ITEM15_P94_S1	The new accounting guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either (1) a continuous statement of comprehensive income or (2) two separate but consecutive statements.
24090_12_ITEM15_P94_S2	The provisions of this new guidance are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P94_S3	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
24090_12_ITEM15_P95_S0	Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs amends Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , to converge the fair value measurement guidance in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
24090_12_ITEM15_P95_S1	ASU 2011-04 clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement requirements, changes certain principles in Topic 820 and requires additional fair value disclosures.
24090_12_ITEM15_P95_S2	ASU 2011-04 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.
24090_12_ITEM15_P96_S0	Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment ( ASU No. 2011-08 ).
24090_12_ITEM15_P96_S1	This standard amends existing guidance by giving an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
24090_12_ITEM15_P96_S2	This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P96_S3	The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
24090_12_ITEM15_P97_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued disclosure guidance for entities that enter into business combinations that are material.
24090_12_ITEM15_P97_S1	The guidance specifies that if an entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period.
24090_12_ITEM15_P97_S2	The guidance expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination.
24090_12_ITEM15_P97_S3	The Company will apply the guidance to any business combinations entered into on or after January 1, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P98_S0	The Company has assessed, based upon the information available, the Affordable Care Act, as passed by the U.S. Congress in the first quarter of 2010.
24090_12_ITEM15_P98_S1	The Company has considered its medical and dental plans provided for employees and agents.
24090_12_ITEM15_P98_S2	While the Company will incur additional costs associated with the implementation of this Act, it does not believe these costs or ongoing costs associated with this Act will have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.
24090_12_ITEM15_P99_S0	The Company does not provide a separate prescription drug plan to its retirees.
24090_12_ITEM15_P99_S1	In addition, the Company does not sell any medical insurance or prescription drug coverage.
24090_12_ITEM15_P99_S2	However, the Company does sell dental insurance but believes the impact of this Act is immaterial to these products.
24090_12_ITEM15_P99_S3	The Company will continue to assess the information contained in this Act as additional guidance becomes available and as additional implications are understood or clarified.
24090_12_ITEM15_P100_S0	In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( the Financial Reform Act ) was enacted.
24090_12_ITEM15_P100_S1	The Financial Reform act includes a provision to establish a Federal Insurance Office with the primary purpose of collecting information to better understand insurance issues at the federal level and to monitor the extent to which traditional underserved communities and consumers, minorities and low and moderate income persons have access to affordable insurance products.
24090_12_ITEM15_P100_S2	The Financial Reform Act also contains provisions affecting financial institutions, credit rating agencies and other commercial and consumer businesses.
24090_12_ITEM15_P101_S0	The Company invests primarily in fixed maturity securities, which totaled 85.0% of total investments and cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P101_S1	Holdings in high quality fixed maturity securities rated A or higher by Standard Poor's, Inc. totaled 84.8% of investment holdings in this category, reflecting the conservative investment philosophy of the Company.
24090_12_ITEM15_P102_S0	During 2011, we reinvested $31.5 million of fixed maturity bond proceeds from calls and prepayments into bond mutual funds.
24090_12_ITEM15_P102_S1	This change in investment strategy to diversify a small percentage of holdings into highly-rated bond funds to gain a shorter duration with an attractive yield is reflected in the increase of equity holdings to 5.3%.
24090_12_ITEM15_P103_S0	The cost, gross unrealized gains and losses and fair value of investments in fixed maturities and equity securities, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, are as follows.
24090_12_ITEM15_P104_S0	For investments of available-for-sale fixed maturities that have unrealized losses as of December 31, 2011, the cost, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer and fair value are as follows.
24090_12_ITEM15_P105_S0	As of December 31, 2011, there are no unrealized losses greater than 12 months on the Company's equity securities.
24090_12_ITEM15_P106_S0	The largest group of available-for-sale fixed maturities in a gross unrealized loss position for more than 12 months is primarily the municipal bonds acquired in the acquisition of SPLIC in 2004, and under purchase GAAP accounting, have a higher cost basis than historical cost.
24090_12_ITEM15_P106_S1	These premiums are being amortized to net investment income.
24090_12_ITEM15_P106_S2	Management has completed its assessment of other-than-temporary impairment of these securities.
24090_12_ITEM15_P106_S3	Based on our evaluation of the credit worthiness of the issuers and because we do not intend to sell the investments, nor is it likely that we would be required to sell these investments, before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, none of the unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporary.
24090_12_ITEM15_P107_S0	We monitor all debt and equity securities on an on-going basis relative to changes in credit ratings, market prices, earnings trends and financial performance, in addition to specific region or industry reviews.
24090_12_ITEM15_P107_S1	Our impairment review, in accordance with current guidance, is performed by the Company at each reporting date and management uses its best judgment to decide if impairment is other-than-temporary.
24090_12_ITEM15_P107_S2	We determine other-than-temporary impairment by reviewing relevant evidence related to the specific security issuer, as well as our intent to sell the security or whether we more likely than not will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery.
24090_12_ITEM15_P108_S0	All securities with a market price below 90% of par were segregated and reviewed as of December 31, 2011 based upon the items above for other-than-temporary impairment.
24090_12_ITEM15_P109_S0	For investments of available-for-sale fixed maturities and equity securities that have unrealized losses as of December 31, 2010, the cost, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer and fair value are as follows.
24090_12_ITEM15_P110_S0	The amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturities at December 31, 2011 by contractual maturity are shown below.
24090_12_ITEM15_P111_S0	Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
24090_12_ITEM15_P112_S0	The securities not due at a single maturity date include mortgage-backed obligations of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises and corporate securities.
24090_12_ITEM15_P113_S0	The Company had no investments in any one entity, excluding U.S. Government agencies, which exceeded 10% of stockholders' equity at December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P113_S1	In addition, there were no investments that were non-income producing for the year ended December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P114_S0	Major categories of net investment income are summarized as follows:
24090_12_ITEM15_P115_S0	Proceeds and gross realized gains and losses from sales of fixed maturities available-for-sale for 2011, 2010 and 2009 are summarized as follows:
24090_12_ITEM15_P116_S0	Certain securities were sold during 2010 from a tax planning perspective and due to statutory reporting considerations related to non-rated securities.
24090_12_ITEM15_P117_S0	In 2009, the Company sold available-for-sale bonds to capture realized gains and reinvest in higher yielding securities of the same quality based upon market changes.
24090_12_ITEM15_P117_S1	No securities were sold from the held-to-maturity portfolio in 2011, 2010 or 2009.
24090_12_ITEM15_P118_S0	Proceeds and gross realized gains and losses from sales of equity securities for 2011, 2010 and 2009 are summarized as follows:
24090_12_ITEM15_P119_S0	In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company sold holdings of equity mutual funds that were previously impaired in 2008, generating realized capital gains for financial reporting purposes of $1.3 million, $6.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively, but realized losses for tax purposes.
24090_12_ITEM15_P119_S1	The tax losses offset current year tax gains and were carried back to recover taxes paid on gains in prior years.
24090_12_ITEM15_P120_S0	Realized investment gains (losses) are as follows:
24090_12_ITEM15_P121_S0	We recorded an OTTI write-down in 2011 of $70,000 related to one American Airlines ( AMR ) debt security holding which had a maturity date in 2012.
24090_12_ITEM15_P121_S1	AMR declared bankruptcy in November of 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P121_S2	We also recorded an impairment in 2011 of $0.6 million related to an investment property that was acquired as part of the Ozark acquisition in 2008.
24090_12_ITEM15_P121_S3	A current appraisal reflected a declining value of this Arkansas office building from the fair value at acquisition.
24090_12_ITEM15_P122_S0	The Company had realized gains of $31,000 from calls of held-to-maturity fixed maturities in 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P123_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
24090_12_ITEM15_P123_S1	We hold fixed maturity and equity securities that are carried at fair value.
24090_12_ITEM15_P124_S0	Fair value measurements are generally based upon observable and unobservable inputs.
24090_12_ITEM15_P124_S1	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.
24090_12_ITEM15_P124_S2	We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
24090_12_ITEM15_P125_S0	All assets and liabilities carried at fair value are required to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
24090_12_ITEM15_P126_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
24090_12_ITEM15_P127_S0	Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose inputs or whose significant value drivers are observable.
24090_12_ITEM15_P128_S0	Level 3 - Instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable.
24090_12_ITEM15_P129_S0	Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as U.S. Treasury securities, publicly traded mutual fund investments and individual stocks.
24090_12_ITEM15_P130_S0	Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued by independent pricing services or broker quotes.
24090_12_ITEM15_P130_S1	These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various inputs, such as interest rates, credit spreads and foreign exchange rates for the underlying financial instruments.
24090_12_ITEM15_P130_S2	All significant inputs are observable, or derived from observable information in the marketplace or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
24090_12_ITEM15_P131_S0	Financial instruments in this category primarily include corporate fixed maturity securities, U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise securities, municipal securities and certain mortgage and asset-backed securities.
24090_12_ITEM15_P132_S0	Level 3 is comprised of financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on non-binding broker prices utilizing significant inputs not based on, or corroborated by, readily available market information.
24090_12_ITEM15_P132_S1	This category consists of two private placement mortgage-backed securities where we cannot corroborate the significant valuation inputs with market observable data.
24090_12_ITEM15_P133_S0	The following table sets forth our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the date indicated.
24090_12_ITEM15_P134_S0	At December 31, 2011, the fixed maturities, valued using a third-party pricing source, totaled $499.8 million for Level 2 assets and comprised 88.9% of total reported fair value.
24090_12_ITEM15_P134_S1	Fair values for Level 3 assets are based upon unadjusted broker quotes that are non-binding.
24090_12_ITEM15_P135_S0	The Level 1 and Level 2 valuations are reviewed and validated quarterly through random testing by comparisons to separate pricing models, other third party pricing services, and back tested to recent trades.
24090_12_ITEM15_P135_S1	In addition, we obtain information relative to the third party pricing models and review model parameters for reasonableness.
24090_12_ITEM15_P135_S2	For the period ended December 31, 2011, there were no material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine fair values, and no broker or third party prices were changed from the values received.
24090_12_ITEM15_P136_S0	Fair values of these securities are based upon quoted market price and are classified as Level 1 assets.
24090_12_ITEM15_P137_S0	The fair values for short-term investments are determined using a third-party pricing source.
24090_12_ITEM15_P137_S1	These assets are classified as Level 2.
24090_12_ITEM15_P138_S0	Fair value of our warrants are based upon industry standard models that consider various observable inputs and are classified as Level 2.
24090_12_ITEM15_P139_S0	The following table presents additional information about fixed maturity securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and for which we have utilized significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs to determine fair value:
24090_12_ITEM15_P140_S0	We review the fair value hierarchy classifications each reporting period.
24090_12_ITEM15_P141_S0	Changes in the observability of the valuation attributes may result in a reclassification of certain financial assets.
24090_12_ITEM15_P141_S1	Such reclassifications, if any, are reported as transfers in and out of Level 3 at the beginning fair value for the reporting period in which the changes occur.
24090_12_ITEM15_P142_S0	Estimates of fair values are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market prices and information about the financial instrument.
24090_12_ITEM15_P142_S1	The estimated fair values of financial instruments presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company might realize in actual market transactions.
24090_12_ITEM15_P142_S2	The carrying amount and fair value for the financial assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at each year-end were as follows:
24090_12_ITEM15_P143_S0	Fair values for fixed income securities are based on quoted market prices.
24090_12_ITEM15_P143_S1	In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other assumptions, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.
24090_12_ITEM15_P144_S0	Mortgage loans are secured principally by residential properties and commercial properties.
24090_12_ITEM15_P144_S1	Weighted average interest rates for these loans were approximately 6.6% and 6.7% per year, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, with maturities ranging from one to thirty years.
24090_12_ITEM15_P144_S2	Management estimated the fair value using an annual interest rate of 6.25% at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
24090_12_ITEM15_P145_S0	The fair value of the Company s liabilities under annuity contract policies were estimated using discounted cash flows at a risk free rate plus a component for non-performance risk and interest rate risk.
24090_12_ITEM15_P145_S1	The fair value of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in the overall management of interest rate risk, which seeks to minimize exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment maturities with amounts due under insurance contracts.
24090_12_ITEM15_P146_S0	Policy loans have a weighted average annual interest rate of 7.7% as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and have no specified maturity dates.
24090_12_ITEM15_P146_S1	The aggregate fair value of policy loans approximates the carrying value reflected on the consolidated balance sheet.
24090_12_ITEM15_P146_S2	These loans typically carry an interest rate that is tied to the crediting rate applied to the related policy and contract reserves.
24090_12_ITEM15_P147_S0	Policy loans are an integral part of the life insurance policies that we have in force and cannot be valued separately and are not marketable.
24090_12_ITEM15_P147_S1	Therefore, the fair value approximates the carrying value.
24090_12_ITEM15_P148_S0	For cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accrued investment income, reinsurance recoverable, other assets, federal income tax payable and receivable, dividend accumulations, commissions payable, amounts held on deposit, and other liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of such financial instruments.
24090_12_ITEM15_P149_S0	We recorded an impairment in 2011 of $0.6 million to an investment property that was acquired as part of the ONLIC acquisition in 2008.
24090_12_ITEM15_P149_S1	A current appraisal, based primarily on an income approach, reflected a declining value of this Arkansas office building from the fair value at acquisition.
24090_12_ITEM15_P150_S0	Various assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit reserves of life insurance include the following: a) valuation interest rates from 4% to 9% per year; b) mortality assumptions are from the 1955 to 1960, 1965 to 1970, 1975 to 1980 and 2001 Select and Ultimate mortality tables; and c) withdrawals are based primarily on actual historical termination rates.
24090_12_ITEM15_P151_S0	The following table presents information on changes in the liability for life, accident and health and property policy and contract claims for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
24090_12_ITEM15_P152_S0	The Company experienced favorable development related to SPLIC of $1.4 million in 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P152_S1	We have performed a review and have refined our incurred but not reported calculation.
24090_12_ITEM15_P152_S2	This method is anticipated to provide us with a more refined view of the claims development process.
24090_12_ITEM15_P153_S0	The favorable development in 2010 of $1,187,000 was primarily related to the release of higher claim reserves and longer claim lags indicated following Hurricane s Katrina and Rita and the relocation of insured lives.
24090_12_ITEM15_P153_S1	The claims related to these events have stabilized and the higher claim reserves are no longer deemed necessary.
24090_12_ITEM15_P154_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company reinsures portions of certain policies that we underwrite to limit disproportionate risks.
24090_12_ITEM15_P154_S1	During 2011 and 2010, we retained varying amounts of individual insurance up to a maximum retention of $100,000 on any life.
24090_12_ITEM15_P154_S2	The Company also reinsures 100% of our accidental death benefit rider coverage.
24090_12_ITEM15_P154_S3	Catastrophe reinsurance is in place for our property policies.
24090_12_ITEM15_P154_S4	In 2011 and 2010, this reinsurance provided $10,000,000 of coverage above a $500,000 deductible.
24090_12_ITEM15_P155_S0	Our health insurance policies are substantially all reinsured on a 100% coinsurance basis.
24090_12_ITEM15_P155_S1	We remain contingently liable to the extent that the reinsuring companies cannot meet their obligations under these reinsurance treaties.
24090_12_ITEM15_P156_S0	Our amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and reserves ceded to reinsurers.
24090_12_ITEM15_P156_S1	We obtain reinsurance from multiple reinsurers, and we monitor concentration as well as financial strength ratings of our principal reinsurers.
24090_12_ITEM15_P156_S2	The ratings by A.M. Best Company range from B+ (Good) to A+ (Superior).
24090_12_ITEM15_P157_S0	To protect our position, we have established and funded a trust to cover the contingent liabilities related to accident and health reinsurance ceded to Puritan Life Insurance Company of America, which represents $5.1 million of the $9.6 million of reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P158_S0	Assumed and ceded life reinsurance activity as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 is summarized as follows:
24090_12_ITEM15_P159_S0	The Company's reinsurance recoveries on ceded reinsurance were $9.6 million in 2011 and $9.7 million in 2010.
24090_12_ITEM15_P159_S1	Premiums and claims and surrenders assumed and ceded for all lines of business for these years are summarized as follows:
24090_12_ITEM15_P160_S0	SPFIC has catastrophe reinsurance that covers the first event in excess of a $500,000 deductible up to $10.0 million.
24090_12_ITEM15_P160_S1	In consideration for a reinstatement premium, second event coverage is provided in excess of a $500,000 deductible up to $10.0 million.
24090_12_ITEM15_P160_S2	The annual premium was approximately $1.1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009.
24090_12_ITEM15_P161_S0	The two classes of our common stock are equal in all respects, except (a) each Class A share receives twice the cash dividends paid on a per share basis to the Class B common stock; and (b) the Class B common stock elects a simple majority of the Board of Directors of Citizens and the Class A common stock elects the remaining directors.
24090_12_ITEM15_P162_S0	The table below shows the combined total of all of our insurance subsidiaries' capital and surplus and net income (loss) for life insurance operations and property insurance operations, although these amounts are not all available as dividends to Citizens, Inc., because only CICA is directly owned by Citizens, Inc.
24090_12_ITEM15_P162_S1	All other subsidiaries are owned by CICA.
24090_12_ITEM15_P163_S0	Generally, the net assets of the insurance subsidiaries available for transfer to their immediate parent are limited to the greater of the subsidiary net gain from operations during the preceding year or 10% of the subsidiary net statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_12_ITEM15_P163_S1	Under these practices, total surplus at December 31, 2011 was $54.8 million and net gain from operations was $2.4 million for CICA.
24090_12_ITEM15_P163_S2	Based upon statutory net gain from operations and surplus of CICA as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011, a dividend of approximately $5.5 million could be paid to the Company without prior regulatory approval in 2012.
24090_12_ITEM15_P163_S3	Payments of dividends in excess of such amounts would generally require approval by regulatory authorities.
24090_12_ITEM15_P164_S0	CICA, CNLIC, SPLIC and SPFIC have calculated their risk based capital ("RBC") in accordance with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' Model Rule and the RBC rules as adopted by their respective states of domicile.
24090_12_ITEM15_P164_S1	All insurance subsidiaries exceeded RBC minimum levels at December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P165_S0	In July 2004, the Company completed a private placement of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series A-1 Preferred ) to four unaffiliated institutional investors.
24090_12_ITEM15_P165_S1	We also issued to the investors warrants to purchase shares of our Class A common stock, at an exercise price of $6.95 per share, and unit warrants to purchase Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series A-2 Preferred ).
24090_12_ITEM15_P165_S2	The conversion, exercise and redemption prices, along with the number of shares and warrants, were adjusted for stock dividends paid on December 31, 2004 and on December 30, 2005.
24090_12_ITEM15_P166_S0	On July 13, 2009, the Company converted all of its outstanding Series A-1 and Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock into Class A common shares in accordance with the mandatory redemption provision of the preferred shareholder agreement dated July 12, 2004.
24090_12_ITEM15_P166_S1	The total amount of Class A common shares issued as part of the conversion was 1,706,682, inclusive of pro rata dividends due through the conversion date.
24090_12_ITEM15_P167_S0	On July 12, 2011, 255,216 warrant shares were exercised for cash totaling $1.8 million.
24090_12_ITEM15_P167_S1	The remaining shares of 767,254 that were due to expire on July 12, 2011 were exercised by a cashless provision that resulted in the issuance of 1,989 Class A shares by the Company to the warrant holders.
24090_12_ITEM15_P167_S2	Additionally, 9,487 shares were issued upon the exercise of warrants at various dates in 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P168_S0	There are outstanding warrants to purchase the Company's stock at prices ranging from $6.72 to $7.93, which were issued to investors of the Series A-2 Preferred.
24090_12_ITEM15_P168_S1	These warrants are outstanding until 2012, as shown below.
24090_12_ITEM15_P169_S0	The fair value of the warrants is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is classified as a liability on the balance sheet in the amount of $0.5 million and $1.6 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM15_P169_S1	The change in fair value of warrants is reported as a component of revenue in the income statement.
24090_12_ITEM15_P169_S2	The change in fair value of warrants for the year ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 caused an increase in revenues of $1.1 million, $0.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM15_P170_S0	We are a defendant in a lawsuit filed on August 6, 1999, in the Texas District Court, Austin, Texas, now styled Delia Bolanos Andrade, et al., Plaintiffs, v. Citizens Insurance Company of America, et al., Defendants in which a class was originally certified by the trial court and reversed by the Texas Supreme Court in 2007 with an order to the trial court to conduct further proceedings consistent with its ruling.
24090_12_ITEM15_P170_S1	The underlying lawsuit alleged that certain life insurance policies CICA made available to non-U.S. residents, when combined with a policy feature that allowed certain cash benefits to be assigned to two non-U.S. trusts for the purpose of accumulating ownership of our Class A common stock, along with allowing the policyholders to make additional contributions to the trusts, were actually offers and sales of securities that occurred in Texas by unregistered dealers in violation of the Texas securities laws.
24090_12_ITEM15_P170_S2	The remedy sought was rescission and return of the insurance premium payments.
24090_12_ITEM15_P170_S3	On December 9, 2009, the trial court denied the recertification of the class after conducting additional proceedings in accordance with the Texas Supreme Court's ruling.
24090_12_ITEM15_P170_S4	The remaining plaintiffs must now proceed individually, and not as a class, if they intend to pursue their claims against us.
24090_12_ITEM15_P170_S5	Since the December 9, 2009 trial court ruling, no individual cases have been further pursued by the plaintiffs.
24090_12_ITEM15_P170_S6	The probability of the plaintiffs further pursuing their cases individually is unknown.
24090_12_ITEM15_P170_S7	An estimate of any possible loss or range of losses cannot be made at this time in regard to individuals pursuing claims.
24090_12_ITEM15_P170_S8	However, should the plaintiffs further pursue their claims individually, we intend to vigorously defend any proceedings.
24090_12_ITEM15_P171_S0	SPFIC is a defendant in a putative class action lawsuit in Louisiana styled The State of Louisiana v. AAA Insurance (the "Road Home Litigation"), which was filed in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans on August 23, 2007.
24090_12_ITEM15_P171_S1	The Louisiana Attorney General filed the Road Home Litigation as a putative class action lawsuit in state court against SPFIC and approximately 200 other insurers on behalf of the State of Louisiana, as assignee, and on behalf of a class of Road Home fund recipients alleging that SPFIC and the other insurers have failed to pay all damages owed under their policies.
24090_12_ITEM15_P171_S2	The insurers removed the matter to federal court.
24090_12_ITEM15_P171_S3	The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, and in March 2009, the district court granted part of the defendants motion, dismissing all of the extra-contractual claims, including the bad faith and breach of fiduciary duty claims.
24090_12_ITEM15_P171_S4	As a result, the remaining claims are for breach of contract and declaratory relief on the alleged underpayment of claims by the insurers.
24090_12_ITEM15_P171_S5	The court did not dismiss the class action allegations.
24090_12_ITEM15_P171_S6	The defendants also had moved to dismiss the complaint on grounds that the State had no standing to bring the lawsuit as an assignee of insureds because of anti-assignment language in the insurers policies.
24090_12_ITEM15_P171_S7	The court denied the defendants motion for reconsideration on the assignment issue but found the matter was ripe for consideration by the federal appellate court.
24090_12_ITEM15_P172_S0	The defendants filed a petition for permission to appeal to the Fifth Circuit.
24090_12_ITEM15_P172_S1	On July 20, 2011, the Fifth Circuit ruled there was no public policy which precludes an anti-assignment clause from applying to post loss assignments, but the anti-assignment language must be evaluated on a policy by policy basis and unambiguously express that the non-assignment clause applies to post-loss assignments.
24090_12_ITEM15_P172_S2	In October 2011, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana denied the State s motion to remand to state court.
24090_12_ITEM15_P172_S3	The Road Home Litigation remains pending in federal district court.
24090_12_ITEM15_P172_S4	The State has yet to identify the specific claims it contends are at issue in the Road Home Litigation, or the alleged deficiencies in adjusting those claims.
24090_12_ITEM15_P172_S5	Each individual claim at issue will require an individual analysis.
24090_12_ITEM15_P172_S6	A number of the claims may be subject to individual defenses.
24090_12_ITEM15_P172_S7	To date, there has been no discovery in the Road Home Litigation.
24090_12_ITEM15_P172_S8	We anticipate the State will vigorously pursue the matter in the district court and are uncertain as to the impact a case by case analysis of claims will have on SPFIC.
24090_12_ITEM15_P172_S9	An estimate of possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time as a result of the Fifth Circuit or federal district court's rulings in the Road Home Litigation.
24090_12_ITEM15_P172_S10	SPFIC intends to vigorously defend any remaining proceedings.
24090_12_ITEM15_P173_S0	SPFIC is vigorously defending a number of matters in various stages of development filed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in addition to the Road Home Litigation, including a number of individual lawsuits, which are immaterial to the Company s financial statements.
24090_12_ITEM15_P174_S0	At this time we cannot estimate any possible loss or range of losses in regard to either Delia Bolanos Andrade, et al., Plaintiffs, v. Citizens Insurance Company of America, et al., Defendants or the Road Home Litigation.
24090_12_ITEM15_P175_S0	We are defending these claims vigorously.
24090_12_ITEM15_P175_S1	However, in doing so, we continue to incur significant defense costs, including attorneys' fees, other direct litigation costs and the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_12_ITEM15_P175_S2	If we suffer an adverse judgment as a result of either of these claims, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_12_ITEM15_P176_S0	We have the following lease commitments as of December 31, 2011 with the payments due by the periods indicated below.
24090_12_ITEM15_P177_S0	Operating lease expense was $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 and $0.4 million for 2009.
24090_12_ITEM15_P178_S0	The Company has three reportable segments: Life Insurance, Home Service Insurance, and Other Non-Insurance Enterprises.
24090_12_ITEM15_P178_S1	The accounting policies of the segments are in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are the same as those described in the summary of significant account policies.
24090_12_ITEM15_P179_S0	We evaluate profit and loss performance based on U.S. GAAP net income before federal income taxes for our three reportable segments.
24090_12_ITEM15_P180_S0	The Company has no reportable differences between segments and consolidated operations.
24090_12_ITEM15_P181_S0	The table below summarizes assets by segment.
24090_12_ITEM15_P182_S0	Major categories of earned premiums are summarized as follows:
24090_12_ITEM15_P183_S0	The following table sets forth the Company's annual total of earned premiums from geographic area for the years indicated:
24090_12_ITEM15_P184_S0	Our federal income tax expense was $2.8 million, $4.1 million and $3.3 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM15_P184_S1	This represents effective tax rates of 25.0%, 21.0% and 15.8%, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM15_P185_S0	In 2008, a valuation allowance of $6.9 million was established for the OTTI recorded in 2008 related to the Company's stock mutual funds.
24090_12_ITEM15_P185_S1	Additionally, a valuation allowance of $804,000 was established for securities acquired in the ONLIC acquisition.
24090_12_ITEM15_P185_S2	In 2009, $2.8 million of the valuation allowance established in 2008 for the OTTI on mutual funds was released as a reduction in tax expense.
24090_12_ITEM15_P185_S3	This release related to the mutual funds that were sold in 2009 and generated realized capital gains.
24090_12_ITEM15_P185_S4	Additionally, $2.7 million of the valuation allowance established in 2008 was released as an increase to other comprehensive income ("OCI").
24090_12_ITEM15_P185_S5	This release was related to the increase in the fair value during 2009 of the mutual funds still owned at December 31, 2009.
24090_12_ITEM15_P185_S6	An additional valuation allowance was set up for $254,000 related to additional declines in ONLIC investments.
24090_12_ITEM15_P185_S7	This amount was added to goodwill.
24090_12_ITEM15_P186_S0	During 2010, most of the mutual funds owned at December 31, 2009 were sold.
24090_12_ITEM15_P186_S1	Primarily due to this event, a tax valuation allowance was no longer required at December 31, 2010 and the $2.5 million allowance was released as a reduction in tax expense.
24090_12_ITEM15_P186_S2	Additionally, $1.9 million of the valuation allowance in OCI was released as a reduction in income tax expense, since the mutual funds that the allowance related to had been sold.
24090_12_ITEM15_P186_S3	The total tax expense reduction from the release of the valuation allowance in 2010 was $4.3 million.
24090_12_ITEM15_P186_S4	In 2011, $570,000 of the valuation allowance still remaining in OCI was released as a reduction in tax expense as the stocks the valuation allowance related to were either sold or called.
24090_12_ITEM15_P187_S0	The table below summarizes the changes in the valuation allowance.
24090_12_ITEM15_P188_S0	A reconciliation of federal income tax expense computed by applying the federal income tax rate of 35% in 2011, 2010 and 2009 to income (loss) before federal income tax expense is as follows:
24090_12_ITEM15_P189_S0	Income tax expense (benefit) consists of:
24090_12_ITEM15_P190_S0	Deferred tax expense is comprised of $1,264,000 deferred tax benefit and $570,000 tax benefit released from OCI .
24090_12_ITEM15_P191_S0	The components of deferred federal income taxes are as follows:
24090_12_ITEM15_P192_S0	A summary of the changes in the components of deferred federal and state income taxes is as follows:
24090_12_ITEM15_P193_S0	The Company and our subsidiaries had net operating losses at December 31, 2011 available to offset future taxable income of approximately $10.2 million, expiring at various times through 2029.
24090_12_ITEM15_P193_S1	A portion of the net operating loss carryforward is subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
24090_12_ITEM15_P194_S0	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we determined that as a result of our historical income, projected future income, tax planning strategies, and the nature of the items from which the deferred tax assets are derived, other than assets for which OTTI was recorded, it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized.
24090_12_ITEM15_P195_S0	The Company and our subsidiaries had capital loss carry-forwards at December 31, 2011 of $494,000, which expire, if not used, in 2016.
24090_12_ITEM15_P195_S1	The Company intends to generate capital gains before the losses expire.
24090_12_ITEM15_P196_S0	This is a special memorandum tax account into which certain amounts not previously taxed, under prior tax laws, were accumulated.
24090_12_ITEM15_P196_S1	No new additions are expected to be made to this account.
24090_12_ITEM15_P196_S2	Federal income taxes will become payable thereon at the then current tax rate (a) when and if distributions to shareholders, other than stock dividends and other limited exceptions, are made in excess of the accumulated previously taxed income; or (b) when a company ceases to be a life insurance company as defined by the Internal Revenue Code and such termination is not due to another life insurance company acquiring its assets in a nontaxable transaction.
24090_12_ITEM15_P197_S0	We do not anticipate any transactions that would cause any part of this amount to become taxable.
24090_12_ITEM15_P197_S1	However, should the balance at December 31, 2011 become taxable, the tax computed at present rates would be approximately $1,152,000.
24090_12_ITEM15_P198_S0	There are no uncertain tax positions for the year ended December 31, 2011; therefore, we did not accrue any interest or penalties related to these items.
24090_12_ITEM15_P199_S0	The Company's Federal income tax return is filed on a consolidated basis with the following entities:
24090_12_ITEM15_P200_S0	Security Plan Life Insurance Company and Security Plan Fire Insurance Company were included in the consolidated return for the first time in 2010.
24090_12_ITEM15_P201_S0	The method of allocation among companies is subject to a written tax sharing agreement, approved by the Board of Directors, whereby allocation is made primarily on a separate return basis with current credit for any net operating losses or other items utilized in the consolidated tax return.
24090_12_ITEM15_P202_S0	Intercompany tax balances are settled quarterly.
24090_12_ITEM15_P203_S0	The Company and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various U.S. states.
24090_12_ITEM15_P203_S1	Most of our subsidiaries are not subject to examination by U.S. tax authorities for years prior to 2008.
24090_12_ITEM15_P203_S2	Some of our subsidiaries have open tax years going back as far as 1995 due to net operating loss carry-forwards.
24090_12_ITEM15_P204_S0	The changes in the components of other comprehensive income (loss) are reported net of the effects of income taxes of 35% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, as indicated below.
24090_12_ITEM15_P205_S0	The Company sponsors a defined contribution profit-sharing plan.
24090_12_ITEM15_P205_S1	Employees with one year of service can participate.
24090_12_ITEM15_P205_S2	Contributions are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and are subject to a tiered vesting schedule.
24090_12_ITEM15_P205_S3	Employer contributions to the plan were $1.0 million in 2011 and 2010 and $0.7 million in 2009.
24090_12_ITEM15_P205_S4	The plan does not permit employee contributions.
24090_12_ITEM15_P206_S0	The Company is primarily self-insured for employee health benefits.
24090_12_ITEM15_P206_S1	The Company records its self-insurance liability based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.
24090_12_ITEM15_P206_S2	There is stop-loss coverage for amounts in excess of $100,000 per individual per year.
24090_12_ITEM15_P206_S3	If more claims are made than were estimated or if the costs of actual claims increase beyond what was anticipated, reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional accruals may be required in future periods.
24090_12_ITEM15_P207_S0	The Company sponsors the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan (the "Plan"), which is administered by an independent third party.
24090_12_ITEM15_P207_S1	The Plan is a means for new and existing investors in our Class A Common Stock to purchase and sell shares at market prices.
24090_12_ITEM15_P207_S2	Each share purchased through the Plan is registered in the name of the investing shareholder.
24090_12_ITEM15_P207_S3	The Company offers the Plan to our policyholders for automatic investment of policy benefits, including policyholder dividends.
24090_12_ITEM15_P207_S4	We do not have possession of, or control over, any amounts invested through the Plan.
24090_12_ITEM15_P208_S0	Citizens, Inc. purchased Class A common shares during 2011 and 2010 that were held by subsidiaries at market value as of the transaction dates, which approximated $1.2 million and $4.3 million, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM15_P208_S1	These transactions were eliminated for financial reporting purposes in accordance with consolidation accounting, but generated a tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 totaling approximately $0.4 million and $1.4 million.
24090_12_ITEM15_P209_S0	The Company previously filed a plan of merger with the Departments of Insurance of Colorado and Indiana related to the planned merger of Integrity Capital Corporation and the merger of the down-line subsidiary Integrity Capital Insurance Company into CICA.
24090_12_ITEM15_P209_S1	The Company received approval from the respective state insurance departments to merge Integrity Capital Insurance Company into CICA as of April 1, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P209_S2	Prior to the mergers, Citizens contributed the stock of ICC to CICA.
24090_12_ITEM15_P209_S3	The capital contribution did not impact the overall consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.
24090_12_ITEM15_P209_S4	However, the Company does anticipate the elimination of duplicative overhead and annual regulatory reporting expenses.
24090_12_ITEM15_P209_S5	Integrity Capital Corporation and Integrity Capital Insurance Company were merged into CICA as of April 1, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P210_S0	In 2011 and 2010, CICA paid a dividend of $6.8 million and $9.3 million, respectively, to Citizens, Inc. and SPLIC paid a dividend to CICA in the amount of $0.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM15_P210_S1	In 2009, CICA declared a dividend to Citizens, Inc. of $10.5 million that was paid in January 2010 and SPLIC paid a dividend to CICA of $1.4 million.
24090_12_ITEM15_P211_S0	The following table contains selected unaudited financial data for each quarter.
24090_12_ITEM15_P212_S0	We have evaluated for subsequent events as defined by the accounting guidance through the date of financial statement issuance.
24090_12_ITEM15_P212_S1	No items were identified in this period subsequent to the financial statement date that required adjustment or disclosure.

24090_12_ITEM15_P244_S0	Investor conference call scheduled for Tuesday, March 13, at 10 a.m.
24090_12_ITEM15_P245_S0	AUSTIN, TEXAS (March 12, 2012) Citizens, Inc. (NYSE: CIA) reported results today for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P246_S0	Rick D. Riley, Vice Chairman and President, said, Our 2011 results are strong considering the economic environment in which all insurance companies have been operating.
24090_12_ITEM15_P246_S1	For the year, our consolidated life insurance premiums increased 6%, driven largely by strong persistency and continued expansion in our international business, where endowment products continue to grow in popularity.
24090_12_ITEM15_P247_S0	Riley added, Due to the healthy premium growth, we were able to increase invested assets by 15.6% to $839 million from $726 million at year-end 2010.
24090_12_ITEM15_P247_S1	As a result, we reported investment income growth for the fourth quarter and full year as the higher balances offset the lower yields available in this market.
24090_12_ITEM15_P247_S2	With our conservative investment philosophy, our portfolio is currently yielding just over 4% compared with 4.3% in 2010.
24090_12_ITEM15_P248_S0	Further, book value per share of Class A common stock increased 11.8% to $5.12 at December 31, 2011, compared with $4.58 at year-end 2010.
24090_12_ITEM15_P248_S1	The 2011 year-end book value was up $0.02 from September 30, 2011, due to fluctuations in the market values of bonds in our portfolio, Riley said.
24090_12_ITEM15_P249_S0	Riley commented, Net realized gains on investments were significantly lower than the prior year.
24090_12_ITEM15_P249_S1	Although we sold previously impaired mutual fund holdings in both years, in 2010 we had additional realized gains on the sale of below investment-grade securities.
24090_12_ITEM15_P249_S2	The sale of those securities allowed us to recover taxes paid on prior year gains and to accomplish consolidated return tax savings.
24090_12_ITEM15_P250_S0	Despite the substantial reduction in the number of outstanding warrants during 2011, the fair value change of warrants outstanding had a positive effect on results for both 2011 and 2010.
24090_12_ITEM15_P250_S1	We expect the 169,482 remaining warrants will either be exercised or expire in 2012.
24090_12_ITEM15_P251_S0	Turning to operating income, Riley noted, By design, our endowment and whole life products should generate equivalent profitability over the long term.
24090_12_ITEM15_P251_S1	In the near term, however, the strong growth of endowment product sales makes year-over-year comparisons difficult.
24090_12_ITEM15_P252_S0	The endowment products require initial accumulation of higher reserve balances.
24090_12_ITEM15_P252_S1	Whole life products, which accumulate initial reserves at a slower pace, were a smaller percentage of new business in 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P253_S0	Non-GAAP Financial Measures - The table above reconciles Net Income to Operating Income.
24090_12_ITEM15_P253_S1	Operating Income is a "Non-GAAP" financial measure that is widely used in our industry to evaluate the performance of underwriting operations.
24090_12_ITEM15_P253_S2	Operating Income excludes the Fair Value Changes of Warrants and the after-tax net effects of Net Realized Investment Gains and Losses.
24090_12_ITEM15_P253_S3	We believe it presents a useful view of the performance of our insurance operations.
24090_12_ITEM15_P253_S4	While we believe disclosure of certain Non-GAAP information is appropriate, you should not consider this information without also considering the information we present in accordance with GAAP.
24090_12_ITEM15_P254_S0	Riley added, In addition, the prolonged low interest rate environment is affecting our reserve development assumptions.
24090_12_ITEM15_P254_S1	Because of assumption changes for policies issued in 2011, fourth quarter results reflect an approximately $0.8 million increase in policy reserves and $1.4 million increase in amortization of deferred acquisition costs.
24090_12_ITEM15_P254_S2	Final assumptions used for the fourth quarter and the full year reflect the lower investment yield that resulted in 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P255_S0	Life Insurance - Our Life Insurance segment primarily issues ordinary whole life insurance in U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents in approximately 30 countries through approximately 2,300 independent marketing consultants, and domestically through almost 300 independent marketing firms and consultants throughout the United States.
24090_12_ITEM15_P256_S0	Premiums Life insurance premium revenues increased for the fourth quarter and full year of 2011, due to higher international renewal premiums, which have experienced strong persistency as this block of business ages.
24090_12_ITEM15_P256_S1	First year premiums also increased in the current year, reflecting improved new business performance.
24090_12_ITEM15_P256_S2	Sales from Colombia, Ecuador, Taiwan, and Venezuela represented the majority of the first year premium increase.
24090_12_ITEM15_P257_S0	In addition, most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision, which allows the policyholder to utilize cash value of a policy to pay premiums and keep policies in force.
24090_12_ITEM15_P257_S1	The policy loan asset balance in the life insurance segment increased 10.5% year over year.
24090_12_ITEM15_P258_S0	Benefits and expenses Life insurance benefits and expenses increased more rapidly than premiums for the fourth quarter and full year of 2011 primarily because endowment products require accumulation of higher reserve balances on the front end when compared to whole life products.
24090_12_ITEM15_P258_S1	In addition, general expenses increased in 2011 as part of allocations based upon routine time studies, resulting in approximately $1.5 million higher current year expenses versus the prior year.
24090_12_ITEM15_P258_S2	Amortization of deferred acquisition costs decreased by 2.9% as improved persistency lowered amortization but it was largely offset by $1 million of increased amortization expense related to the assumption changes for lower long-term portfolio yield on new issued business.
24090_12_ITEM15_P259_S0	Home Service - Our Home Service Insurance segment provides pre-need and final expense ordinary life insurance and annuities to middle and lower income individuals primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_12_ITEM15_P259_S1	Our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through funeral homes and a home service marketing distribution system utilizing approximately 530 employees and independent agents.
24090_12_ITEM15_P260_S0	Premiums Home service premiums increased 2.7% from the 2010 results, inclusive of a rate increase of approximately 5.8% for Security Plan Fire Insurance Company that became effective January 1, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P261_S0	Benefits and expenses Home service benefits and expenses increased by 10.4% for the fourth quarter, but were essentially unchanged for the full year of 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P261_S1	Claims and surrenders were down 2.3% from 2010 reported amounts, which had a positive impact on results, as did the lower allocation for general expenses.
24090_12_ITEM15_P261_S2	Current year results were negatively impacted by an increase in amortization of deferred acquisition expenses resulting from the assumption changes for new issued business relating to the anticipated lower long-term portfolio yield and a high lapse rate experienced in 2011 compared to 2010.
24090_12_ITEM15_P262_S0	Invested assets Total invested assets grew 15.6% in 2011, reflecting additional premium income from new and renewal business over the past year.
24090_12_ITEM15_P263_S0	Equity security holdings increased to $46.1 million at year-end 2011 from $23.3 million at year-end 2010 as bond proceeds of approximately $31.5 million were reinvested into bond mutual funds to gain additional yield via shorter duration opportunities.
24090_12_ITEM15_P264_S0	Cash and cash equivalents represented 3.8% of total cash, cash equivalents and invested assets at year-end 2011, down from 6.4% in 2010, reflecting the timing of calls and reinvestment.
24090_12_ITEM15_P265_S0	Investment income Net investment income increased 29.9% for the quarter ended December 31, 2011, and 2.9% for the full-year.
24090_12_ITEM15_P265_S1	The gains were primarily due to higher average investment balances that offset the lower yields on invested assets.
24090_12_ITEM15_P265_S2	The policy loan asset balance increased by 9.8% in 2011, resulting in an increase in policy loan income, a component of investment income.
24090_12_ITEM15_P266_S0	Duration - Significant calls by issuers of fixed maturity securities have led to the reinvestment of proceeds at lower yields as market rates have declined.
24090_12_ITEM15_P267_S0	During 2011, the Company continued significant investment in bonds of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises.
24090_12_ITEM15_P267_S1	Additionally, the Company made investments in investment-grade corporate, municipal bonds and shorter duration bond mutual funds to obtain higher yields.
24090_12_ITEM15_P267_S2	The average maturity of the fixed income bond portfolio was 13.6 years with an estimated effective maturity of 5.7 years as of December 31, 2011.
24090_12_ITEM15_P268_S0	In 2011 and 2010, the Company sold equity mutual funds, which were previously impaired, and other securities for realized gains of $1.3 million and $6.4 million for tax considerations, respectively.
24090_12_ITEM15_P268_S1	In addition, we realized net gains of $1.3 million in 2010 on sales of securities from an acquired entity that were primarily below investment grade quality.
24090_12_ITEM15_P269_S0	On Tuesday, March 13, Citizens will host a conference call to discuss operating results at 10 a.m.
24090_12_ITEM15_P269_S1	The conference call will be hosted by Rick D. Riley, Vice Chairman and President, Kay Osbourn, Chief Financial Officer, and other members of the Company s management team.

24090_12_ITEM15_P270_S0	Citizens, Inc. is a financial services company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CIA.
24090_12_ITEM15_P270_S1	The Company utilizes a three-pronged strategy for growth based upon worldwide sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated whole life cash value insurance policies, life insurance product sales in the U.S. and the acquisition of other U.S. based life insurance companies.

24090_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	Citizens, Inc. ( Citizens ) is an insurance holding company serving the life insurance needs of individuals in the United States since 1969 and internationally since 1975.
24090_13_ITEM1_P0_S1	Through our insurance subsidiaries, we pursue a strategy of offering traditional insurance products in niche markets where we believe we are able to achieve competitive advantages.
24090_13_ITEM1_P0_S2	We had approximately $1.2 billion of assets at December 31, 2012 and approximately $5.0 billion of insurance in force.
24090_13_ITEM1_P0_S3	Our core insurance operations include issuing and servicing:
24090_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	final expense and limited liability property policies to middle and lower income households in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas through employee and independent agents in our home service distribution channel.
24090_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	We were formed in 1969 by our Chairman, Harold E. Riley.
24090_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	Prior to our formation, Mr. Riley had many years of experience in the international and domestic life insurance business.
24090_13_ITEM1_P2_S2	Our Company has experienced growth through acquisitions in the domestic market and through market expansion in the international market.
24090_13_ITEM1_P2_S3	We seek to capitalize on the experience of our management team in marketing and operations as we strive to generate bottom line return using knowledge of our niche markets and our well-established distribution channels.
24090_13_ITEM1_P2_S4	We believe our underwriting processes, policy terms, pricing practices and proprietary administrative systems enable us to be competitive in our current markets, while protecting our shareholders and serving our policyholders.
24090_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our business has grown, both internationally and domestically, in recent years.
24090_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	Revenues rose from $145.8 million in 2008 to $202.8 million in 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM1_P3_S2	During the five years ended December 31, 2012 , our assets grew from $822.3 million to $1.2 billion .
24090_13_ITEM1_P3_S3	Total stockholders' equity increased from $172.7 million at December 31, 2008 to $263.1 million at December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	"Selected Financial Data" in this Report.
24090_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	The following pages describe the operations of our three business segments: Life Insurance, Home Service and Other Non-Insurance Enterprises.
24090_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	Revenues derived from any single customer did not exceed 10% of consolidated revenues in any of the last three years.
24090_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our Life Insurance segment issues ordinary whole life insurance domestically and in U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents.
24090_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	These contracts are designed to provide a fixed amount of insurance coverage over the life of the insured.
24090_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	Additionally, endowment contracts are issued by the Company, which are principally accumulation contracts that incorporate an element of life insurance protection.
24090_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	For the majority of our business, we retain only the first $100,000 of risk on any one life.
24090_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	We operate this segment through our subsidiaries: CICA Life Insurance Company of America ("CICA") and Citizens National Life Insurance Company ("CNLIC").
24090_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	We focus our sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies to high net worth, high income residents in Latin America and the Pacific Rim.
24090_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	We have successfully participated in the foreign marketplace since 1975, and we continue to seek opportunities for expansion of our foreign operations.
24090_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	We believe positive attributes of our international insurance business include:
24090_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	persistency experience and mortality rates that are comparable to our U.S. policies.
24090_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	We have implemented several policies and procedures to reduce the risks of asset and premium loss relating to our international business.
24090_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	Approvals for policy issuance are made in our Austin, Texas office and policies are issued and delivered to our independent consultants, who deliver the policies to the insureds.
24090_13_ITEM1_P10_S2	We have no offices, employees or assets outside of the United States.
24090_13_ITEM1_P10_S3	Insurance policy applications and premium payments are submitted by the independent consultants or customers to us and we review the applications in our home offices in Austin, Texas.
24090_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	Premiums are paid in U.S. Dollars through a U.S. financial institution by check, wire or credit card.
24090_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	The policies we issue contain limitations on benefits for certain causes of death, such as homicide and careless driving.
24090_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	We have also developed disciplined underwriting criteria, which include medical reviews of applicants as well as background and reference checks.
24090_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	In addition, we have a claims policy that requires investigation of substantially all death claims.
24090_13_ITEM1_P12_S3	Furthermore, we perform background reviews and reference checks of prospective marketing firms and consultants.
24090_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	Independent marketing firms and consultants specialize in marketing life insurance products and generally have several years of insurance marketing experience.
24090_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	We maintain standard contracts with the independent marketing firms pursuant to which they provide recruitment, training and supervision of their managers and associates in the service and placement of our products; however, all associates of these firms also contract directly with us as independent contractors and receive their compensation directly from us.
24090_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	Accordingly, should an arrangement between any independent marketing firm and us be terminated for any reason, we believe we would continue with the existing marketing arrangements with the associates of these firms without a material loss of sales.
24090_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our standard agreement with independent marketing firms and consultants provides they are independent contractors responsible for their own operation expenses, and that they are the representative of the prospective insured.
24090_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	In addition, the marketing firms guarantee any debts of their associates to us.
24090_13_ITEM1_P14_S2	The marketing firms receive commissions on all new and renewal policies serviced or placed by them or their associates.
24090_13_ITEM1_P14_S3	All of these contracts provide that the independent marketing firms and consultants are aware of and responsible for compliance with local laws.
24090_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	We offer several ordinary whole life insurance and endowment products designed to meet the needs of our non-U.S. policyowners.
24090_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	These policies have been structured to provide:
24090_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	lifetime income guarantees for an insured or for surviving beneficiaries.
24090_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our international products have living benefit features.
24090_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	Every policy contains guaranteed cash values and is participating (i.e., provides for cash dividends as apportioned by the board of directors).
24090_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	Once a policyowner pays the annual premium and the policy is issued, we immediately pay the owner a cash dividend as well as an annual guaranteed endowment, if elected.
24090_13_ITEM1_P17_S3	The policyowner has several options with regard to the dividend and annual guaranteed endowments, including the right to assign policy values to the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan, registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), and administered in the United States by our unaffiliated transfer agent.
24090_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	The life insurance business is highly competitive.
24090_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	We compete with a large number of stock and mutual life companies internationally and domestically, as well as with financial institutions that offer insurance products.
24090_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	There are more than 1,000 life insurance companies in the United States, some of which also provide insurance to foreign residents.
24090_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	We face competition primarily from companies formed and operated in the country in which the insureds reside, from companies that operate in the same manner as we do and from companies that are foreign to the countries in which policies are sold, but issue insurance policies denominated in the local currency of those countries.
24090_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	A substantial number of companies may be deemed to have a competitive advantage over us due to their significantly greater financial resources, histories of successful operations and larger marketing forces.
24090_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	However, we believe that our experience, combined with our product portfolio features, allows us to compete effectively in pursuing new business.
24090_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Because premiums on our international policies are paid in U.S. Dollars drawn on U.S. financial institutions, and we pay claims and benefits in U.S. Dollars, we provide a product that is different from the products offered by foreign-domiciled companies.
24090_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	Our international policies are usually acquired by individuals with significant net worth and earnings that place them in the top income brackets of their respective countries.
24090_13_ITEM1_P22_S2	The policies sold by our foreign competitors are generally offered broadly and are priced using the mortality of the entire population of the geographic region.
24090_13_ITEM1_P22_S3	Our mortality charges are therefore typically lower, which provides a competitive advantage.
24090_13_ITEM1_P22_S4	Additionally, the assets backing the reserves for our foreign competitors' policies must be substantially invested in their respective countries and, therefore, are exposed to the inflationary risks and social or economic crises that have been more common in these foreign countries.
24090_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	The majority of our inforce business results from blocks of business of insurance companies we have acquired over the past 15 years.
24090_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our acquisition transition strategy focuses on the introduction of our cash accumulation ordinary whole life products to independent marketing consultants associated with companies we have acquired, while continuing to service the needs of acquired policyholders.
24090_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	In the Midwest and the southern United States, we seek to serve middle income households through the sale of cash accumulation ordinary whole life insurance products.
24090_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	Our distribution strategy is through marketing consultants, comprised primarily of part-time, second-career sales associates (such as teachers, coaches, community leaders and others) in rural and urban areas.
24090_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	Over the past few years, new product sales have remained flat while existing policies have been running off at a greater pace resulting in compressing the block of insurance in force.
24090_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our domestic life insurance products focus primarily on living needs and provide benefits focused toward accumulating money for the policyowner.
24090_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	The features of our domestic life insurance products include:
24090_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	an option to waive premium payments in the event of disability.
24090_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our life insurance products are principally designed to address the insured's concern about outliving his or her monthly income, while at the same time providing death benefits.
24090_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	The primary purpose of our product portfolio is to help the insured create capital for needs such as retirement income, children's higher education funds, business opportunities, emergencies and health care needs.
24090_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	The U.S. life insurance industry is a mature industry that, in recent years, has experienced little to no growth.
24090_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	Competition is intense because the life insurance industry is consolidating, with larger, more efficient and more effective organizations emerging from consolidation.
24090_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	Many domestic life insurance companies have significantly greater financial, marketing forces and other resources, longer business histories and more diversified lines of insurance products than we do.
24090_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	We also face competition from companies marketing in person as well as with direct mail and Internet sales campaigns.
24090_13_ITEM1_P30_S2	Although we may be at a competitive disadvantage to these entities, we believe our premium rates and policy features are generally competitive with those of other life insurance companies selling similar types of ordinary whole life insurance.
24090_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our Home Service segment operates in this market through our subsidiaries Security Plan Life Insurance Company ("SPLIC") and Security Plan Fire Insurance Company ("SPFIC"), and focus on the life insurance needs of the middle and lower income markets, primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	independent agents to sell policies, collect premiums and service policyholders.
24090_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	To a lesser extent, our Home Service segment sells limited-liability, named peril property policies covering dwelling and contents.
24090_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our home service insurance products consist primarily of small face amount ordinary whole life and pre-need policies, which are designed to fund final expenses for the insured, primarily consisting of funeral and burial costs.
24090_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	The average life insurance policy face amount issued was approximately $6,600 in 2012 ; therefore, the underwriting performed on these applications is limited.
24090_13_ITEM1_P33_S2	Our property coverages are limited to $30,000 maximum coverage on any one dwelling and contents, while content-only coverage and dwelling-only coverage is limited to $20,000 .
24090_13_ITEM1_P33_S3	We face competition in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas from other companies specializing in home service distribution of insurance.
24090_13_ITEM1_P33_S4	We seek to compete based upon our emphasis on personal service to our customers.
24090_13_ITEM1_P33_S5	We intend to continue premium growth within this segment via direct sales and acquisitions.
24090_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	Other Non-insurance Enterprises includes Computing Technology, Inc., which provides data processing services to the Company, and Insurance Investors, Inc., which provides aviation transportation to the Company.
24090_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	This segment also includes the results of Citizens, Inc., the parent Company.
24090_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our administrative operations primarily serve our life insurance segment and are conducted primarily at our executive offices in Austin, Texas through approximately 115 administrative, operating and underwriting personnel.
24090_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	Our Home Service operations are conducted to a large degree from our district offices in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, as well as our support center in Donaldsonville, Louisiana through approximately 67 operations personnel.
24090_13_ITEM1_P36_S2	At our executive offices, we also perform policy design, marketing oversight, underwriting, accounting and reporting, customer service, administration and investing activities.
24090_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our senior management has significant experience in insurance company application system design and implementation.
24090_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	Since the mid-1960's, our senior management has been leading development of evolving insurance applications.
24090_13_ITEM1_P37_S2	We have a single integrated system for our entire Company, which is a centrally-controlled, mainframe-based administrative system.
24090_13_ITEM1_P37_S3	Functions of our administrative system include policy set up, administration, billing and collections, commission calculation, valuation, automated internal audit functions, storage backup, image management and other related functions.
24090_13_ITEM1_P37_S4	Each company we acquire is ultimately converted onto our administrative system.
24090_13_ITEM1_P37_S5	This system has been in place for many years, and we believe it is a significant asset to us.
24090_13_ITEM1_P37_S6	We update our administrative system on an ongoing basis.
24090_13_ITEM1_P37_S7	This system is also capable of significant expansion without substantial capital outlay or increase in staff.
24090_13_ITEM1_P37_S8	Therefore, we believe we can achieve additional growth without costly administrative system expenditures, delays, failures or the addition of substantial staffing.
24090_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our U.S. insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations.
24090_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	State insurance laws establish supervisory agencies with broad regulatory authority to regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of each state in which they are licensed.
24090_13_ITEM1_P38_S2	In addition, U.S. laws, such as the USA Patriot Act of 2001, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the recently enacted Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("the Dodd-Frank Act"), are examples of U.S. regulation that affect our business.
24090_13_ITEM1_P38_S3	We are subject to comprehensive regulations under the USA Patriot Act with respect to money laundering, as well as federal regulations regarding privacy and confidentiality.
24090_13_ITEM1_P38_S4	Our insurance products and thus our businesses also are affected by U.S. federal, state and local tax laws.
24090_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act focuses on financial reform and may result in significant changes to the regulation of institutions operating in the financial services industry, including the Company.
24090_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	Legislative or regulatory requirements imposed by or promulgated in connection with this Act may make it more expensive for the Company to conduct its business, may have a material adverse effect on the overall business climate and could materially affect the profitability of the results of operations and financial condition of financial institutions.
24090_13_ITEM1_P39_S2	The Company is uncertain as to all of the impacts this new legislation will have and cannot provide assurance it will not adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1_P39_S3	In general, government regulation at the federal level may increase and may result in unpredictable consequences for the Company.
24090_13_ITEM1_P39_S4	In addition, other federal laws and regulations apply to us in areas such as pension regulations, privacy, tort reform and taxation.
24090_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	The purpose of the laws and regulations that affect our insurance business is primarily to protect our insureds and not our stockholders.
24090_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations.
24090_13_ITEM1_P40_S2	In addition, insurance regulatory authorities (including state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general) periodically make inquiries and regularly conduct examinations regarding compliance by us and our subsidiaries with insurance, and other laws and regulations regarding the conduct of our insurance businesses.
24090_13_ITEM1_P40_S3	We cooperate with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action when warranted.
24090_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are collectively licensed to transact business in 32 states.
24090_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	We have insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the states of Colorado, Louisiana and Texas.
24090_13_ITEM1_P41_S2	Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are licensed and regulated in all U.S. jurisdictions in which they conduct insurance business.
24090_13_ITEM1_P41_S3	The extent of this regulation varies, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations based upon the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) model rules governing the financial condition of insurers, including standards of solvency, types and concentration of investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, credit for reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy, and the business conduct of insurers, including marketing and sales practices and claims handling.
24090_13_ITEM1_P41_S4	In addition, statutes and regulations usually require the licensing of insurers and their agents, the approval of policy forms and related materials and the approval of rates for certain types of insurance products.
24090_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	All U.S. jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries conduct insurance business have enacted legislation that requires each U.S. insurance company in a holding company system, except captive insurance companies, to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its jurisdiction of domicile and to furnish that regulatory authority financial and other information concerning the operations of, and the interrelationships and transactions among, companies within its holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system.
24090_13_ITEM1_P42_S1	These laws and regulations also regulate transactions between insurance companies and their parents and affiliates.
24090_13_ITEM1_P42_S2	Generally, these laws and regulations require that all transactions within a holding company system between an insurer and its affiliates be fair and reasonable and that the insurer's statutory capital and surplus following any transaction with an affiliate be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.
24090_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	Statutory surplus is the excess of admitted assets over the sum of statutory liabilities and capital.
24090_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	For certain types of agreements and transactions between an insurer and its affiliates, these laws and regulations require prior notification to, and non-disapproval or approval by, the insurance regulatory authority of the insurer's jurisdiction of domicile.
24090_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	The payment of dividends or other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by the insurance laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile.
24090_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	The laws and regulations of some of these jurisdictions also prohibit an insurer from declaring or paying a dividend except out of its earned surplus or require the insurer to obtain regulatory approval before it may do so.
24090_13_ITEM1_P44_S2	In addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employee or other services) if they determine such payment could be adverse to policyholders or insurance contract holders of the subsidiary.
24090_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled require that a controlling party obtain the approval of the insurance commissioner of the insurance company's jurisdiction of domicile prior to acquiring control of the insurer and may delay, deter or prevent a transaction our shareholders might consider desirable.
24090_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	Risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements are imposed on life and property and casualty insurance companies.
24090_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	The NAIC has established minimum capital requirements in the form of RBC.
24090_13_ITEM1_P46_S2	RBC factors the type of business written by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company's business to develop a minimum level of capital called "authorized control level risk-based capital" and compares this level to adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves.
24090_13_ITEM1_P46_S3	Should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk-based capital fall below 200%, a series of actions by the affected company would begin.
24090_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	Government actions in response to the recent financial crisis and market volatility could significantly impact our current regulations.
24090_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	As part of a comprehensive reform of financial services regulation known as the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress established an office within the federal government to collect information about the insurance industry, recommend standards, and represent the United States in dealing with foreign insurance regulators.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investing in our Company involves certain risks.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Set forth below are certain risks with respect to our Company.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Readers should carefully review these risks, together with the other information contained in this report.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties we have described in this report are not the only ones we face.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem not material, may also adversely affect our business.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Any of the risks discussed in this report or that are presently unknown or not material, if they were to actually occur, could result in a significant adverse impact on our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	References in the risk factors below to "we," "us," "our," "Citizens" and like terms relate to Citizens, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statement basis, unless specifically identified otherwise.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We operate our subsidiaries as separate and distinct entities with respect to corporate formalities.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	A substantial amount of our revenue comes from foreign residents and is subject to risks associated with foreign insurance laws, political instability and asset transfer restrictions.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	A substantial part of our insurance policy sales are from foreign countries, primarily those in Latin America and the Pacific Rim.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	There is a risk that we may lose a significant portion of these sales should adverse events occur in these countries.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We seek to address this risk by, among other things, not accepting insurance applications outside of the U.S., maintaining all of our assets in the U.S. and requiring policy premiums be paid to us in U.S. Dollars drawn on U.S. financial institutions.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Accordingly, we have never qualified to do business in any foreign country and have never submitted our insurance policies issued to foreign residents for approval by any foreign or domestic insurance regulatory agency.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We sell our policies to foreign residents using foreign independent marketing firms and independent consultants, and we rely on those persons to comply with applicable laws in marketing our insurance products.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The government of a foreign country could determine its residents may not buy life insurance from us unless we became qualified to do business in that country or unless our policies purchased by its residents receive prior approval from its insurance regulators.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Also, new laws or regulations could be implemented or new applications of existing laws or regulations could occur, which could result in the cessation of marketing activities by our independent marketing firms and consultants.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	From time to time we have become aware of new foreign laws, regulations or new interpretations of foreign laws or regulations that may have an adverse effect on the marketing efforts of our foreign independent marketing firms and consultants.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We cannot assure you any of these laws, regulations, or application of them by foreign regulatory authorities will not have an adverse effect on the marketing efforts of our independent marketing firms and consultants and, in turn, on our revenues.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Further, there is no assurance we would be able to qualify to do business in any foreign country or that its insurance regulatory authorities would approve our policies if we decided to submit our insurance policies for approval.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We could also face sanctions, including fines and penalties, if a country's authorities determined any failure to qualify or otherwise comply with its laws was willful or ongoing.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Any of the foregoing could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Additionally, we do not determine whether our independent consultants are required to be licensed to sell insurance in the countries in which they market our policies.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P6_S6	If our independent consultants were not in compliance with applicable laws, including licensing laws, they could be required to cease operations, which would reduce our revenues.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P6_S7	We have not obtained any advice of counsel in any foreign jurisdictions with respect to these matters.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P6_S8	We are unable to quantify the effect of foreign regulation on our business if regulation were to be imposed on us, but we believe we could expend substantial amounts of time and incur substantial expense in complying with any foreign regulation, and we may decide to withdraw from or avoid a market if foreign regulation were imposed.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Additionally, if economic or political crises were to occur in any of the countries where our foreign policyowners reside, our revenues could be adversely affected.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Also, currency control laws, regulations and decrees in foreign countries, if implemented, could materially adversely affect our revenues by imposing restrictions on asset transfers outside of a country where our insureds reside.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	There can be no assurance that such situations will not occur and that our revenues, results of operations and financial condition will not be materially, adversely affected if they do occur.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The majority of our foreign policyholders choose to invest their policy dividends or other cash benefits in our Class A common stock through the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan (the "Plan").
24090_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If a securities regulatory authority were to deem the Plan's operation contrary to applicable securities laws, we risk facing fines and penalties and cease and desist orders which would create a reduction in the amount of Class A common stock purchased on the open market through the Plan.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The offer and sale of our Class A common stock through the Plan is not registered under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Most all of our foreign policyholders participate in the Plan and choose to invest dividends paid on their insurance policies in our Class A common stock pursuant to the Plan.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We have not obtained any advice of counsel in any foreign jurisdiction as to whether such participation by foreign residents in the Plan is subject to foreign securities laws or regulations or whether our independent consultants in these jurisdictions are subject to licensing requirements in connection with foreign policyholder participation in the Plan.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If a foreign securities regulatory authority were to determine the offer and sale of our Class A common stock under the Plan were contrary to applicable laws and regulations of its jurisdiction, we could be faced with cease and desist orders, fines and penalties, or reduced participation in the Plan by our foreign policyholders.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P10_S4	This also could materially reduce the amount of our Class A common stock purchased and sold in the open market under the Plan, as historically a significant volume of shares have been purchased under the Plan through issuance of policy cash benefits assigned to the Plan.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P10_S5	We could also be faced with private disputes relating to the Plan, including the possibility of securities law claims within the United States.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P10_S6	In the absence of countervailing considerations, we would expect to defend any such claims and we could incur significant defense costs, including not only attorneys' fees and other direct litigation costs, but also the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P10_S7	This could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The previous registration statement covering the Plan was not declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933 and sales under the Plan may not have fully complied with an exemption from registration under that Act.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	As a result, security holders who purchased shares of Class A common stock may have a right to rescind their purchases or other damages.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In 2001, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") covering the sale of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to a predecessor to the Plan.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In 2006, the Plan was amended and an agent independent of us was appointed to administer the Plan.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	On December 18, 2006, the registration statement was amended to increase the number of shares registered and to reflect the amendments to the Plan.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P12_S3	On December 18, 2009, we filed a further amendment to the registration statement.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P12_S4	The registration statement and amendments treated the Plan and its predecessors as a dividend or interest reinvestment plan and, accordingly, the registration statements on Form S-3 were filed in a manner so that they would be deemed effective upon filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission").
24090_13_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Upon further analysis and consideration in connection with the preparation of a further amendment to the registration statement, on December 17, 2012 we determined that the Plan may not meet the criteria of a "dividend or interest reinvestment plan" as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act, and that previous sales may not have been exempt from registration under the Securities Act.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Accordingly, we did not believe we could file an amendment to the registration statement on Form S-3 that would be effective upon filing with the Commission.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P12_S7	As a result, as of the close of business on December 18, 2012, we suspended operation of the Plan with respect to the purchase of Class A common stock.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P12_S8	On December 21, 2012, we filed with the Commission a Registration Statement on form S-3 with respect to the Plan (the "New Registration Statement"), which was declared effective by the Commission on January 14, 2013.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If and to the extent participants in the Plan were sold shares of Class A common stock that were not effectively registered under the Securities Act, or exempt from such registration, prior to the time the New Registration Statement was declared effective such participants could have certain remedies available to them, including claims for rescission and damages.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In the 12 months prior to December 19, 2012, a total of approximately 1,544,250 shares of Class A common stock were purchased in the open market under the Plan for participants in the Plan for an aggregate of approximately $15,210,000, or an average of $9.85 per share.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In addition, the Commission could commence an enforcement action against us seeking injunctive or other relief and civil damages.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Should a significant number of these purchasers bring claims for rescission or damages, or should the Commission commence an enforcement action, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and reputation and our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	As an insurance holding company with significant investment exposure, we face material financial and capital markets risk in our operations.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Due to the low interest rate environment over the past three years, we experienced significant call activity on our fixed income portfolio which has decreased our investment yields compared to prior years.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Also, we recorded other-than-temporary impairments ("OTTI") in the past several years due to credit related market declines.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	as well as reduced new insurance policy sales, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Economic uncertainty has recently been exacerbated by the increased potential for default by one or more European sovereign debt issuers, the potential partial or complete dissolution of the Eurozone and its common currency and the negative impact of such events on global financial institutions and capital markets generally.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Actions or inactions of European governments may impact these actual or perceived risks.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In the recent past, one rating agency downgraded the U.S.'s long-term debt credit rating from AAA.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Future actions or inactions of the United States government, including a shutdown of the federal government, could increase the actual or perceived risk that the U.S. may not ultimately pay its obligations when due and may disrupt financial markets.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Changes in market interest rates may significantly affect our profitability.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Some of our products, principally traditional whole life insurance with annuity riders, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our "spread," or the difference between the amounts we are required to pay under our contracts to policyholders and the rate of return we are able to earn on our investments intended to support obligations under the contracts.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our spread is a key component of our net income.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured, prepaid, been sold, or called at lower yields, reducing our investment margin.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our fixed income bond portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk as a significant portion of the portfolio is callable.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Lowering interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in investment margins on some of our products.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	However, our ability to lower these rates could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates, and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Our expectation of future spreads is an important component in amortization of deferred acquisition costs and significantly lower spreads may result in increasing amortization, thereby reducing net income for the period.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our investment portfolio is subject to various risks that may result in realized investment losses.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In particular, decreases in the fair value of fixed maturities may significantly reduce the value of our investments, and as a result, our financial condition may suffer.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations under these securities could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in the recognition of investment losses.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the bonds included in our portfolio and by other factors that may result in the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In particular, at December 31, 2012 , fixed maturities represented $791.5 million or 87.9% of our total investments of $900.7 million .The fair value of fixed maturities and the related investment income fluctuates depending on general economic and market conditions.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The fair value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us will generally increase or decrease in line with changes in market interest rates.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	An investment has prepayment risk when there is a risk that the timing of cash flows resulting from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We experienced significant prepayments of bonds in our investment portfolio over the past three years.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The impact of value fluctuations affects our consolidated financial statements, as a large portion of our fixed maturities are classified as available-for- sale, with changes in fair value reflected in our stockholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss).
24090_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	No similar adjustment is made for liabilities to reflect a change in interest rates.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Therefore, interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect our stockholders' equity, total comprehensive income and/or cash flows.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	For mortgage-backed securities, credit risk exists if mortgagees default on the underlying mortgages.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Although at December 31, 2012 , approximately 97.3% of our fixed maturities were investment grade with 55.2% rated AA or above, all of our fixed maturities are subject to credit risk.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	If any of the issuers of our fixed maturities suffer financial setbacks, the ratings on the fixed maturities could fall (with a concurrent fall in fair value) and, in a worst case scenario, the issuer could default on its financial obligations.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P29_S3	If the issuer defaults, we could have realized losses associated with the impairment of the securities.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	A substantial portion of our investment portfolio is concentrated in U.S. Government sponsored corporations and agencies.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	At December 31, 2012 , we had investments with a carrying value of $114.2 million ( 14.4% of our total invested assets) in U.S. Government sponsored corporations and agencies, including the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie") and the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie").
24090_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Both Freddie and Fannie are currently in conservatorship, certain of their operations are being combined and the federal government is considering proposals to phase them out, or allow them to continue as private corporations, among other things.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If they are wound down, it is not clear how investments sponsored by them might be affected; however, the direct and indirect impact on our investment portfolio could be material and could be adverse.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities may be realized or result in future impairments, resulting in a reduction in our net income.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and are, therefore, excluded from our net income.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Our total gross unrealized losses on our available-for-sale securities portfolio at December 31, 2012 were $1.1 million .
24090_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	The accumulated change in estimated fair value of these securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is realized upon sale of the security or in the event that the decline in estimated fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary and an impairment charge to earnings is taken.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Realized losses or impairments may have a material adverse effect on our net income in a particular quarterly or annual period.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims and we may be required to establish additional reserves, which in turn may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We maintain reserves to cover our estimated exposure for claims relating to our issued insurance policies.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Reserves, whether calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") or statutory accounting practices prescribed by various state insurance regulators, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections, of what we expect claims will be based on mortality assumptions that are determined by various regulatory authorities.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Many reserve assumptions are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P35_S3	In addition, when we acquire other domestic life insurance companies, our assessment of the adequacy of acquired policy liabilities is subject to our estimates and assumptions.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops, and adjustments to reserves are reflected in our statements of operations for the period in which such estimates are updated.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, future developments may require us to increase claims reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the periods in which such increases occur.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the costs of customer relationships acquired, which would increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	At December 31, 2012 , we had $135.6 million of deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	DAC represents costs that vary with and are primarily related to the successful sale and issuance of our insurance policies and are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P37_S2	These costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions, solicitation and printing costs, sales material costs and some support costs, such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Under U.S. GAAP, DAC is amortized to income over the lives of the underlying policies, in relation to the anticipated recognition of premiums.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	In addition, when we acquire a block of insurance policies, we assign a portion of the purchase price to the right to receive future net cash flows from existing insurance and investment contracts and policies.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	This intangible asset, called the cost of customer relationships acquired, or CCRA, represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	At December 31, 2012 , we had $25.1 million of CCRA.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P39_S3	We amortize the value of this intangible asset in a manner similar to the amortization of DAC.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our amortization of DAC and CCRA generally depends upon anticipated profits from investments, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, persistency and maintenance expense margins.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	For example, if our insurance policy lapse and surrender rates were to exceed the assumptions upon which we priced our insurance policies, or if actual persistency proves to be less than our persistency assumptions, especially in the early years of a policy, we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	to determine if they are recoverable from future income.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If these costs are not recoverable, they are charged to expenses in the financial period in which we make this determination.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses, investment returns, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, lapses or persistency may cause us to increase the amortization of DAC or CCRA, or both, or to record a current period expense to increase benefit reserves, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We may be required to recognize an impairment on the value of our goodwill, which would increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the amount paid by us to acquire various life insurance companies over the fair value of their net assets at the date of the acquisition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Under U.S. GAAP, we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the "reporting unit" level, which is either an operating segment or a business that is one level below the operating segment.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Goodwill is impaired if its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P45_S2	This may occur for various reasons, including changes in actual or expected earnings or cash flows of a reporting unit, generation of earnings by a reporting unit at a lower rate than similar businesses or declines in market prices for publicly traded businesses similar to our reporting units.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P45_S3	If any portion of our goodwill becomes impaired, we would be required to recognize the amount of the impairment as a current-period expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Goodwill in our consolidated financial statements was $17.2 million as of December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We are a defendant in lawsuits, which may adversely affect our financial condition and detract from the time our management is able to devote to our business, and we are subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory matters.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We may from time to time be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our business operations, including, but not limited to:
24090_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	disputes relating to businesses acquired and operated by us.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	In the absence of countervailing considerations, we would expect to defend any such claims vigorously.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	However, in doing so, we could incur significant defense costs, including attorneys' fees, other direct litigation costs and the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	If we suffer an adverse judgment as a result of any claim, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	By letter dated September 7, 2012, three state departments of treasury (or equivalent state agencies) notified the Company they intend to audit Citizens, Inc. and certain of its affiliates for compliance with unclaimed property laws.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	As of December 31, 2012, all three states have agreed to allow the Company to complete its own internal audit before the end of the second quarter of 2013.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P50_S2	The audits may result in additional payments to beneficiaries, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws, administrative penalties, interest, and changes to the Company's procedures for the identification and escheatment of abandoned property.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P50_S3	At this time, the Company is not able to estimate any of these possible amounts, but such costs could be substantial for a company our size.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Reinsurers with which we do business could increase their premium rates and may not honor their obligations, leaving us liable for the reinsured coverage.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We reinsure certain risks underwritten by our various insurance subsidiaries.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P52_S2	The high cost of reinsurance or lack of affordable coverage could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	or at rates economic to us.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling or unable to bear an increase in net exposures, we may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P54_S2	In addition, our reinsurance facilities may be cancelled, pursuant to their terms, upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including a change of control of our Company (generally defined as the acquisition of 10% or more of our voting equity securities) or the failure of our insurance company subsidiaries to maintain the minimum required levels of statutory surplus.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Any of these potential developments could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	In 2012 , we reinsured $466.9 million of face amount of our life insurance policies.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Amounts reinsured in 2012 represented 10.1% of the face amount of direct life insurance in force in that year.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Although the cost of reinsurance is, in some cases, reflected in premium rates, under certain reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer may increase the rate it charges us for reinsurance.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P56_S1	If our cost of reinsurance were to increase, we might not be able to recover these increased costs, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P56_S2	See Note 5 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We may not be able to continue our past strategy of acquiring other U.S. life insurance companies, and we may not realize improvements to our financial results as a result of our past or any future acquisitions.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We have acquired 16 U.S. life insurance companies since 1987.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Our objective in this strategy has been to increase our assets, revenues and capital, improve our competitive position and increase our earnings, in part by realizing certain operating efficiencies associated with economies of scale.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We evaluate possible acquisitions of other insurance companies on an ongoing basis.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P59_S1	While our business model is not dependent primarily upon acquisitions, the time frame for achieving or further improving our market positions can be shortened through acquisitions.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P59_S2	There can be no assurance that suitable acquisitions presenting opportunities for continued growth and operating efficiencies will be available to us, or that we will realize the anticipated financial results from completed acquisitions.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P59_S3	In addition, we face intense competition in seeking to make acquisitions, much of which is from companies with greater financial and human resources than we have.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Even if we identify and complete insurance company acquisitions, we may be unable to integrate them on an economically favorable basis.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Implementation of an acquisition strategy entails a number of risks, including, among others, inaccurate assessment of assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities and the failure to achieve anticipated operating efficiencies, revenues, earnings or cash flow.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P61_S1	The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our international and domestic operations face significant competition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our international marketing plan focuses on making available U.S. Dollar-denominated life insurance products to high net worth, high income individuals residing in more than 30 countries.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P63_S1	New competition could increase the supply of available insurance, which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive profitable rates to us, thereby adversely affecting our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Existing barriers to entry in the foreign markets we serve may not be sufficient to impede potential competitors from entering such markets.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P63_S3	In connection with our business with foreign nationals, we experience competition primarily from the following sources, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have:
24090_13_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Foreign operated companies with U.S. Dollar policies.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We face direct competition from companies that operate in the same manner as we operate in our international markets.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Companies foreign to the countries in which their policies are sold but that issue local currency policies.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Another group of our competitors in the international marketplace consists of companies that are foreign to the countries in which their policies are sold but issue life insurance policies denominated in the local currencies of those countries.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Local currency policies provide the benefit of assets located in the country of foreign residents, but entail risks of uncertainty due to local currency fluctuations, as well as the perceived instability and weakness of local currencies.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Locally operated companies with local currency policies.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P68_S1	We compete with companies formed and operated in the country in which our foreign insureds reside.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Generally, these companies are subject to risks of currency fluctuations, and they primarily use mortality tables based on experience of the local population as a whole.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P68_S3	These mortality tables are typically based on significantly shorter life spans than those we use.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P68_S4	As a result, the cost of insurance from these companies tends to be higher than ours.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P69_S0	than do our independent marketing firms and independent consultants, there can be no assurance that these companies will not endeavor to place a greater emphasis on our target market and compete more directly with us.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P70_S0	In the United States, we compete with more than 1,000 other life insurance companies of various sizes.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The life insurance business in the United States is highly competitive, in part because it is a mature industry that, in recent years, has experienced little to no growth in life insurance sales.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Many domestic life insurance companies have substantially greater financial resources, longer business histories and more diversified lines of insurance coverage than we do.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P71_S2	These companies also have larger sales forces than we have.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P71_S3	Competition in the United States has also increased recently because the life insurance industry is consolidating, with larger, more efficient organizations emerging from the consolidation.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P72_S0	In addition, from time to time, companies enter and exit the markets in which we operate, thereby increasing competition at times when there are new entrants.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P72_S1	We may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices, or for other reasons.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P73_S0	There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in any of our markets.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P73_S1	If we do not, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Sales of our products may be reduced if we are unable to (i) establish and maintain commercial relationships with independent marketing firms and independent consultants (ii) attract and retain employee agents or (iii) develop and maintain our distribution sources.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We distribute our insurance products through several distribution channels, including independent marketing firms and independent consultants and our employee agents.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P75_S1	These relationships are significant for both our revenues and our profits.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P75_S2	In our life insurance segment, we depend almost exclusively on the services of independent marketing firms and independent consultants.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P75_S3	In our home service insurance segment, we depend on employee agents whose role in our distribution process is integral to developing and maintaining relationships with policyholders.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Significant competition exists among insurers in attracting and maintaining marketers of demonstrated ability.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Some of our competitors may offer better compensation packages for marketing firms, independent consultants and agents and broader arrays of products and have a greater diversity of distribution resources, better brand recognition, more competitive pricing, lower cost structures and greater financial strength or claims paying ratings than we do.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P76_S2	We compete with other insurers for marketing firms, independent consultants and employee agents primarily on the basis of our compensation and support services.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P76_S3	Any reduction in our ability to attract and retain effective sales representatives could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Loss of the services of our senior management team would likely hinder development of our operating and marketing programs and our strategy for expanding our business.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We rely on the active participation of our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Harold E. Riley (age 84 ), and our Vice Chairman of the Board and President, Rick D. Riley (age 59 ), in connection with the development and execution of our operating and marketing plans and strategy for expanding our business.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P78_S1	We anticipate that their expertise will continue to be of substantial value in connection with our operations.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P78_S2	The loss of the services of either of these individuals could have a significant adverse effect on our business and prospects.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P78_S3	We do not have an employment agreement with either of these persons nor do we carry a key-man insurance policy on either of their lives.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the United States, which increases our costs of doing business and could restrict the conduct of our business.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in U.S. jurisdictions wherein we do business, as well as anti-money laundering regulations adopted under the USA Patriot Act.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Insurance company regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, with substantially lesser protections to shareholders of the regulated insurance companies.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P81_S1	To that end, all the states in which we do business have insurance regulatory agencies with broad powers under law with respect to such things as: licensing companies to transact business; mandating capital and surplus requirements; regulating trade and claims practices; approving policy forms; and restricting companies' ability to enter and exit markets.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P82_S0	The capacity for an insurance company's growth in premiums is partially a function of its required statutory surplus.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus, as measured by statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by a company's state of domicile, is considered important by all state insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Failure to maintain required levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action by regulatory authorities.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Most insurance regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant, renew, suspend and revoke licenses and approvals, and could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities, including acquisitions of other insurance companies, require us to add capital to our insurance company subsidiaries, or fine us.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P83_S1	If we are unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, or if our insurance business is determined not to comply fully with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations and their interpretations, including the USA Patriot Act, our revenues, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Although the U.S. federal government has not historically regulated the insurance business, the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, expands the federal presence in insurance oversight.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P84_S1	The Act's requirements include streamlining the state-based regulation of reinsurance and non-admitted insurance (also known as surplus lines insurance, which is property or casualty insurance written by a company that is not licensed to sell policies of insurance in a given state).
24090_13_ITEM1A_P84_S2	This legislation also establishes a new Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury with powers over all lines of insurance except health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P84_S3	The Federal Insurance Office is authorized to, among other things, gather data and information to monitor aspects of the insurance industry, identify issues in the regulation of insurers about insurance matters and preempt state insurance measures under certain circumstances.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P84_S4	As this Act calls for numerous studies and contemplates further regulation, the future impact of the Act on our results of operations or our financial condition cannot be determined at this time, but could have an adverse impact on profitable operations.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Changes in U.S. regulation may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and limit our prospective growth.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Currently, the U.S. Federal Government does not directly regulate the insurance business, although initiatives for Federal regulation of insurance are proposed by members of the U.S. Congress from time to time.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P86_S1	However, Federal legislation and administrative policies in several other areas can materially and adversely affect insurance companies, including our business.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P86_S2	These areas include the USA Patriot Act, financial services regulation, securities regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P86_S3	In addition, various forms of direct federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Our failure to maintain effective information systems could adversely affect our business.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We must maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop new information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P88_S1	If we do not maintain adequate systems, we could experience adverse consequences, including products acquired through acquisition, inadequate information on which to base pricing, underwriting and reserve decisions, regulatory problems, failure to meet prompt payment obligations, increases in administrative expenses and loss of customers.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Some of our information technology systems and software are mainframe-based, legacy-type systems that require an ongoing commitment of resources to maintain current standards.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Our systems utilize proprietary code requiring highly skilled personnel.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P89_S2	Due to the unique nature of our proprietary operating environment, we could have difficulty finding personnel with the skills required to provide ongoing system maintenance and development as we seek to keep pace with changes in our products and business models, information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and policyholder needs.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P89_S3	Our success is dependent upon, among other things, maintaining and enhancing the effectiveness of existing systems, as well as continuing to integrate, develop and enhance our information systems to support business processes in a cost-effective manner.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Our failure to protect confidential information and privacy could result in the loss of customers, subject us to fines and penalties and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to privacy regulations.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P92_S1	The actions we take to protect confidential information include among other things: monitoring our record retention plans and policies and any changes in state or federal privacy and compliance requirements; maintaining secure storage facilities for tangible records; and limiting access to electronic information in order to safeguard certain information.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P93_S0	In addition, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires that we deliver a notice regarding our privacy policy both at the delivery of an insurance policy and annually thereafter.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Certain exceptions are allowed for sharing of information under joint marketing agreements.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P94_S1	However, certain state laws may require us to obtain a policyholder's consent before we share information.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P95_S0	We have a written information security program with appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect such confidential information.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P95_S1	If we do not comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information, we could experience adverse consequences, including regulatory sanctions, loss of reputation and litigation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P96_S0	The insurance industry in which we operate may be subject to periodic negative publicity, which may negatively impact our financial results.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P97_S0	We interface with and distribute our products to individual consumers.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P97_S1	There may be a perception that these purchasers may be unsophisticated and in need of consumer protection.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P97_S2	Accordingly, from time to time, consumer advocate groups or the media may focus attention on our products, thereby subjecting the insurance industry to periodic negative publicity.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P97_S3	We may also be negatively impacted if other insurance companies engage in practices resulting in increased public attention to our businesses.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P97_S4	Negative publicity may result in lower sales of insurance, lower persistency of our insurance products, increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation, which may further increase our costs of doing business and impede our ability to market our products.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P97_S5	As a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P98_S0	General economic, financial market and political conditions may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected from time to time by general economic, financial market and political conditions, both in the United States and in the foreign countries where our policyowners reside.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P99_S1	These conditions include economic cycles such as: levels of consumer spending; levels of inflation; movements of the financial markets; availability of credit; fluctuations in interest rates, monetary policy or demographics; and legislative and competitive changes.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P100_S0	During periods of economic downturn, such as the ones recently experienced, our insureds may choose not to purchase our insurance products, may terminate existing policies, permit policies to lapse or may choose to reduce the amount of coverage purchased, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P100_S1	Also, our sales of new insurance policies might decrease.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by applicable laws and regulations in the amounts of fees, dividends and other distributions they may make to us.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P101_S1	The inability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us in sufficient amounts for us to conduct our operations could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations or expand our business.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P102_S0	As a holding company, our principal asset is the stock of our subsidiaries.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P102_S1	We rely primarily on statutorily permissible payments from our insurance company subsidiaries, principally through service agreements we have with our subsidiaries, to meet our working capital and other corporate expenses.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P102_S2	The ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to make payments to us is subject to regulation by the states in which they are domiciled, and these payments depend primarily on approved service agreements between us and these subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, the statutory surplus (which is the excess of assets over liabilities as determined under statutory accounting practices prescribed by an insurance company's state of domicile), future statutory earnings (which are earnings as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices) and regulatory restrictions.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Generally, the net assets of our insurance company subsidiaries available for dividends are limited to either the lesser or greater (depending on the state of domicile) of the subsidiary's net gain from operations during the preceding year and 10% of the subsidiary's net statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Except to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of our subsidiaries' creditors, including policyholders, have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors and shareholders.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P104_S1	If any of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates or otherwise reorganizes, our creditors and shareholders will have no right to proceed in their own right against the assets of that subsidiary or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of the subsidiary under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to debt and equity capital and our cost of capital in seeking to expand our business.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P106_S0	The capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility over the past several years.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P106_S1	In some cases, the markets exerted significant downward pressure on availability of debt and equity capital for certain issuers (including short term liquidity and credit capacity).
24090_13_ITEM1A_P106_S2	We believe the availability of debt and equity capital has decreased significantly compared to prior years.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P107_S0	The availability of equity and debt financing to us will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit capacity, as well as the possibility that investors or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P107_S1	Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets may also limit our access to equity capital for us to seek to expand our business.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P107_S2	As such, we may be forced to delay raising debt or equity capital, or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could adversely affect our ability to seek any acquisitions and negatively impact profitability of an acquisition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Unexpected losses in future reporting periods may require us to adjust the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P109_S0	We evaluate our deferred tax asset ( DTA ) quarterly for recoverability based on available evidence.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P109_S1	This process involves management's judgment about assumptions, which are subject to change from period to period due to tax rate changes or variances between our projected operating performance and our actual results.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P109_S2	Ultimately, future adjustments to the DTA valuation allowance, if any, will be determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P110_S0	The realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry back or carry forward periods under applicable tax law.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we may be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P111_S1	Such an adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and capital position.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P112_S0	The price of our Class A common stock may be adversely affected by decreased participation in the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan (the "Plan").
24090_13_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Most all of our international policyholders participate in the Plan and they invest their policy dividends and benefits in our Class A common stock pursuant to the Plan.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P113_S1	Once a policyholder elects to participate in the Plan, his or her policy benefits are assigned to purchase Citizens Class A common stock under the Plan in the open market.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P113_S2	There is a risk our Class A common stock price could be negatively impacted by a decrease in our policyholders' participation in the Plan.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P113_S3	If fewer policyholders elect to participate in the Plan, or our international premium collections were to decrease as a result of regulatory, economic, or marketing impediments, the trading volume of our Class A stock may decline from its present levels and the demand for our Class A common stock could be negatively impacted.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P114_S0	Control of our Company, through the ownership of our Class B Common Stock, may be held by a 501(c)(3) charitable foundation established by our Founder and we cannot determine whether any change in our management, operations, or operating strategies will occur as a result of such an ownership change.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P115_S0	Harold E. Riley, our Founder, Chairman and CEO, is the beneficial owner of 100% of the Citizens Class B common stock, which is held in the name of the Harold E. Riley Trust ("Trust"), of which he serves as Trustee.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P115_S1	Citizens' Class A and Class B common stock are identical in all respects, except the Class B common stock elects a simple majority of the Board and receives one-half of any cash dividends paid, on a per share basis, to the Class A shares.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P115_S2	Therefore, Mr. Riley controls our Company.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P115_S3	The Class A common stock elects the remainder of the Board.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P115_S4	The Trust documents provide that upon Mr. Riley's death, the Class B common stock will be transferred from the Trust to the Harold E. Riley Foundation, a charitable organization established under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Foundation").
24090_13_ITEM1A_P115_S5	In addition, the Trust documents provide that Mr. Riley may at any time transfer the Class B common stock held by the Trust to the Foundation.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P115_S6	It is unclear what, if any, changes would occur to our board, management structure, or corporate operating strategies as a result of different ownership of our Class B common stock.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P116_S0	There are a substantial number of our issued shares of Class A common stock eligible for future sale in the public market.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P116_S1	The sale of these shares could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fall.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P117_S0	There were 49,080,114 shares of our Class A common stock issued as of December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM1A_P117_S1	Our executive officers, directors and management owned approximately 3,249,273 shares of our Class A common stock as of December 31, 2012 , representing approximately 7% of our then outstanding Class A common stock.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P117_S2	Almost all of these shares have been registered for public resale and generally may be sold freely.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P117_S3	In the event of a sale of some or all of these shares or the perceived sale of these shares, the market price of our Class A common stock could fall substantially.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P118_S0	The price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Our Class A common stock price has historically fluctuated and is likely to fluctuate in the future and could decline materially because of the volatility of the stock market in general, decreased participation in the Plan referred to above or a variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: quarterly or annual variations in actual or anticipated results of our operations; interest rate fluctuations; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; competition and other factors affecting the life insurance business generally; and conditions in the U.S. and world economies.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P120_S0	Our Class A common shareholders do not control us and have a limited ability to influence our business policies and corporate actions and are not by themselves able to elect any of our directors.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P121_S0	It is difficult for Class A common shareholders to elect any of our directors or otherwise exert any significant influence over our business.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P121_S1	The sole holder of our outstanding Class B common stock is entitled to elect a simple majority of our board of directors and therefore controls us.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P121_S2	All of our Class B common stock is currently owned by the Harold E. Riley Trust, of which Harold E. Riley, our founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, is the sole trustee.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P121_S3	Additionally, Harold E. Riley beneficially owns approximately 5% of the issued shares of our Class A common stock.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P122_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as applicable state insurance laws, may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P123_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as various state insurance laws, may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a takeover attempt our shareholders might consider in their best interests.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P123_S1	As a result, our shareholders will be prevented from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our Class A common stock that may be offered by a bidder in a takeover context.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P123_S2	Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P124_S0	The following provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws make it difficult for our Class A shareholders to replace or remove our directors and have other anti-takeover effects that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt:
24090_13_ITEM1A_P125_S0	our board of directors may issue one or more series of preferred stock without the approval of our shareholders.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P126_S0	State insurance laws generally require prior approval of a change in control of an insurance company.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P126_S1	Generally, such laws provide that control over an insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the insurer.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P127_S0	In considering an application to acquire control of an insurer, an insurance commissioner generally will consider such factors as the experience, competence and financial strength of the proposed acquirer, the integrity of the proposed acquirer's board of directors and executive officers, the proposed acquirer's plans for the management and operation of the insurer, and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the acquisition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P127_S1	In addition, a person seeking to acquire control of an insurance company is required in some states to make filings prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and the target insurance company and their affiliates have sufficiently large market shares in particular lines of insurance in those states.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P127_S2	These state insurance requirements may delay, deter or prevent our ability to complete an acquisition.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P128_S0	We have never paid any cash dividends on our Class A common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P129_S0	We have never paid cash dividends on our Class A common stock, as it is our policy to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business.
24090_13_ITEM1A_P129_S1	We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
24090_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	We own our principal office in Austin, Texas, consisting of an 80,000 square foot office building in addition to approximately one acre of land nearby that houses storage facilities.
24090_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	Approximately 50,000 square feet is occupied or reserved for our operations.
24090_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also own a training facility at Lake Buchanan, Texas.
24090_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	In addition, we own other properties in Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana that are incidental to our operations.
24090_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are a defendant in a lawsuit filed on August 6, 1999, in the Texas District Court, Austin, Texas, now styled Delia Bolanos Andrade, et al., Plaintiffs, v. Citizens Insurance Company of America, et al., Defendants in which a class was originally certified by the trial court and reversed by the Texas Supreme Court in 2007 with an order to the trial court to conduct further proceedings consistent with its ruling.
24090_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	The underlying lawsuit alleged that certain life insurance policies CICA made available to non-U.S. residents, when combined with a policy feature that allowed certain cash benefits to be assigned to two non-U.S. trusts for the purpose of accumulating ownership of our Class A common stock, along with allowing the policyholders to make additional contributions to the trusts, were actually offers and sales of securities that occurred in Texas by unregistered dealers in violation of the Texas securities laws.
24090_13_ITEM3_P0_S2	The remedy sought was rescission and return of the insurance premium payments.
24090_13_ITEM3_P0_S3	On December 9, 2009, the trial court denied the recertification of the class after conducting additional proceedings in accordance with the Texas Supreme Court's ruling.
24090_13_ITEM3_P0_S4	The remaining plaintiffs must now proceed individually, and not as a class, if they intend to pursue their claims against us.
24090_13_ITEM3_P0_S5	Since the December 9, 2009 trial court ruling, no individual cases have been further pursued by the plaintiffs.
24090_13_ITEM3_P0_S6	The probability of the plaintiffs further pursuing their cases individually is unknown.
24090_13_ITEM3_P0_S7	An estimate of any possible loss or range of losses cannot be made at this time in regard to individuals pursuing claims.
24090_13_ITEM3_P0_S8	However, should the plaintiffs further pursue their claims individually, we intend to vigorously defend any proceedings.
24090_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	SPFIC is vigorously defending a lawsuit filed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and currently pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.
24090_13_ITEM3_P1_S1	This matter was filed by the Louisiana Attorney General against SPFIC and every other homeowner insurer doing business in the State of Louisiana, on behalf of the State of Louisiana, as assignee, and on behalf of certain Road Home fund recipients.
24090_13_ITEM3_P1_S2	Although this lawsuit was originally filed as a class action, the Louisiana Attorney General moved to dismiss the class in 2011 and the motion was granted.
24090_13_ITEM3_P1_S3	In this matter the State alleged that the insurers failed to pay all damages owed under their policies.
24090_13_ITEM3_P1_S4	The claims currently pending in this matter are for breach of contract and for declaratory relief on the alleged underpayment of claims by the insurers.
24090_13_ITEM3_P1_S5	All other claims, including extra-contractual claims, have been dismissed.
24090_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	The District Court has issued a case management order requiring the State to produce specific detail by property supporting its breach of contract allegations.
24090_13_ITEM3_P2_S1	Additionally, the case management order requires the State to deliver a settlement proposal to SPFIC and the other defendant insurance companies.
24090_13_ITEM3_P2_S2	Since, there are many potential individual claims at issue in this matter, each will require individual analysis and a number of which may be subject to individual defenses, including release, accord and satisfaction, prescription, waiver, and estoppel.
24090_13_ITEM3_P2_S3	There has been no discovery in connection with this matter.
24090_13_ITEM3_P3_S0	SPFIC believes its claims practices in connection with Katrina homeowners claims were sound and in accordance with industry standards and state law.
24090_13_ITEM3_P3_S1	There remain significant questions of Louisiana law that have yet to be decided.
24090_13_ITEM3_P3_S2	SPFIC intends to vigorously defend all claims asserted in any remaining proceedings.
24090_13_ITEM3_P3_S3	Therefore, in SPFIC's judgment given the issues discussed above, an estimate of probable loss cannot be made at this time.
24090_13_ITEM3_P4_S0	SPFIC is vigorously defending a number of matters in various stages of development filed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in addition to the Road Home Litigation, including a number of individual lawsuits, which are immaterial to the Company's financial statements.
24090_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol CIA.
24090_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	Quarterly high and low closing prices per share of our Class A common stock as reported by the NYSE are shown below.
24090_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	The number of stockholders on record on March 4, 2013 was as follows:
24090_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	We have never paid cash dividends on our Class A or B common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
24090_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	We did not purchase any of our equity securities during any quarter in 2010 , 2011 or 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	We do not maintain any equity compensation plans or arrangements.
24090_13_ITEM5_P5_S1	Thus, we do not have any securities authorized for issuance under these types of plans, nor have we issued any options, warrants or similar instruments to purchase any of our equity securities.
24090_13_ITEM5_P6_S0	The following graph compares the change in the Company s cumulative total stockholder return on its common stock over a five-year period.
24090_13_ITEM5_P6_S1	Composite and the Hemscott Group Index, a peer group of major U.S.-based insurance companies.
24090_13_ITEM5_P7_S0	The peer group index weights individual company returns for stock market capitalization.
24090_13_ITEM5_P7_S1	The companies included in the peer group index are shown in the following table.
24090_13_ITEM5_P8_S0	Symetra Financial Corp. FBL Financial Group, Inc.
24090_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table presents selected financial data of the Company.
24090_13_ITEM6_P0_S1	This should be read in conjunction with Item 7.
24090_13_ITEM6_P0_S2	"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 8.

24090_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," for information that may affect the comparability of the financial data contained in the above table.
24090_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following is management's discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations of the Company.
24090_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	It is intended to be a discussion of certain key financial information regarding the Company and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes to this report on Form 10-K.
24090_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	We conduct operations as an insurance holding company emphasizing ordinary life insurance products in niche markets where we believe we can achieve competitive advantages.
24090_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	As an insurance provider, we collect premiums on an ongoing basis to pay future benefits to our policy and contract holders.
24090_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company derives its revenues principally from 1) premiums earned for insurance coverages provided to insureds; 2) net investment income; and 3) net realized capital gains and losses.
24090_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Profitability of our insurance operations depends heavily upon the Company s underwriting discipline, as we seek to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, management of claims, use of reinsurance, the size of our in force block, actual mortality and morbidity experience, and our ability to manage our expense ratio, which we accomplish through economies of scale and management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses.
24090_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future losses based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the Company s response to competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels.
24090_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Company seeks to price our insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin.
24090_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	For many of our insurance products, the Company is required to obtain approval for the premium rates from state insurance departments.
24090_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	The profitability of fixed annuities, riders and other spread-based product features depends largely on the Company s ability to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on assets and interest credited to policyholders.
24090_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	The investment return, or yield, on invested assets is an important element of the Company s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before benefits are paid.
24090_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	The majority of the Company s invested assets have been held in available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, primarily in asset classes of corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and government obligation bonds.
24090_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	The current and projected low interest rate environment is having a significant impact on the determination of insurance contract liabilities and assets regarding reserves and deferred acquisition costs.
24090_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	The primary investment objective for the Company is to maximize economic value, consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including the management of credit risk and interest rate sensitivity of invested assets, while generating sufficient after-tax income to meet policyholder and corporate obligations.
24090_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Company maintains a conservative investment strategy that may vary based on a variety of factors including business needs, regulatory requirements and tax considerations.
24090_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our assets grew from $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2011 , to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	Total stockholders' equity increased from $248.0 million at December 31, 2011 , to $263.1 million at December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Net investment income increased 5.4% and 3.0% for 2012 and 2011 , respectively, and was flat in 2010 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	The average yield on the consolidated investment portfolio has declined significantly from a yield of 4.20% in 2010 down to 3.92% in 2011 and continued to decline at a more moderate pace to a yield of 3.81% in 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	The increase in the investment asset balances due to premium revenue growth was sufficient to offset the lower yield in the declining rate environment and resulted in an increase in net investment income.
24090_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Realized net investment gains in the past three years resulted primarily from sales of securities that had been previously impaired due to declines in market values.
24090_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	These gains were partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments on investment securities and other long-term assets that were recorded in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 of $1,319,000 , $631,000 and $27,000 , respectively, reported as realized losses.
24090_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Claims and surrenders expense increased 7.7% from the comparable period in 2011 as the home service segment was impacted by Hurricane Isaac which hit the Louisiana coast on August 29, 2012 and caused increased property claims.
24090_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	In addition, death claims expense in the current year is higher compared to 2011 due to the release of incurred but unreported death claims liability in 2011 of $0.7 million.
24090_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Changes in reserves resulted in liability increases from greater sales of endowment products that build up reserves at a faster pace than whole life longer term mortality based products.
24090_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	Additionally, the sustained low interest rate environment also results in a higher reserve development due to the lower interest yield assumptions in the current period compared to prior years.
24090_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	For over thirty-five years, CICA and its predecessors have accepted policy applications from foreign nationals for U.S. Dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies.
24090_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	We make our insurance products available using third-party marketing organizations and independent marketing consultants.
24090_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Endowment product sales have been on the rise and represented approximately 81% of new sales.
24090_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	The Company offers a ten, fifteen and twenty year endowment and our top selling endowment is a product that matures at age sixty-five.
24090_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	We also introduced a new product in 2011 that is an endowment at age eighteen with a payout over four or five years.
24090_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Through the domestic market of our Life Insurance segment, we provide ordinary whole life, credit life insurance, and final expense policies to middle and lower income families and individuals in certain markets in the mid-west and southern U.S.
24090_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	The majority of our domestic revenues are generated by the operations of domestic life insurance companies we have acquired since 1987.
24090_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	We provide final expense ordinary life insurance to middle and lower income individuals in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	Our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through a home service marketing distribution system utilizing employee-agents who work on a route system to collect premiums and service policyholders, and through networks of funeral homes that collect premiums and provide personal policyholder service.
24090_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	Significant economic issues impacting our business and industry currently and into the future are discussed below.
24090_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	It is predicted that the interest rate environment will remain low for the foreseeable future, which translates into lower profit margins for insurers.
24090_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	We have been impacted by the historically low interest rate environment over the past several years as our fixed income investment portfolio, primarily invested in callable securities, has been reinvested at lower yields.
24090_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	The Company s conservative investment strategy has not changed, but it has been a challenging investment time, as the large number of bond calls resulted in significant cash balances to be reinvested.
24090_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	The Company experienced some delays in reinvesting the funds as management identified suitable bonds meeting our target characteristics of investment grade and yield parameters were identified.
24090_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Costs ( DAC ) balances, as assumptions are used in the development of the balances.
24090_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	Due to the recent decline in investment yields on our portfolio, our projection of long-term investment returns has declined.
24090_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	This has resulted in increasing the reserves on policies issued in the current year, as well as reducing the DAC asset.
24090_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	As an increasing percentage of the world population reaches retirement age, we believe we will benefit from increased demand for living products rather than death products, as aging baby boomers will require cash accumulation to pay expenses to meet their lifetime needs.
24090_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	Our ordinary life products are designed to accumulate cash values to provide for living expenses in a policy owner's later years, while continuously providing a death benefit.
24090_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	We believe there is a trend toward consolidation of domestic life insurance companies, due to significant losses incurred by the life insurance industry as a result of the credit crisis and recent economic pressures, as well as increasing costs of regulatory compliance for domestic life insurance companies.
24090_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	We believe this trend should be a benefit to our acquisition strategy as more complementary acquisition candidates may become available for us to consider.
24090_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Many of the events and trends affecting the life insurance industry have had an impact on the life reinsurance industry.
24090_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	These events have led to a decline in the availability of reinsurance.
24090_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	While we currently cede a limited amount of our primary insurance business to reinsurers, we may find it difficult to obtain reinsurance in the future, forcing us to seek reinsurers who are more expensive to us.
24090_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	If we cannot obtain affordable reinsurance coverage, either our net exposures will increase or we will have to reduce our underwriting commitments.
24090_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	While our management has more than 40 years of experience in writing life insurance policies for foreign residents, changes related to foreign government laws and regulations and application of them, along with currency controls affecting our foreign resident insureds could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	In 2008, the Company acquired Ozark National Life Insurance Company ( ONLIC ), an Arkansas domiciled life company.
24090_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	This entity provided an Arkansas field force of home service agents and funeral homes selling pre-need and final expense policies and was merged into SPLIC as of October 1, 2009, and is included in the Home Service segment.
24090_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	In the first quarter of 2009, the Company completed its acquisition of Integrity Capital Corporation ("ICC").
24090_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	ICC is the parent of Integrity Capital Insurance Company ("ICIC"), an Indiana life insurance company.
24090_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	Both ICC and ICIC were merged into CICA effective April 1, 2011.
24090_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	On August 1, 2011, SPLIC entered into assumption reinsurance agreements with Escude Life Insurance Company in Rehabilitation, and Benton Life Insurance Company in Rehabilitation.
24090_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	At the time the agreements were executed, both companies were under receivership with the Louisiana Department of Insurance.
24090_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	In total, SPLIC assumed approximately $4.5 million in reserve liabilities and received approximately $4.6 million in cash, with a minimal reinsurance ceding commission being paid.
24090_13_ITEM7_P31_S3	These transactions are accounted for under business combination accounting and are not deemed material.
24090_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	A discussion of consolidated results is presented below, followed by a discussion of Segment Operations and financial results by segment.
24090_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Insurance revenues are primarily generated from premium revenues and investment income.
24090_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	In addition, realized gains and losses on investment holdings can significantly impact revenues from year to year.
24090_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Premium income derived from life, accident and health, and property insurance sales, increased 5.3% during 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	The increase resulted primarily from renewal premiums, which totaled $142.2 million , $135.1 million and $127.1 million in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
24090_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	New sales, termed as first year premiums, increased 6.1%, 6.6% and 2.1% in the life segment in 2012, 2011 and 2010.
24090_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	Endowment sales represent a significant portion of new business sales internationally with the 20 year endowment and endowment to age 65 as our top products.
24090_13_ITEM7_P34_S4	In addition, most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision, which allows the policyholder to use cash value of a policy to pay premiums.
24090_13_ITEM7_P34_S5	The policy loan asset balance increased 10.0% and 9.8% in 2012 and 2011, year over year.
24090_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	Net investment income increased to $31.7 million in 2012 compared to $30.1 million in 2011 , despite a decline in the yield on investments as we experienced higher average invested assets as a result of investment of new premium revenue.
24090_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Net investment income performance is summarized as follows.
24090_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Yields on invested assets vary between segment operations due to different portfolio mixes in the segments.
24090_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	The life segment has a higher concentration in U.S. government securities while the home service segment has a larger concentration in the corporate and municipal sectors.
24090_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	We have traditionally invested in fixed maturity securities with a large percent held in callable issues.
24090_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	Over the past three years, we have experienced significant call activity related to fixed maturity security holdings due to the historically low interest rate environment.
24090_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	As these call proceeds were primarily invested into lower yielding securities, the yield on the portfolio has declined.
24090_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	lesser impact relative to yield changes.
24090_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	If market interest rates begin to rise, our call risk would diminish and our portfolio yield will rise over time, as new money investments would be made at higher rates.
24090_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	Investment income from fixed maturity securities accounted for approximately 82.3% of total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	We have reduced investment holdings in bonds of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, such as Federal National Mortgage Association ( FNMA ) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( FHLMC ), which comprised 15.3% of the total fixed maturity portfolio based on amortized cost at December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	We have increased our investment purchases of corporate and municipal securities over the past several years, focusing on utility service sectors in these security categories.
24090_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	In addition, we reinvested proceeds from bond calls totaling $10.0 million into equity securities related to bond mutual funds in 2011 and continuing into 2012.
24090_13_ITEM7_P41_S3	These securities offer a competitive yield with a shorter duration.
24090_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	Investment income from fixed maturity investments increased for the year of 2012 due to a rise in investment holdings based upon amortized cost of $28.8 million.
24090_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	The increase in earnings on asset balances of fixed maturity and equity securities from new money investments is offsetting the 11 basis point yield decline for the year.
24090_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	In addition, the increase in the policy loans asset balance, which represents policyholders utilizing their accumulated policy cash value, contributed to the increase to investment income.
24090_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments .
24090_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	In 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , the Company sold equity mutual funds, which were previously impaired, and realized gains of $0.6 million , $1.3 million and $6.4 million , respectively.
24090_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	Realized investment gains (losses) are as follows.
24090_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	Included in net realized investment gains and losses are OTTI on investments.
24090_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	We recorded an OTTI write-down in 2012 of $1,319,000 related to one coal powered energy issuer debt security holding which has a maturity date in 2017.
24090_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	In 2011 we recorded an OTTI of $70,000 related to one American Airlines ( AMR ) debt security holding that had a maturity date in 2012.
24090_13_ITEM7_P45_S3	AMR declared bankruptcy in November of 2011.
24090_13_ITEM7_P45_S4	We also recorded an impairment in 2011 of $0.6 million related to an investment property that was acquired as part of the ONLIC acquisition in 2008.
24090_13_ITEM7_P45_S5	A current appraisal reflected a declining value of this Arkansas office building from the fair value at acquisition.
24090_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	Decrease in Fair Value of Warrants .
24090_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	In 2012, all of the remaining warrants outstanding were either exercised or converted into our Class A common stock, due to an election by the warrant holders, or expiration.
24090_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	We recognized a gain on the decrease in fair value of warrants of $0.5 million, $1.1 million and $0.2 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
24090_13_ITEM7_P46_S3	The 2012 and 2011 gain was the result of the significant decrease in the number of warrants outstanding due to expirations and exercises.
24090_13_ITEM7_P46_S4	The gain in 2010 was directly related to the decrease in the price of our Class A common stock.
24090_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	The warrant liability was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which projects the future value of the warrants when they expire.
24090_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	Current accounting standards require the change in the value of the warrant liability be recorded as a component of revenues.
24090_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	When the liability increased we incurred a loss, and when the liability decreased we recognized income.
24090_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	As noted in the table below, claims and surrenders increased from $60.1 million in 2011 to $64.7 million in 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	The Company monitors death claims based upon expectations.
24090_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	The claims experience was unfavorable in 2012 , increasing by 8.3% from 2011 recorded amounts.
24090_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	These values may routinely fluctuate from year to year.
24090_13_ITEM7_P49_S3	Additionally, 2011 results include a $0.8 million incurred but not reported release of liability related to our claim expense calculation.
24090_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	Policy surrenders increased in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , but remained at a level that represents approximately 0.5% of direct ordinary whole life insurance inforce.
24090_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	The increase in surrender expense is primarily related to our international business and is expected to increase over time due to the aging of this block of business.
24090_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	A significant portion of surrenders relates to policies that have been in force over fifteen years and no longer have a surrender charge associated with them.
24090_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	Total direct insurance inforce reported in 2012 and 2011 was $4.6 billion compared to $4.5 billion in 2010 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Endowment benefits increased in each of the last three years.
24090_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	We have a series of international policies that carry an immediate endowment benefit of an amount selected by the policy owner.
24090_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	These benefits have been popular in the Pacific Rim and Latin America, where the Company has experienced increased interest in our guaranteed products in recent years.
24090_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	Like policy dividends, annual guaranteed endowments are factored into the premium and, as such, the increase has no impact on profitability.
24090_13_ITEM7_P54_S3	The Company expects these benefits to continue to increase as this block of business increases and persists.
24090_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	Property claims increased 16% to approximately $2.3 million in 2012 compared with the amount reported for 2011 due to Hurricane Issac claims experience in the current year with $0.5 million uninsured losses.
24090_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	The 2010 reported property claim amounts were lower than historical experience.
24090_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	The change in future policy benefit reserves has increased 14.4% and 25.5% in 2012 and 2011 due primarily to the current low interest rate environment necessitating higher reserves for policies issued in the last few years due to lower long term yield projections compared to prior assumptions.
24090_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	In addition, we continue to experience growth in new sales of endowment products, which require higher initial reserve levels, than whole life products.
24090_13_ITEM7_P56_S2	Endowment sales totaled approximately $14.3 million , $12.3 million and $9.4 million in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
24090_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Policyholder dividends have risen at a rate corresponding with the growth rate in new international life insurance premiums.
24090_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	The Company issues long duration participating policies to foreign residents that are expected to pay dividends to policyholders based upon actual experience.
24090_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	Policyholder dividends are factored into the premiums and have no impact on profitability.
24090_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	Commission expense fluctuates in a direct relationship to new and renewal insurance premiums and has increased 2.7% in 2012 compared to 2011 as premium revenues have increased.
24090_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Total general expenses decreased over the past several years on a consolidated basis as management has created efficiencies and improved processes.
24090_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	The decrease year to year was primarily related to lower audit, legal and consulting fees, as well as employee benefit cost reductions.
24090_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	We moved to a self insurance health plan for our employees in 2010 and have successfully decreased our overall benefit expenses.
24090_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	We perform an expense study on an annual basis, utilizing an enterprise-wide time study, and we adjust cost allocations among entities as needed based upon this review.
24090_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	Any allocation changes are reflected in the segment operations, but do not impact total expenses.
24090_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	Capitalized deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") were $29.1 million , $27.8 million and $26.2 million in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	These costs will vary based upon successful efforts related to newly issued policies and renewal business.
24090_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	Significantly lower amounts are capitalized related to renewal business in correlation with the lower commissions paid on that business compared to first year business which have higher commission rates.
24090_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is impacted by persistency and may fluctuate from year to year.
24090_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	Amortization costs increased in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of the asset balance growth.
24090_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	Policy persistency was comparable in the life segment for the periods presented, but declined in the Home Service segment in 2012 and 2011, resulting in higher amortization.
24090_13_ITEM7_P62_S3	In addition, the prolonged low interest rate environment impacted the assumptions used in the development of the DAC asset for new policies issued in 2012 and 2011.
24090_13_ITEM7_P62_S4	This resulted in a lower DAC balance and increased amortization by approximately $0.4 million and $1.4 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
24090_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	Cost of Customer Relationships Acquired and Other Intangibles .
24090_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	The higher amortization in 2010 and 2011 was related primarily to the ICC acquisition and greater amortization due to the increase in lapses on this new block of business.
24090_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	The current year amortization level recorded in 2012 is indicative of what we expect going forward or until we make additional acquisitions.
24090_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	Federal income tax expense was $1.5 million , $2.8 million and $3.7 million in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of 25.0% , 25.1% and 20.0% , respectively.
24090_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	The Company began purchasing tax-exempt state and local bonds in the second half of 2011 and continued to do so in 2012 in the non-insurance companies where the full tax benefit can be realized.
24090_13_ITEM7_P64_S2	In addition, the fair value change related to outstanding warrants of $0.5 million , $1.1 million , and $0.2 million were reported as an increase in revenues in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 respectively, which was not taxable and also impacted our corporate tax rate.
24090_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	Differences between our effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate result from income and expense items that are treated differently for financial reporting and tax purposes.
24090_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Our business is comprised of three operating business segments, as detailed below.
24090_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	Our insurance operations are the primary focus of the Company, as those segments generate the majority of our income.
24090_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	The amount of insurance, number of policies, and average face amounts of policies issued during the periods indicated are shown below.
24090_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	These segments are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
24090_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	The Company evaluates profit and loss performance based on net income before federal income taxes.
24090_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	Our Life Insurance segment primarily issues ordinary whole life insurance in U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents in approximately 30 countries through approximately 1,500 independent marketing consultants, and domestically through over 400 independent marketing firms and consultants throughout the United States.
24090_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	Premium revenues increased for 2012 compared to 2011 and 2010 , due to higher international renewal premiums, which have experienced strong persistency as this block of insurance ages.
24090_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	First year premiums increased in the current year, reflecting improved new business production in all products internationally.
24090_13_ITEM7_P71_S2	Sales from Colombia, Ecuador, Taiwan and Venezuela represented the majority of the first year premium increase.
24090_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	Endowment sales represent a significant portion of new business sales internationally, as these products continue to exceed our whole life sales in the current markets.
24090_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	In addition, most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision, which allows the policyholder to use cash value of a policy to pay premiums.
24090_13_ITEM7_P72_S2	The policy loan asset balance increased 10.2% year over year.
24090_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	Life Insurance premium breakout is detailed below.
24090_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	The following table sets forth, by country, our direct premiums from our international life insurance business for the periods indicated.
24090_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	Our international business and premium collections could be impacted by future changes relative to laws, regulations or economic events in the countries from which we accept applications.
24090_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	The following table sets forth our direct premiums by state from our domestic business for the periods indicated.
24090_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	A number of domestic life insurance companies we acquired had blocks of accident and health insurance policies which we have ceded under a coinsurance agreement with an unaffiliated insurance company.
24090_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	Under the agreement, the other company assumes substantially all of our accident and health policies.
24090_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	The premium amounts ceded under the coinsurance agreement in the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 were $3.9 million , $4.5 million and $5.3 million , respectively.
24090_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	Net investment income has been negatively impacted by the low interest rate environment, which has resulted in declining portfolio yields, as discussed in the Consolidated Results of Operations above.
24090_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	Realized gains of $0.5 million , $1.3 million and $6.6 million were recognized in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , due primarily to disposals of previously impaired equity mutual funds.
24090_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	A breakout of claims and surrender benefits is detailed below.
24090_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	Death claims expense increased 5.3% in 2012 compared to 2011 due to more reported claims in the current year but were below the level experienced in 2010.
24090_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	In addition, 2011 results included a $0.2 million release of incurred but not reported liability related to our claim experience calculation.
24090_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	Mortality experience is closely monitored by the Company as a key performance indicator and these amounts were within expected levels.
24090_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	The increase in surrender expense is primarily related to our international business and is expected to increase over time due to the aging of this block of business.
24090_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	The majority of policy surrender benefits paid is attributable to our international business and was related to policies that have been in force over fifteen years, where surrender charges are no longer applicable.
24090_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	Endowment benefit expense results from the election by policyholders of a product feature that provides an annual benefit.
24090_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	This is a fixed benefit over the life of the contract, and this expense will increase with new sales and improved persistency.
24090_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	Other policy benefits increased in the current year due primarily to interest paid on premium deposits and dividend accumulations, as these policyholder liability accounts have increased.
24090_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	Increase in Future Policy Benefit Reserves .
24090_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	Policy benefit reserves in 2012 increased compared to the same periods in 2011 , primarily from the effect of the current low interest rate environment on reserve development for policies issued in the last few years which have higher reserve build up compared to prior issue years.
24090_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	The accounting guidance of long duration contracts we sell requires the Company to lock in the original assumptions such as mortality, interest, surrenders and expenses at the time the initial policies are written, therefore gains or losses attributable to actual experience that differs from the original assumptions flows through the income statement in the period where in the differences occur.
24090_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	In addition, reserves have risen year over year for all periods presented due to the increased sales of endowment products, which build up reserve balances more quickly compared to other life product sales.
24090_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	million , $12.3 million and $9.4 million , representing approximately 81.9% , 69.4% and 56.5% of total new first year premium in 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 , respectively.
24090_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	Policyholder dividends have risen at a rate that corresponds with the growth rate in new international life insurance premiums.
24090_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	The Company issues long duration participating policies to foreign residents that are expected to pay dividends to policyholders based upon actual experience.
24090_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	Policyholder dividends are factored into the premiums and have no impact on profitability.
24090_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	Capitalization and Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs .
24090_13_ITEM7_P91_S1	Capitalized costs increased, as commission related costs have increased in the current year compared to 2011 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P91_S2	Amortization of DAC increased in the current year by 9.5% from 2011 as the asset balance has increased.
24090_13_ITEM7_P91_S3	Amortization in 2010 was up compared to the two more recent years due to worse persistency experience in that particular year compared to both 2012 and 2011.
24090_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	Commission expense increase is directly related to the increase in premiums as noted above.
24090_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	First year policy premiums pay a higher commission rate than renewal policy premiums.
24090_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	The expenses are allocated by segment, based upon an annual expense study performed by the Company, and were down due to lower audit and actuarial fees as well as employee benefit related costs.
24090_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	Our Home Service Insurance segment provides pre-need and final expense ordinary life insurance and annuities to middle and lower income individuals primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	Our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through funeral homes and a home service marketing distribution system utilizing over 550 employees and independent agents.
24090_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	The premium increases were due to the fact that this segment is continuing to report marginal growth primarily in Louisiana.
24090_13_ITEM7_P96_S1	Also, there is an increase of approximately $180,000 of single premium due to a one time adjustment as noted below under Policyholders' dividends.
24090_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	The following table sets forth our direct premiums by state for the periods indicated.
24090_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	Net investment income has been negatively impacted by the low interest rate environment, which has resulted in declining portfolio yields as discussed in the Consolidated Results of Operations above.
24090_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	Net investment income for our home service insurance segment is summarized as follows:
24090_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	Realized Investment Gains (Losses), Net .
24090_13_ITEM7_P100_S1	Net losses on investment of $0.3 million in 2012 is related to an OTTI adjustment on one coal energy provider debt issuer.
24090_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	The operations of this energy provider have been negatively impacted by challenging environment in the coal-fired generation sector and overall decline in the price of power it can charge to customers.
24090_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	This fixed maturity security is scheduled to mature in 2017.
24090_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	Net realized losses of $0.6 million in 2011 are due primarily from an OTTI on one American Airlines debt security that totaled $70,000 due to the issuer filing bankruptcy, and a write-down of approximately $0.5 million related to investment real estate for an office building in Arkansas.
24090_13_ITEM7_P103_S1	We obtained an appraisal in 2011 that reflected a loss in fair value.
24090_13_ITEM7_P103_S2	Gains of $1.5 million in 2010 related primarily to sales of below investment grade securities that were added to the portfolio as part of an acquisition and had been previously impaired.
24090_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	A breakout of claims and surrender benefits is detailed below.
24090_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	Death claims expense was higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to more reported claims in the current year.
24090_13_ITEM7_P105_S1	In addition, 2011 results include a $0.6 million incurred but not reported release of liability related to our claim experience calculation.
24090_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	Mortality experience is closely monitored by the Company as a key performance indicator and these amounts were within expected levels.
24090_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	Surrender benefits have increased in 2012 and 2011 compared to 2010, as the Home Service block grows, and is consistent with expectations for the current economic conditions.
24090_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	Increase in Future Policy Benefit Reserves .
24090_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	The current year change in reserves reflects increased lapse experience in 2012 compared to 2011 and 2010.
24090_13_ITEM7_P108_S2	We believe the increase in lapses are due to Hurricane Isaac and economic pressures from increased unemployment.
24090_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	The increase in 2012 compared to prior years results from a manual adjustment that has now been properly set up in the policy administration system to properly reflect increasing policy values from annual paid up additions.
24090_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	This one time increase in dividends paid and single premium revenue of approximately $180,000 has no impact on the overall segment earnings for the quarter or nine months.
24090_13_ITEM7_P109_S2	The reserve liability had been previously set up relative to this policy feature and was decreased by $35,000 based upon the system calculated value.
24090_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	Commission expense decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 and 2010 because agents are compensated based upon month-to-month route premium growth that has been impacted by increased policy lapses.
24090_13_ITEM7_P110_S1	This results in a lower commission to premium relationship as compensation is reduced.
24090_13_ITEM7_P110_S2	In addition, we have consolidated some collection routes, which resulted in elimination of one district office and its related staffing thereby also reducing the commission expense.
24090_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	The expenses are allocated by segment based upon an annual expense study performed by the Company and were down in 2012 due to lower audit and actuarial fees as well as employee benefit related costs.
24090_13_ITEM7_P111_S1	Other general expenses decreased in 2011 compared to 2010, due to an overall decrease in expenses and a reallocation of expenses that became effective January 1, 2011, which reduced the home service segment allocation by $1.5 million and increased the life segment allocation for that year.
24090_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	Capitalization and Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs ("DAC") .
24090_13_ITEM7_P112_S1	DAC capitalization is directly correlated to fluctuations in first year commissions.
24090_13_ITEM7_P112_S2	Amortization in 2012 and 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily because we experienced a higher lapse rate in the two most recent years in this segment.
24090_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	We monitor lapse rates as a key component of our insurance operations.
24090_13_ITEM7_P113_S1	Amortization in 2011 includes an adjustment that resulted in an increase of $0.3 million due to a refinement in an estimate using system generated information related to SPLIC assumptions.
24090_13_ITEM7_P113_S2	Amortization reported in 2010 is impacted by an adjustment that decreased amortization by $0.3 million in that reporting period.
24090_13_ITEM7_P114_S0	Overall, other non-insurance operations are relatively immaterial to the consolidated results, except for the fair value adjustment related to the Company's warrants to purchase Class A common stock.
24090_13_ITEM7_P114_S1	These amounts have fluctuated due to the movement in our Class A common stock price and fair value calculation for warrants using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
24090_13_ITEM7_P114_S2	There are no warrants outstanding at the end of 2012.
24090_13_ITEM7_P115_S0	Financial stability and the prevention of capital erosion are important investment considerations for the Company.
24090_13_ITEM7_P116_S0	A primary investment goal is the conservation of assets due to the long-term nature of a significant portion of our liabilities.
24090_13_ITEM7_P116_S1	The administration of our investment portfolios is handled internally, pursuant to board-approved investment guidelines, with all trading activity approved by a committee of each entity s respective board of directors of our insurance company subsidiaries.
24090_13_ITEM7_P116_S2	The guidelines used require that bonds, both government and corporate, are of high quality, investment grade and comprise a majority of the investment portfolio.
24090_13_ITEM7_P116_S3	State insurance statutes prescribe the quality and percentage of the various types of investments that may be made by insurance companies and generally permit investment in qualified state, municipal, federal and foreign government obligations, high quality corporate bonds, preferred and common stock, mortgage loans and real estate within certain specified percentages.
24090_13_ITEM7_P116_S4	The assets selected are intended to mature in accordance with the average maturity of the insurance products and to provide the cash flow for our insurance company subsidiaries to meet their respective policyholder obligations.
24090_13_ITEM7_P117_S0	The following table shows the carrying value of our investments by investment category and cash and cash equivalents, and the percentage of each to total invested assets.
24090_13_ITEM7_P118_S0	(1) Includes $6.1 million and $8.1 million of U.S. Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprise for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
24090_13_ITEM7_P118_S1	(2) Includes $292.6 million and $123.5 million of securities guaranteed by third parties for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
24090_13_ITEM7_P119_S0	The current year decline in U.S. government-sponsored securities is due to call activity from this sector and reinvestment into fixed maturity corporate and municipal bond categories.
24090_13_ITEM7_P119_S1	The Company has increased investments in municipals primarily related to Build America taxable bonds, essential services and corporate issuer holdings in the utility sector.
24090_13_ITEM7_P120_S0	At December 31, 2012 , investments in fixed maturity and equity securities were 88.2% of our total cash, and cash equivalents and investments.
24090_13_ITEM7_P120_S1	All of our fixed maturities were classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P120_S2	We had no fixed maturity or equity securities that were classified as trading securities at December 31, 2012 or 2011 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P121_S0	As previously discussed, our investment portfolios have been impacted significantly by the low interest rate environment over the past several years.
24090_13_ITEM7_P121_S1	The following table shows investment yields by segment operations as of December 31 for each year presented.
24090_13_ITEM7_P122_S0	Yields on investment assets vary between segment operations due to different portfolio mixes in the segments.
24090_13_ITEM7_P122_S1	The life segment invests more in U.S. Government securities while the home service segment has a larger concentration in the corporate and municipal sectors.
24090_13_ITEM7_P122_S2	The following table shows the breakdown between segments by investment bond category based on amortized cost.
24090_13_ITEM7_P123_S0	Credit ratings reported for the periods indicated are assigned by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ("NRSRO") such as Moody s Investors Service, Standard Poor s and Fitch Ratings.
24090_13_ITEM7_P123_S1	A credit rating assigned by a NRSRO is a quality based rating, with AAA representing the highest quality and D the lowest, with BBB and above being considered investment grade.
24090_13_ITEM7_P123_S2	In addition, the Company may use credit ratings of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") Securities Valuation Office ("SVO") as assigned, if there is no NRSRO rating.
24090_13_ITEM7_P123_S3	Securities rated by the SVO are grouped in the equivalent NRSRO category as stated by the SVO and securities that are not rated by a NRSRO are included in the "other" category.
24090_13_ITEM7_P124_S0	The following table shows the distribution of the credit ratings of our portfolio of fixed maturity securities by carrying value.
24090_13_ITEM7_P125_S0	The Company made new investments in the A and BBB credit category of taxable municipals and corporate bonds, primarily public utility issuers with an average maturity of seven years.
24090_13_ITEM7_P125_S1	The increase in non-investment grade securities was due to downgrades of issuers in the current period, as the Company does not purchase below investment grade securities.
24090_13_ITEM7_P126_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company held municipal securities that include third party guarantees.
24090_13_ITEM7_P126_S1	Detailed below is a presentation by NRSRO rating of our municipal holdings by funding type.
24090_13_ITEM7_P127_S0	The Company was not exposed to holding investments in any category under special revenue bond that were greater than 10% based upon activity as of December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P128_S0	The tables below represent the Company s detailed exposure of municipal holdings in Louisiana and Texas, which exceed 10% of the total municipal portfolio as of December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P129_S0	The Company invests in municipal securities of issuers in the state of Louisiana and receives a credit that reduces its premium tax liability in that state.
24090_13_ITEM7_P129_S1	At December 31, 2012 , total holdings of municipal securities in Louisiana represented 15.5% of all municipal holdings based upon fair value.
24090_13_ITEM7_P129_S2	The Company also holds 20.3% of its municipal holdings in Texas issuers.
24090_13_ITEM7_P130_S0	There were no other states or individual issuer holdings that represented or exceeded 10% of the total municipal portfolio as of December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P131_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of our fixed maturity and equity securities at least quarterly.
24090_13_ITEM7_P132_S0	The Company monitors all debt and equity securities on an on-going basis relative to changes in credit ratings, market prices, earnings trends and financial performance, in addition to specific region or industry reviews.
24090_13_ITEM7_P133_S0	The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on a case-by-case evaluation of underlying reasons for the decline in fair value.
24090_13_ITEM7_P134_S0	The Company determines other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) by reviewing all relevant evidence related to the specific security issuer as well as the Company's intent to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost.
24090_13_ITEM7_P135_S0	When an OTTI has occurred, the amount of the OTTI recognized in earnings depends on whether the Company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis.
24090_13_ITEM7_P135_S1	If the Company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, an OTTI is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_13_ITEM7_P135_S2	If the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Company is required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the OTTI will be separated into the following: a) the amount representing the credit loss; and b) the amount related to all other factors.
24090_13_ITEM7_P135_S3	The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings.
24090_13_ITEM7_P135_S4	The amount of the total OTTI related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_13_ITEM7_P135_S5	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_13_ITEM7_P135_S6	The new amortized cost is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value.
24090_13_ITEM7_P136_S0	We recorded an OTTI write-down in 2012 of $1,319,000 related to one coal powered energy issuer debt security holding which has a maturity date in 2017.
24090_13_ITEM7_P137_S0	The operations of this energy provider have been negatively impacted by the challenging environment in the coal-fired generation sector and overall decline in the price of power it can charge to customers.
24090_13_ITEM7_P137_S1	The Company recorded an OTTI of $70,000 in 2011 related to one American Airlines bond holding, as the issuer filed for bankruptcy.
24090_13_ITEM7_P137_S2	An additional impairment of $27,000 was recorded in 2010 to write a security down to zero carrying value.
24090_13_ITEM7_P137_S3	Based upon our emphasis on investing in fixed maturity securities primarily composed of obligations of U.S. Government-sponsored corporations and our analysis of whether declines in fair value below cost are temporary or other-than-temporary, management believes that our investments in fixed maturity investments at December 31, 2012 were not impaired, and no additional other-than-temporary losses need to be recorded.
24090_13_ITEM7_P138_S0	Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities available-for-sale amounted to $1.1 million as of December 31, 2012 and $3.0 million as of December 31, 2011 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P138_S1	This decrease in gross unrealized losses was due to a decrease in the interest rate environment.
24090_13_ITEM7_P138_S2	There were $0.2 million and $0.5 million of gross unrealized losses on equity securities as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P138_S3	In 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , the Company sold equity mutual fund holdings from the Life and Home Service segments and recorded realized gains of $0.6 million , $1.3 million and $6.4 million due to market recovery since impairment at December 31, 2008.
24090_13_ITEM7_P139_S0	As is customary among insurance companies, our insurance company subsidiaries reinsure with other companies portions of the life insurance risks they underwrite.
24090_13_ITEM7_P139_S1	A primary purpose of reinsurance agreements is to enable an insurance company to reduce the amount of risk on any particular life and, by reinsuring the amount exceeding the maximum amount the insurance company is willing to retain, to insure individuals in amounts larger than it could without such agreements.
24090_13_ITEM7_P139_S2	Even though a portion of the risk may be reinsured, our insurance company subsidiaries remain liable to perform all the obligations imposed by the policies issued by them and could be liable if their reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements.
24090_13_ITEM7_P140_S0	We believe we have established appropriate reinsurance coverage based upon our net retained insured liabilities compared to our surplus.
24090_13_ITEM7_P141_S0	The effect of reinsurance on premiums is as follows.
24090_13_ITEM7_P142_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries monitor the solvency of their reinsurers in seeking to minimize the risk of loss in the event of default by a reinsurer.
24090_13_ITEM7_P143_S0	The primary reinsurers of our insurance subsidiaries are large, well-capitalized entities.
24090_13_ITEM7_P144_S0	The effect of reinsurance on life insurance in force is as follows.
24090_13_ITEM7_P145_S0	Virtually all of the Company's non-credit accident and health insurance has been reinsured and is administered by Puritan Life Insurance Company of America, an unaffiliated party.
24090_13_ITEM7_P145_S1	The reinsurance recoverables under this agreement are collateralized by assets held in a trust for the benefit of the reinsured policies.
24090_13_ITEM7_P146_S0	The Company monitors the credit ratings of our life and property reinsurers.
24090_13_ITEM7_P146_S1	The ratings by A.M. Best Company range from B+ (Good) to A+ (Superior).
24090_13_ITEM7_P147_S0	SPFIC has first and second event catastrophe reinsurance coverage of $10.0 million per event and a retention level of $500,000 per event.
24090_13_ITEM7_P147_S1	Thus, the first $500,000 of incurred claims and any claims in excess of $10.0 million are SPFIC's responsibility.
24090_13_ITEM7_P148_S0	reinsurance premium for first event catastrophe reinsurance was $1,025,000 , $1,128,000 and $1,130,000 in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
24090_13_ITEM7_P149_S0	Liquidity refers to a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the needs of its operations.
24090_13_ITEM7_P149_S1	Liquidity is managed on insurance operations to ensure stable and reliable sources of cash flows to meet obligations and is provided by a variety of sources.
24090_13_ITEM7_P150_S0	Our liquidity requirements are met primarily by funds provided from operations.
24090_13_ITEM7_P150_S1	Premium deposits and revenues, investment income and investment maturities are the primary sources of funds, while investment purchases, policy benefits, and operating expenses are the primary uses of funds.
24090_13_ITEM7_P150_S2	We historically have not had to liquidate investments to provide cash flow, and there were no liquidity issues in 2012 or 2011 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P150_S3	Our investments consist of 87.9% of marketable debt securities and 5.5% of equity securities classified as available-for-sale that could be readily converted to cash for liquidity needs.
24090_13_ITEM7_P151_S0	A primary liquidity concern is the risk of an extraordinary level of early policyholder withdrawals.
24090_13_ITEM7_P151_S1	We include provisions within our insurance policies, such as surrender charges, that help limit and discourage early withdrawals.
24090_13_ITEM7_P151_S2	Since these contractual withdrawals, as well as the level of surrenders experienced, have been largely consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management, our associated cash outflows have, historically, not had an adverse impact on our overall liquidity.
24090_13_ITEM7_P152_S0	Individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy.
24090_13_ITEM7_P152_S1	Cash flow projections and cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios are also performed annually to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy.
24090_13_ITEM7_P153_S0	We currently anticipate that available liquidity sources and future cash flows will be adequate to meet our needs for funds.
24090_13_ITEM7_P154_S0	Cash flows from our insurance operations historically have been sufficient to meet current needs.
24090_13_ITEM7_P154_S1	Cash flows from operating activities were $69.3 million , $64.3 million and $60.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
24090_13_ITEM7_P154_S2	We have traditionally also had significant cash flows from both scheduled and unscheduled fixed maturity security calls, maturities, redemptions, and prepayments, which totaled $326.7 million , $283.3 million and $387.4 million in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P154_S3	These cash flows, for the most part, are reinvested in fixed income securities.
24090_13_ITEM7_P154_S4	Net cash outflows from investment activity totaled $50.0 million , $85.1 million and $62.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
24090_13_ITEM7_P154_S5	The outflows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily related to the investment of excess cash and cash equivalents generated from operations during 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P154_S6	The Company's cash flows from financing activities were $3.8 million in 2012 , $4.3 million in 2011 and $2.6 million in 2010 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P155_S0	The NAIC has established minimum capital requirements in the form of RBC.
24090_13_ITEM7_P155_S1	RBC considers the type of business written by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company's business to develop a minimum level of capital called "Authorized Control Level Risk-based Capital" and compares this level to an adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves.
24090_13_ITEM7_P155_S2	Should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk-based capital fall below 200%, a series of remedial actions by the affected company would be required.
24090_13_ITEM7_P156_S0	At December 31, 2012 , all of our insurance subsidiaries were above the required minimum RBC levels.
24090_13_ITEM7_P157_S0	In 2011 , CICA contributed 150,000 shares of Citizens, Inc.
24090_13_ITEM7_P157_S1	Class A common stock to CNLIC as a capital contribution due to minimum capital and surplus considerations.
24090_13_ITEM7_P157_S2	The contributed shares had a fair market contributed value of $1.1 million .
24090_13_ITEM7_P158_S0	Class A Common shares in 2012 from CTI with an approximate fair value of $0.5 million.
24090_13_ITEM7_P158_S1	These transactions have been eliminated under consolidation accounting rules.
24090_13_ITEM7_P159_S0	We have committed to the following contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 with the payments due by the period indicated below:
24090_13_ITEM7_P160_S0	The payments related to the future policy benefits and policy claims payable reflected in the table above have been projected utilizing assumptions based upon our historical experience and anticipated future experience.
24090_13_ITEM7_P161_S0	The Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2012 and, therefore, does not expect any future effects on the Company's financial condition related to any such arrangements.
24090_13_ITEM7_P162_S0	We do not utilize special purpose entities as investment vehicles, nor are there any such entities in which we have an investment that engages in speculative activities of any nature, and we do not use such investments to hedge our investment positions.
24090_13_ITEM7_P163_S0	Citizens is a holding company and has had minimal operations of its own.
24090_13_ITEM7_P163_S1	Our assets consist of the capital stock of our subsidiaries, cash, fixed income securities, mutual funds and investment real estate.
24090_13_ITEM7_P163_S2	Our cash flows depend primarily upon the availability of statutorily permissible payments, primarily payments under management agreements from our two primary life insurance subsidiaries, CICA and SPLIC.
24090_13_ITEM7_P163_S3	The ability to make payments is limited by applicable laws and regulations of Colorado, CICA's state of domicile, and Louisiana, SPLIC's state of domicile, which subject insurance operations to significant regulatory restrictions.
24090_13_ITEM7_P163_S4	These laws and regulations require, among other things, that these insurance subsidiaries maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company.
24090_13_ITEM7_P164_S0	We historically have not relied upon dividends from subsidiaries for our cash flow needs.
24090_13_ITEM7_P164_S1	However, CICA and SPLIC both dividend available funds from time to time in relation to new acquisition target strategies.
24090_13_ITEM7_P165_S0	CICA has contributed amounts in the form of dividends to Citizens totaling $5.4 million , $6.8 million and $9.3 million in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
24090_13_ITEM7_P166_S0	Additionally, a substantial portion of our international policyholders invest their policy cash dividends and benefits in our Class A common stock through our Stock Investment Plan (the Plan ).
24090_13_ITEM7_P166_S1	Once a policyholder elects to participate in the Plan, their policy benefits can be used to purchase Citizens Class A common stock through the Plan in the open market.
24090_13_ITEM7_P166_S2	In addition, our existing holders of Class A common stock, our employees and our independent consultants are eligible to participate in the Plan.
24090_13_ITEM7_P166_S3	If fewer policyholders elect to participate in the Plan, or if our international premium collections were to decrease as a result of regulatory or marketing impediments, the trading volume of our Class A common stock may decline from its present levels.
24090_13_ITEM7_P167_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
24090_13_ITEM7_P167_S1	Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM7_P167_S2	While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available.
24090_13_ITEM7_P167_S3	Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
24090_13_ITEM7_P168_S0	Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.
24090_13_ITEM7_P169_S0	No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting policies.
24090_13_ITEM7_P170_S0	Our critical accounting policies are as follows:
24090_13_ITEM7_P171_S0	Future policy benefit reserves have been computed by the net level premium method with assumptions as to investment yields, dividends on participating business, mortality and withdrawals based upon our experience.
24090_13_ITEM7_P171_S1	The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of policy liabilities and the increase in future policy benefit reserves.
24090_13_ITEM7_P171_S2	Management's judgments and estimates for future policy benefit reserves provide for possible unfavorable deviation.
24090_13_ITEM7_P172_S0	We continue to use the original assumptions (including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation) in subsequent periods to determine the changes in the liability for future policy benefits (the "lock-in concept ) unless a premium deficiency exists.
24090_13_ITEM7_P172_S1	Management monitors these assumptions and has determined that a premium deficiency did not exist as of December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P172_S2	Management believes that our policy liabilities and increase in future policy benefit reserves as of the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 are based upon assumptions, including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation, that do not warrant revision.
24090_13_ITEM7_P173_S0	Acquisition costs, consisting of commissions and policy issuance, underwriting and agency expenses that relate to and vary with the successful production of new business, are deferred.
24090_13_ITEM7_P173_S1	These deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized primarily over the estimated premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of the annual premium recognized to the total premium revenue anticipated, using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_13_ITEM7_P174_S0	We utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance.
24090_13_ITEM7_P174_S1	The factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period.
24090_13_ITEM7_P174_S2	The factor method ensures that policies that lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation.
24090_13_ITEM7_P174_S3	The factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value, provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors.
24090_13_ITEM7_P175_S0	Inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred, the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_13_ITEM7_P175_S1	Approximately 90.0% of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year excess commissions.
24090_13_ITEM7_P175_S2	The remaining 10.0% are attributed to costs that vary with and are directly related to the successful acquisition of new insurance business.
24090_13_ITEM7_P175_S3	Those costs generally include costs related to the production, underwriting and issuance of new business.
24090_13_ITEM7_P176_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_13_ITEM7_P176_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 30 years.
24090_13_ITEM7_P176_S2	The available premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated.
24090_13_ITEM7_P176_S3	The deferred policy acquisition costs are then evaluated over two methods utilizing reasonable assumptions and two other methods using pessimistic assumptions.
24090_13_ITEM7_P177_S0	The two methods utilizing pessimistic assumptions still support early recoverability of our aggregate deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_13_ITEM7_P178_S0	Management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value.
24090_13_ITEM7_P178_S1	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on capitalized expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business, utilization of the factor method and annual recoverability testing.
24090_13_ITEM7_P179_S0	Cost of Customer Relationships Acquired ("CCRA") is established when we purchase a block of insurance.
24090_13_ITEM7_P179_S1	CCRA is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_13_ITEM7_P180_S0	We utilize various methods to determine the amount of the ending asset balance, including a static model and a dynamic model.
24090_13_ITEM7_P180_S1	Inherent in the amortization of CCRA are certain management judgments about the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_13_ITEM7_P180_S2	The assumptions used are based upon interest, mortality and lapses at the time of purchase.
24090_13_ITEM7_P181_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_13_ITEM7_P181_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next thirty years.
24090_13_ITEM7_P181_S2	The CCRA is then evaluated utilizing reasonable assumptions.
24090_13_ITEM7_P181_S3	Management believes our CCRA and related amortization is recoverable for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .
24090_13_ITEM7_P181_S4	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on estimated future results of the block and our annual recoverability testing.
24090_13_ITEM7_P182_S0	Current accounting guidance requires that goodwill balances be reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event has occurred.
24090_13_ITEM7_P183_S0	A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment on one level below an operating segment.
24090_13_ITEM7_P183_S1	Most of the Company's reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated, are equivalent to the Company's operating segment, as there is no discrete financial information available for the separate components of the segment or all of the components of the segment have similar economic characteristics.
24090_13_ITEM7_P184_S0	The goodwill impairment test follows a multi step process as defined under current accounting guidance.
24090_13_ITEM7_P184_S1	An initial review may be performed whereby the assessment is based upon a qualitative factors before performing the first test step.
24090_13_ITEM7_P185_S0	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
24090_13_ITEM7_P185_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment.
24090_13_ITEM7_P185_S2	In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value.
24090_13_ITEM7_P185_S3	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
24090_13_ITEM7_P186_S0	Management's determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations, peer company price to earnings multiples, the level of the Company's Class A common stock price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit.
24090_13_ITEM7_P186_S1	Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections.
24090_13_ITEM7_P187_S0	The evaluation of securities for impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings.
24090_13_ITEM7_P187_S1	The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition or future prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period.
24090_13_ITEM7_P188_S0	Based upon current accounting guidance, investment securities must be classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading.
24090_13_ITEM7_P188_S1	Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase.
24090_13_ITEM7_P189_S0	The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities.
24090_13_ITEM7_P189_S1	Fixed maturity securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the Company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity.
24090_13_ITEM7_P189_S2	Securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings until realized.
24090_13_ITEM7_P190_S0	The Company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if an OTTI exists pursuant to the accounting guidelines.
24090_13_ITEM7_P190_S1	In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the ability and intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
24090_13_ITEM7_P190_S2	In analyzing an issuer's financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the Federal government or its agencies, by government-sponsored agencies, or whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and reviews of the issuer's financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM7_P191_S0	If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, management must then determine the amount of OTTI to be recognized in earnings.
24090_13_ITEM7_P191_S1	If management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.
24090_13_ITEM7_P191_S2	The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.
24090_13_ITEM7_P191_S3	The amount of OTTI related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_13_ITEM7_P191_S4	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_13_ITEM7_P191_S5	If management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_13_ITEM7_P191_S6	Any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain (as other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold.
24090_13_ITEM7_P192_S0	The Company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions, future market movements, business plan changes, or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time.
24090_13_ITEM7_P193_S0	Premiums on life and accident and health policies are reported as earned when due or, for short duration contracts, over the contract period on a pro rata basis.
24090_13_ITEM7_P193_S1	Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in recognition of profits over the estimated life of the contracts.
24090_13_ITEM7_P193_S2	This matching is accomplished by means of provisions for future benefits and the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_13_ITEM7_P194_S0	Annuities are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest bearing financial instruments.
24090_13_ITEM7_P195_S0	Our primary annuity products do not include fees or other such charges.
24090_13_ITEM7_P196_S0	A deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recorded only if a determination is made that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax treatment on which the deferred tax item depends will be sustained in the event of an audit.
24090_13_ITEM7_P196_S1	These determinations inherently involve management's judgment.
24090_13_ITEM7_P196_S2	In addition, the Company must record a tax valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
24090_13_ITEM7_P196_S3	This valuation allowance is in essence a contra account to the deferred tax asset.
24090_13_ITEM7_P196_S4	Management must determine the portion of the deferred tax asset and resulting tax benefit that may not be realized based upon judgment of expected outcomes.
24090_13_ITEM7_P197_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_13_ITEM7_P197_S1	Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position.
24090_13_ITEM7_P198_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The nature of our business exposes us to market risk relative to our invested assets and policy liabilities.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Market risk is the risk of loss that may occur when changes in interest rates and public equity prices adversely affect the value of our invested assets.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Interest rate risk is our primary market risk exposure.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can affect the fair value of our investments.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio generally increases when interest rates decrease and decreases when interest rates increase.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The following table summarizes net unrealized gains and losses for the periods indicated.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our exposure to interest rate changes results from our significant holdings of fixed maturity investments, policy loans and mortgage loans on real estate, all of which comprised over 87.3% of our cash and investment portfolio as of December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	These investments are mainly exposed to changes in U.S. Treasury rates.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Our fixed maturities investments include U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, U.S. Government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, state and municipal bonds, and corporate bonds.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Approximately 16.9% of the fixed maturities we owned at market value on December 31, 2012 are instruments of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, or are backed by U.S. Government agencies.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	To manage interest risk, we perform periodic projections of asset and liability cash flows to evaluate the potential sensitivity of our investments and liabilities.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We assess interest rate sensitivity on an annual basis with respect to our fixed maturities investments using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward shifts in the prevailing interest rates.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The Company performed an analysis of fair values changes using assumed 100 basis point upward shifts in interest rates, noting that the fair value of our fixed maturity investment portfolio of $798.3 million would decrease approximately $58.1 million to a fair value of $740.2 million upon a 100 basis point increase.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The following table shows the effects on the fair values of our fixed maturity investments based upon these scenarios.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	While the test scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed-income markets, it is a near-term change that illustrates the potential impact of such events.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Due to the composition of our book of insurance business, we believe it is unlikely we would encounter large surrender activity due to an interest rate increase that would force us to dispose of our fixed maturities at a loss.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Our fixed maturity portfolio is exposed to call risk as a significant portion of the current holdings are callable.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P7_S1	A decreasing interest rate environment can result in increased call activity as experienced over the past several years, and an increasing rate environment will likely result in securities being paid at their stated maturity.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P8_S0	There are no fixed maturities or other investments that we classify as trading instruments.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Approximately 75.7% of fixed maturities were held in available-for-sale and 24.3% in held-to-maturity based upon fair value at December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM7A_P8_S2	At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we had no investments in derivative instruments, subprime loans or CDOs (collateralized debt obligations).
24090_13_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Changes in the level or volatility of equity prices affect the value of equity securities we hold as investments.
24090_13_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Our equity investments portfolio represented 5.6% of our total investments at December 31, 2012 , with 95.7% invested in diversified equity and bond mutual funds.
24090_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	Reference is made to the financial statements, the notes thereto, and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm, as listed on the table of contents.
24090_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	All other schedules have been omitted as the required information is inapplicable or the information required is presented in the financial statements or the notes thereto filed elsewhere herein.
24090_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure, among other things, material information relating to our Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to our officers who certify our financial reports and to the other members of our senior management and the Board of Directors.
24090_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and our Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") are responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")).
24090_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based upon an evaluation at the end of the period, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.
24090_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management of our Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
24090_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Management assessed internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").
24090_13_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on this assessment, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.
24090_13_ITEM9A_P3_S1	The report is included in item 9A(d) of this annual report.
24090_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	During 2012, there have been no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that materially affect or are reasonably likely to affect the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.
24090_13_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Citizens, Inc.:
24090_13_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We have audited Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
24090_13_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting .
24090_13_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
24090_13_ITEM9A_P7_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
24090_13_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
24090_13_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
24090_13_ITEM9A_P7_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
24090_13_ITEM9A_P8_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
24090_13_ITEM9A_P8_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
24090_13_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
24090_13_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
24090_13_ITEM9A_P10_S0	In our opinion, Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the COSO criteria.
24090_13_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 of Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries and our report dated March 11, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

24090_13_ITEM15_P1_S0	All other schedules have been omitted because the required information is inapplicable or the information required is presented in the financial statements or the notes thereto filed elsewhere herein.
24090_13_ITEM15_P2_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Citizens, Inc.:
24090_13_ITEM15_P3_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012.

24090_13_ITEM15_P4_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
24090_13_ITEM15_P4_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
24090_13_ITEM15_P5_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
24090_13_ITEM15_P5_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
24090_13_ITEM15_P5_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
24090_13_ITEM15_P6_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
24090_13_ITEM15_P6_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
24090_13_ITEM15_P7_S0	As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in connection with implementing new accounting standards, the Company retrospectively changed its method of accounting for costs associated with issuing or renewing insurance contracts.
24090_13_ITEM15_P8_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 11, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

24090_13_ITEM15_P16_S0	In 2010 , the Company sold a parcel of real estate and issued a mortgage loan for $102,000 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P16_S1	This same loan was foreclosed on and the real estate was transferred to the other long-term investments category in the amount of $101,000 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P17_S0	Supplemental Disclosures of Non-Cash Financing Activities:

24090_13_ITEM15_P20_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
24090_13_ITEM15_P21_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Citizens, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP").
24090_13_ITEM15_P22_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of Citizens, Inc. ("Citizens"), a Colorado corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, CICA Life Insurance Company of America ("CICA"), Citizens National Life Insurance Company ("CNLIC"), Security Plan Life Insurance Company ("SPLIC"), Security Plan Fire Insurance Company ("SPFIC"), Computing Technology, Inc. ("CTI"), and Insurance Investors, Inc. ("III").
24090_13_ITEM15_P22_S1	All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
24090_13_ITEM15_P23_S0	We provide primarily life insurance, as well as a small amount of health insurance policies, through three of our subsidiaries - CICA, SPLIC, and CNLIC.
24090_13_ITEM15_P24_S0	CICA and CNLIC issue ordinary whole-life policies, burial insurance, pre-need policies, and accident and health related policies, throughout the Midwest and southern United States.
24090_13_ITEM15_P24_S1	CICA also issues ordinary whole-life policies to non-U.S. residents.
24090_13_ITEM15_P25_S0	SPLIC offers final expense and home service life insurance in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi and SPFIC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SPLIC, writes a limited amount of property insurance in Louisiana.
24090_13_ITEM15_P26_S0	CTI provides data processing systems and services, as well as furniture and equipment, to the Company.
24090_13_ITEM15_P27_S0	III provides aviation transportation to the Company.
24090_13_ITEM15_P28_S0	Investment securities are classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading.
24090_13_ITEM15_P28_S1	Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase.
24090_13_ITEM15_P29_S0	The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities.
24090_13_ITEM15_P29_S1	Fixed maturity securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the Company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity.
24090_13_ITEM15_P29_S2	Securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings until realized.
24090_13_ITEM15_P30_S0	Fixed maturities consist primarily of bonds classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.
24090_13_ITEM15_P30_S1	The Company does not classify any fixed maturities as trading.
24090_13_ITEM15_P30_S2	Equity securities (including non-redeemable preferred stock) are considered available-for-sale and are reported at fair value.
24090_13_ITEM15_P31_S0	Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of equity securities and fixed maturities held as available-for-sale is shown as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of tax, and is a separate component of comprehensive income.
24090_13_ITEM15_P32_S0	The Company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if an other-than-temporary impairment ("OTTI") exists pursuant to the accounting guidelines.
24090_13_ITEM15_P32_S1	In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the ability and intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
24090_13_ITEM15_P32_S2	In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the Federal government or its agencies, by government-sponsored agencies, or whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and reviews of the issuer s financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM15_P33_S0	If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, management must then determine the amount of OTTI to be recognized in earnings.
24090_13_ITEM15_P33_S1	If management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.
24090_13_ITEM15_P33_S2	The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.
24090_13_ITEM15_P34_S0	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_13_ITEM15_P34_S1	If management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_13_ITEM15_P34_S2	Any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain (as other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold.
24090_13_ITEM15_P35_S0	The Company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions, future market movements, business plan changes, or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time.
24090_13_ITEM15_P36_S0	Mortgage loans on real estate and policy loans are reported at unpaid principal balances.
24090_13_ITEM15_P37_S0	Real estate and other long-term investments consist primarily of land and buildings that are recorded at depreciated cost.
24090_13_ITEM15_P37_S1	If the fair value of the real estate is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized and charged to earnings.
24090_13_ITEM15_P38_S0	Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method.
24090_13_ITEM15_P39_S0	Dividend and interest income is recognized when earned.
24090_13_ITEM15_P39_S1	Realized gains and losses are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold.
24090_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	The Company had cash equivalents and fixed maturities with an aggregate fair value of $10.2 million and $10.5 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, on deposit with various state regulatory authorities to fulfill statutory requirements.
24090_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	Premiums on life policies are recognized as earned when due.
24090_13_ITEM15_P41_S1	Due premiums on the balance sheet are net of allowances.
24090_13_ITEM15_P42_S0	Accident and health policies are recognized as revenue over the contract period on a pro rata basis.
24090_13_ITEM15_P42_S1	Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in the recognition of profits over the estimated lives of the contracts.
24090_13_ITEM15_P42_S2	This matching is accomplished by means of a provision for future policy benefits and the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	Annuity policies, primarily flexible premium fixed annuity products, are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest bearing financial instruments.
24090_13_ITEM15_P43_S1	Premium receipts are not reported as revenue, rather as deposit liabilities to annuity contracts.
24090_13_ITEM15_P43_S2	The annuity products issued do not include fees or other such charges.
24090_13_ITEM15_P44_S0	Acquisition costs, consisting of commissions and policy issuance, underwriting and agent convention expenses that are primarily related to and vary with the successful production of new and renewal business, have been deferred.
24090_13_ITEM15_P44_S1	These deferred amounts, referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC"), are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and amortized to income in a systematic manner, based on related contract revenues or gross profits as appropriate.
24090_13_ITEM15_P45_S0	Traditional life insurance and accident and health insurance acquisition costs are being amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing future policy benefit liabilities.
24090_13_ITEM15_P45_S1	For universal life type contracts and investment contracts that include significant surrender charges or that yield significant revenues from sources other than the investment contract holders' funds, the deferred contract acquisition cost amortization is matched to the recognition of gross profit.
24090_13_ITEM15_P45_S2	The effect on the DAC asset that would result from realization of unrealized gains or losses is recognized with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income in consolidated stockholders' equity.
24090_13_ITEM15_P46_S0	If an internal replacement of insurance or investment contract modification substantially changes a contract as defined in current accounting guidance, then the DAC is written off immediately through income and any new deferrable costs associated with the new replacement are deferred.
24090_13_ITEM15_P46_S1	If a contract modification does not substantially change the contract, the DAC amortization on the original contract will continue and any acquisition costs associated with the related modification are immediately expensed.
24090_13_ITEM15_P47_S0	We utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance.
24090_13_ITEM15_P47_S1	The factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period.
24090_13_ITEM15_P47_S2	The factor method ensures that policies lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation.
24090_13_ITEM15_P47_S3	The factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value, provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors.
24090_13_ITEM15_P48_S0	Inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred, the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_13_ITEM15_P48_S1	Approximately 90% of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year excess commissions.
24090_13_ITEM15_P48_S2	The remaining 10% are attributed to costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new insurance business.
24090_13_ITEM15_P48_S3	Those costs generally include costs related to the production, underwriting and issuance of new business.
24090_13_ITEM15_P49_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_13_ITEM15_P49_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less the benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 30 years.
24090_13_ITEM15_P49_S2	The available premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated.
24090_13_ITEM15_P49_S3	The deferred policy acquisition costs are then evaluated over two methods utilizing reasonable assumptions and two other methods using pessimistic assumptions.
24090_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	Management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value.
24090_13_ITEM15_P50_S1	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on capitalized expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business, utilization of the factor method and annual recoverability testing.
24090_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	The components of deferred acquisition costs from year to year are summarized as follows:
24090_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	Cost of customer relationships acquired ("CCRA") is established when we purchase a block of insurance.
24090_13_ITEM15_P52_S1	CCRA is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	We utilize various methods to determine the amount of the ending asset balance, including a static model and a dynamic model.
24090_13_ITEM15_P53_S1	Inherent in the amortization of CCRA are certain management judgments about the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_13_ITEM15_P53_S2	The assumptions used are based upon interest, mortality and lapses at the time of purchase.
24090_13_ITEM15_P54_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_13_ITEM15_P54_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less the benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next thirty years.
24090_13_ITEM15_P54_S2	The CCRA is then evaluated utilizing reasonable assumptions.
24090_13_ITEM15_P54_S3	Management believes that our CCRA and related amortization is recoverable for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P54_S4	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on estimated future results of the block and our annual recoverability testing.
24090_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	Cost of customer relationships acquired relative to purchased blocks of insurance is summarized as follows:
24090_13_ITEM15_P56_S0	Estimated amortization of cost of customer relationship acquired in each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows.
24090_13_ITEM15_P56_S1	Actual future amortization will differ from these estimates due to variances from estimated future withdrawal assumptions.
24090_13_ITEM15_P57_S0	The value of CCRA in our various acquisitions, which is included in cost of customer relationships acquired in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, was determined based on the present value of future profits discounted at annual rates ranging from 4.5% to 8.5% .
24090_13_ITEM15_P58_S0	Future policy benefit reserves for traditional life insurance and accident and health insurance contract benefits and expenses are computed using a net level premium method, with assumptions as to investment yields, dividends on participating business, mortality and withdrawals based upon our experience, modified as necessary to reflect anticipated trends and to include provisions for possible unfavorable deviations.
24090_13_ITEM15_P59_S0	The accrued account balance for non-traditional life insurance and investment contracts is computed as deposits net of withdrawals made by the contract holder, plus amounts credited based on contract specifications, less contract fees and charges assessed, plus any additional interest.
24090_13_ITEM15_P59_S1	Annuity interest crediting rates range from 3.0% to 5.5% annually.
24090_13_ITEM15_P59_S2	Benefits and expenses are charged against the account balance to recognize costs as incurred over the estimated lives of the contracts.
24090_13_ITEM15_P59_S3	Expenses include interest credited to contract account balances and benefits paid in excess of contract account balances.
24090_13_ITEM15_P60_S0	Unpaid claims on accident and health policies represent the estimated liability for benefit expenses, both reported but not paid and incurred but not reported to the Company.
24090_13_ITEM15_P60_S1	Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated using individual case basis valuations and statistical analyses.
24090_13_ITEM15_P60_S2	Those estimates are subject to the effects of trends in claim severity and frequency.
24090_13_ITEM15_P61_S0	Anticipated investment income is not considered in determining whether a premium deficiency exists with respect to short-duration contracts.
24090_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	Premium deposits accrue interest at rates ranging from 4.0% to 8.25% per annum.
24090_13_ITEM15_P62_S1	The cost of insurance is included in the premium when collected and interest is credited annually to deposit accounts.
24090_13_ITEM15_P63_S0	The development of liabilities for future policy benefits requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding mortality, morbidity, lapse, expense, and investment experience.
24090_13_ITEM15_P63_S1	These estimates are based primarily on historical experience and future expectations of mortality, morbidity, expense, persistency, and investment assumptions.
24090_13_ITEM15_P63_S2	Actual results could differ materially from estimates.
24090_13_ITEM15_P63_S3	We monitor actual experience and revise assumptions as necessary.
24090_13_ITEM15_P64_S0	Goodwill is the difference between the purchase price in a business combination and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, and is not amortized.
24090_13_ITEM15_P64_S1	Other intangible assets include various state insurance licenses, which have been determined to have indefinite useful lives and, therefore, are not amortized.
24090_13_ITEM15_P64_S2	Both goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are subject to annual impairment analyses.
24090_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	The goodwill impairment test uses a two step process as set forth under current accounting guidance.
24090_13_ITEM15_P65_S1	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
24090_13_ITEM15_P65_S2	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment.
24090_13_ITEM15_P65_S3	In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value.
24090_13_ITEM15_P65_S4	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
24090_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	Management's determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations, peer company price to earnings multiples, the level of the Company's Class A common stock price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit.
24090_13_ITEM15_P66_S1	Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections.
24090_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company had goodwill of $12.6 million allocated to the Life Insurance segment and $4.5 million allocated to the Home Service Insurance segment.
24090_13_ITEM15_P67_S1	The Company completes its annual goodwill assessment for the individual reporting units within the Life Insurance segment and Home Service Insurance segment as of December 31 each year.
24090_13_ITEM15_P67_S2	There was no impairment of goodwill in 2012 , 2011 or 2010 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , participating business approximated 60.8% and 59.2% , respectively, of direct life insurance in force.
24090_13_ITEM15_P69_S0	Future policy benefits on participating policies are estimated based on net level premium reserves for death and endowment policy benefits ranging from 3% to 8% , and the cash surrender values described in such contracts.
24090_13_ITEM15_P70_S0	The scaling rate used for the 2012 portfolio ranged between 3.2% up to 4.0% over 3 years and then going up to 5% at 15 years and remaining there for the duration.
24090_13_ITEM15_P71_S0	Earnings and dividends on participating policies are allocated based on policies in force.
24090_13_ITEM15_P72_S0	Policyholder dividends are determined based on the discretion of the Board of Directors of the policy issuing subsidiary.
24090_13_ITEM15_P72_S1	Policyholder dividends are accrued over the premium paying periods of the insurance contract.
24090_13_ITEM15_P73_S0	Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.
24090_13_ITEM15_P73_S1	Diluted earnings per share are computed under the if-converted method for convertible securities and the treasury stock method for warrants, giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock, including options, warrants and convertible/redeemable preferred stock.
24090_13_ITEM15_P73_S2	The basic and diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock are one half the earnings per share of the Class A common stock.
24090_13_ITEM15_P74_S0	During 2011 , the warrants associated with the Series A-1 Preferred Stock were either exercised or expired on July 12, 2011.
24090_13_ITEM15_P74_S1	Shares issued from the exercise of warrants totaled 255,216 , and 1,989 common Class A shares were issued under a cashless provision in the Preferred Stock contract.
24090_13_ITEM15_P74_S2	Additionally, 9,487 shares were issued from the exercise of warrants at various dates in 2011 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P74_S3	During 2012 , the warrants associated with the Series A-2 Preferred Stock were either exercised or expired.
24090_13_ITEM15_P74_S4	Shares issued from the exercise of warrants totaled 113,057 and 13,606 common Class A shares were issued under a cashless provision in the Preferred Stock contract.
24090_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
24090_13_ITEM15_P76_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
24090_13_ITEM15_P76_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered.
24090_13_ITEM15_P77_S0	A deferred tax asset is recorded only if a determination is made that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax treatment on which the deferred tax asset depends will be sustained in the event of an audit.
24090_13_ITEM15_P77_S1	These determinations inherently involve management's judgment.
24090_13_ITEM15_P77_S2	In addition, the Company must record a tax valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
24090_13_ITEM15_P77_S3	This valuation allowance is in essence a contra account to the deferred tax asset.
24090_13_ITEM15_P77_S4	Management must determine the portion of the deferred tax asset and resulting tax benefit that may not be realized based upon judgment of expected outcomes.
24090_13_ITEM15_P78_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_13_ITEM15_P78_S1	Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position.
24090_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
24090_13_ITEM15_P79_S1	Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to thirty years.
24090_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated life of the improvements.
24090_13_ITEM15_P80_S1	The Company has no capital leases.
24090_13_ITEM15_P81_S0	The following is a summary of property and equipment.
24090_13_ITEM15_P82_S0	Reinsurance recoverable includes expected reimbursements for policyholder claim amounts in excess of the Company's retention, as well as profit sharing and experience refund accruals.
24090_13_ITEM15_P82_S1	Reinsurance recoverable is reduced for estimated uncollectible amounts, if any.
24090_13_ITEM15_P83_S0	Reinsurance premiums, losses and adjustment expenses are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts.
24090_13_ITEM15_P83_S1	The cost of reinsurance related to long duration contracts is accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies.
24090_13_ITEM15_P83_S2	The cost of reinsurance related to short duration contracts is accounted for over the coverage period.
24090_13_ITEM15_P83_S3	Profit-sharing and similar adjustable provisions are accrued based on the experience of the underlying policies.
24090_13_ITEM15_P84_S0	The Company considers as cash equivalents all securities whose duration does not exceed 90 days at the date of acquisition.
24090_13_ITEM15_P85_S0	The Company considers investments maturing within one year at acquisition as short-term.
24090_13_ITEM15_P85_S1	These securities are carried at amortized cost, which approximates market value.
24090_13_ITEM15_P86_S0	Depreciation on most property and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis using estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years.
24090_13_ITEM15_P86_S1	Building improvements are depreciated over the estimated lives of thirty years.
24090_13_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Company recorded a reduction of approximately $0.4 million in commission expense for the year ended 2012 due to balances that were held pending validation that are no longer considered payable.
24090_13_ITEM15_P88_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
24090_13_ITEM15_P88_S1	Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
24090_13_ITEM15_P89_S0	Reserving assumptions are reviewed to ensure our original assumptions at the time of policy issuance that related to interest, mortality, withdrawals, and settlement expenses are based upon management s best judgment.
24090_13_ITEM15_P89_S1	In 2012 and 2011 , the Company revised assumptions used in the development of reserve and DAC balances to reflect the assumed decline in the long-term investment rate.
24090_13_ITEM15_P89_S2	The adjustment resulted in an increase to reserves of approximately $0.2 million and $0.8 million and a decrease in the DAC asset of approximately $0.1 million and $1.4 million , respectively.
24090_13_ITEM15_P90_S0	Certain amounts presented in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
24090_13_ITEM15_P91_S0	In June 2011, the FASB amended ASU No. 2011-05 on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements to improve the comparability, consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items that are recorded in other comprehensive income.
24090_13_ITEM15_P91_S1	The new accounting guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either (1) a continuous statement of comprehensive income or (2) two separate but consecutive statements.
24090_13_ITEM15_P91_S2	The provisions of this new guidance was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
24090_13_ITEM15_P92_S0	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
24090_13_ITEM15_P93_S0	Effective January 1, 2012 , the Company retrospectively adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board s ("FASB") guidance modifying the definition of the types of costs incurred by insurance entities that can be capitalized in the acquisition of new and renewal contracts.
24090_13_ITEM15_P93_S1	The guidance specified that the costs must be based on successful efforts.
24090_13_ITEM15_P93_S2	The guidance also specifies that advertising costs should be included as deferred acquisition costs only when the direct-response advertising accounting criteria are met.
24090_13_ITEM15_P93_S3	The retrospective effect of the change in our deferred acquisition costs decreased stockholders equity balance as of January 1, 2010 by $6.9 million .
24090_13_ITEM15_P94_S0	The following table provides the balance sheet and income statement accounts that were impacted by the change in accounting principle.
24090_13_ITEM15_P95_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( ASU 2013-02 ), which requires enhanced reporting of such amounts either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes to the financial statements.
24090_13_ITEM15_P95_S1	Under ASU 2013-02, the type of reclassification out of AOCI, as defined under current GAAP, will dictate whether the disclosure must provide the effect of the reclassification on the respective financial statement line items or whether cross-referencing to other disclosures that provide additional detail about the reclassification will be required.
24090_13_ITEM15_P95_S2	The amendments in ASU 2013-02 are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012.
24090_13_ITEM15_P95_S3	We will adopt the requirements of ASU 2013-02 beginning with our financial statements for the quarterly period ending March 31, 2013, and will include the enhanced disclosures in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
24090_13_ITEM15_P96_S0	Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs.
24090_13_ITEM15_P96_S1	ASU 2011-04 amends Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, to converge the fair value measurement guidance in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ).
24090_13_ITEM15_P96_S2	ASU 2011-04 clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement requirements, changes certain principles in Topic 820 and requires additional fair value disclosures.
24090_13_ITEM15_P97_S0	2011-04 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, and did not have any impact on the Company s financial statements.
24090_13_ITEM15_P98_S0	The Affordable Care Act, as passed by the U.S. Congress in the first quarter of 2010.
24090_13_ITEM15_P98_S1	The Company has considered its medical and dental plans provided for employees and agents.
24090_13_ITEM15_P98_S2	While the Company will incur additional costs associated with the implementation of this Act, it does not believe these costs or ongoing costs associated with this Act will have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.
24090_13_ITEM15_P99_S0	The Company does not provide a separate prescription drug plan to its retirees.
24090_13_ITEM15_P99_S1	In addition, the Company does not sell any medical insurance or prescription drug coverage.
24090_13_ITEM15_P99_S2	However, the Company does sell dental insurance but believes the impact of this Act is immaterial to these products.
24090_13_ITEM15_P99_S3	The Company will continue to assess the information contained in this Act as additional guidance becomes available and as additional implications are understood or clarified.
24090_13_ITEM15_P100_S0	In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( the Financial Reform Act ) was enacted.
24090_13_ITEM15_P100_S1	The Financial Reform act includes a provision to establish a Federal Insurance Office with the primary purpose of collecting information to better understand insurance issues at the federal level and to monitor the extent to which traditional underserved communities and consumers, minorities and low and moderate income persons have access to affordable insurance products.
24090_13_ITEM15_P100_S2	The Financial Reform Act also contains provisions affecting financial institutions, credit rating agencies and other commercial and consumer businesses.
24090_13_ITEM15_P101_S0	The Company invests primarily in fixed maturity securities, which totaled 82.7% of total investments and cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P101_S1	Holdings in high quality fixed maturity securities rated A or higher by Standard Poor's, Inc. totaled 80.4% of investment holdings in this category, reflecting the conservative investment philosophy of the Company.
24090_13_ITEM15_P102_S0	The cost, gross unrealized gains and losses and fair value of investments in fixed maturities and equity securities, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , are as follows.
24090_13_ITEM15_P103_S0	For investments of available-for-sale fixed maturities that have unrealized losses as of December 31, 2012 , the cost, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer and fair value are as follows.
24090_13_ITEM15_P104_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , there are 3 equity securities that had unrealized losses for greater than 12 months.
24090_13_ITEM15_P105_S0	The largest group of available-for-sale fixed maturities in a gross unrealized loss position for more than 12 months is primarily the municipal bonds acquired in the acquisition of SPLIC in 2004, and under purchase GAAP accounting, have a higher cost basis than historical cost.
24090_13_ITEM15_P105_S1	These premiums are being amortized to net investment income.
24090_13_ITEM15_P105_S2	Management has completed its assessment of other-than-temporary impairment of these securities.
24090_13_ITEM15_P105_S3	Based on our evaluation of the credit worthiness of the issuers and because we do not intend to sell the investments, nor is it likely that we would be required to sell these investments, before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, none of the unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporary.
24090_13_ITEM15_P106_S0	We monitor all debt and equity securities on an on-going basis relative to changes in credit ratings, market prices, earnings trends and financial performance, in addition to specific region or industry reviews.
24090_13_ITEM15_P106_S1	Our impairment review, in accordance with current guidance, is performed by the Company at each reporting date and management uses its best judgment to decide if impairment is other-than-temporary.
24090_13_ITEM15_P106_S2	We determine other-than-temporary impairment by reviewing relevant evidence related to the specific security issuer, as well as our intent to sell the security or whether we more likely than not will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery.
24090_13_ITEM15_P107_S0	All securities with a market price below par were segregated and reviewed as of December 31, 2012 based upon the items above for impairment.
24090_13_ITEM15_P108_S0	For investments of available-for-sale fixed maturities and equity securities that have unrealized losses as of December 31, 2011 , the cost, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer and fair value are as follows.
24090_13_ITEM15_P109_S0	The amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturities at December 31, 2012 by contractual maturity are shown below.
24090_13_ITEM15_P110_S0	Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
24090_13_ITEM15_P111_S0	The securities not due at a single maturity date include mortgage-backed obligations of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises and corporate securities.
24090_13_ITEM15_P112_S0	The Company had no investments in any one entity, excluding U.S. Government agencies, which exceeded 10% of stockholders' equity at December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P112_S1	In addition, there were no investments that were non-income producing for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P113_S0	Major categories of net investment income are summarized as follows:
24090_13_ITEM15_P114_S0	Proceeds and gross realized gains and losses from sales of fixed maturities available-for-sale for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 are summarized as follows:
24090_13_ITEM15_P115_S0	Certain securities were sold during 2012 from a tax planning perspective and due to statutory reporting considerations related to non-rated securities.
24090_13_ITEM15_P116_S0	In 2010 , the Company sold available-for-sale bonds to capture realized gains and reinvest in higher yielding securities of the same quality based upon market changes.
24090_13_ITEM15_P117_S0	There were no securities sold from the held-to-maturity portfolio in 2012 , 2011 or 2010 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P118_S0	Proceeds and gross realized gains and losses from sales of equity securities for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 are summarized as follows:
24090_13_ITEM15_P119_S0	In 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , the Company sold holdings of equity mutual funds that were previously impaired, generating realized capital gains for financial reporting purposes of $0.6 million , $1.3 million and $6.4 million , respectively, but realized losses for tax purposes.
24090_13_ITEM15_P119_S1	The tax losses offset current year tax gains and were carried back to recover taxes paid on gains in prior years.
24090_13_ITEM15_P120_S0	Realized investment gains (losses) are as follows:
24090_13_ITEM15_P121_S0	We recorded an OTTI write-down in 2012 of $1,319,000 related to one coal powered energy issuer debt security holding which has a maturity date in 2017.
24090_13_ITEM15_P121_S1	We also recorded impairments in 2011 of $70,000 related to a bond issuer that declared bankruptcy in 2011 and $561,000 related to an investment property that was acquired as part of the Ozark acquisition in 2009 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P121_S2	A current appraisal reflected a declining value of this Arkansas office building from the fair value at acquisition.
24090_13_ITEM15_P122_S0	The Company had realized gains of $246,000 from calls of held-to-maturity fixed maturities in 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P123_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
24090_13_ITEM15_P123_S1	We hold fixed maturity and equity securities that are carried at fair value.
24090_13_ITEM15_P124_S0	Fair value measurements are generally based upon observable and unobservable inputs.
24090_13_ITEM15_P124_S1	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.
24090_13_ITEM15_P124_S2	We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
24090_13_ITEM15_P125_S0	All assets and liabilities carried at fair value are required to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
24090_13_ITEM15_P126_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
24090_13_ITEM15_P127_S0	Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose inputs or whose significant value drivers are observable.
24090_13_ITEM15_P128_S0	Level 3 - Instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable.
24090_13_ITEM15_P129_S0	Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as U.S. Treasury securities, publicly traded mutual fund investments and individual stocks.
24090_13_ITEM15_P130_S0	Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued by independent pricing services or broker quotes.
24090_13_ITEM15_P130_S1	These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various inputs, such as interest rates, credit spreads and foreign exchange rates for the underlying financial instruments.
24090_13_ITEM15_P131_S0	Financial instruments in this category primarily include corporate fixed maturity securities, U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise securities, municipal securities and certain mortgage and asset-backed securities.
24090_13_ITEM15_P132_S0	Level 3 is comprised of financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on non-binding broker prices utilizing significant inputs not based on, or corroborated by, readily available market information.
24090_13_ITEM15_P132_S1	This category consists of two private placement mortgage-backed securities where we cannot corroborate the significant valuation inputs with market observable data.
24090_13_ITEM15_P133_S0	The following table sets forth our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the date indicated.
24090_13_ITEM15_P134_S0	At December 31, 2012 , the fixed maturities, valued using a third-party pricing source, totaled $590.2 million for Level 2 assets and comprised 89.7% of total reported fair value.
24090_13_ITEM15_P134_S1	Fair values for Level 3 assets are based upon unadjusted broker quotes that are non-binding.
24090_13_ITEM15_P135_S0	The Level 1 and Level 2 valuations are reviewed and validated quarterly through random testing by comparisons to separate pricing models, other third party pricing services, and back tested to recent trades.
24090_13_ITEM15_P135_S1	In addition, we obtain information relative to the third party pricing models and review model parameters for reasonableness.
24090_13_ITEM15_P135_S2	For the period ended December 31, 2012 , there were no material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine fair values, and no broker or third party prices were changed from the values received.
24090_13_ITEM15_P136_S0	Fair values of these securities are based upon quoted market price and are classified as Level 1 assets.
24090_13_ITEM15_P137_S0	Fair value of our warrants are based upon industry standard models that consider various observable inputs and are classified as Level 2.
24090_13_ITEM15_P138_S0	The following table presents additional information about fixed maturity securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and for which we have utilized significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs to determine fair value:
24090_13_ITEM15_P139_S0	We review the fair value hierarchy classifications each reporting period.
24090_13_ITEM15_P140_S0	Changes in the observability of the valuation attributes may result in a reclassification of certain financial assets.
24090_13_ITEM15_P140_S1	Such reclassifications, if any, are reported as transfers in and out of Level 3 at the beginning fair value for the reporting period in which the changes occur.
24090_13_ITEM15_P141_S0	Estimates of fair values are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market prices and information about the financial instrument.
24090_13_ITEM15_P141_S1	The estimated fair values of financial instruments presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company might realize in actual market transactions.
24090_13_ITEM15_P141_S2	The carrying amount and fair value for the financial assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at each year-end were as follows:
24090_13_ITEM15_P142_S0	Fair values for fixed income securities, which are characterized as Level 2 assets in the fair value hierarchy, are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar securities.
24090_13_ITEM15_P142_S1	In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other assumptions, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.
24090_13_ITEM15_P143_S0	Mortgage loans are secured principally by residential properties and commercial properties.
24090_13_ITEM15_P143_S1	Weighted average interest rates for these loans were approximately 6.6% and 6.6% per year, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, with maturities ranging from P2Y to P29Y years.
24090_13_ITEM15_P143_S2	Management estimated the fair value using an annual interest rate of 6.25% at December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P143_S3	Our mortgage loans are considered Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_13_ITEM15_P144_S0	Policy loans have a weighted average annual interest rate of 7.7% as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, and have no specified maturity dates.
24090_13_ITEM15_P145_S0	These loans typically carry an interest rate that is tied to the crediting rate applied to the related policy and contract reserves.
24090_13_ITEM15_P146_S0	Policy loans are an integral part of the life insurance policies that we have in force and cannot be valued separately and are not marketable.
24090_13_ITEM15_P146_S1	Therefore, the fair value approximates the carrying value and policy loans are considered Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_13_ITEM15_P147_S0	The fair value of short-term investments approximate carrying value due to their short-term nature.
24090_13_ITEM15_P147_S1	Our short-term investments are considered Level 2 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_13_ITEM15_P148_S0	The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximate carrying value and are characterized as Level 1 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_13_ITEM15_P149_S0	The fair value of the Company's liabilities under annuity contract policies, which are considered Level 3 assets, was estimated at December 31, 2012 using discounted cash flows based upon a swap rate curve with interest rates ranging from 0.1% to 3.8% based upon swap rates adjusted for various risk adjustments.
24090_13_ITEM15_P149_S1	The fair value of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in the overall management of interest rate risk, which seeks to minimize exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment maturities with amounts due under insurance contracts.
24090_13_ITEM15_P150_S0	Various assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit reserves of life insurance include the following: a) valuation interest rates from 4% to 9% per year; b) mortality assumptions are from the 1955 to 1960, 1965 to 1970, 1975 to 1980 and 2001 Select and Ultimate mortality tables; and c) withdrawals are based primarily on actual historical termination rates.
24090_13_ITEM15_P151_S0	The following table presents information on changes in the liability for life, accident and health and property policy and contract claims for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P152_S0	The Company experienced favorable development of $0.7 million in 2012 , primarily related to SPLIC.
24090_13_ITEM15_P152_S1	We have performed a review and have refined our incurred but not reported calculation in 2011 and 2012.
24090_13_ITEM15_P152_S2	This method is anticipated to provide us with a more refined view of the claims development process.
24090_13_ITEM15_P153_S0	The favorable development in 2011 of $1,600,000 was primarily related the release of higher claim reserves in SPLIC due to longer claim reporting lags following Hurricane s Katrina and Rita and the relocation of insured lives.
24090_13_ITEM15_P153_S1	The claims related to these events have stabilized and the higher claim reserves are no longer deemed necessary.
24090_13_ITEM15_P154_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company reinsures portions of certain policies that we underwrite to limit disproportionate risks.
24090_13_ITEM15_P154_S1	During 2012 and 2011 , we retained varying amounts of individual insurance up to a maximum retention of $100,000 on any life.
24090_13_ITEM15_P154_S2	The Company also reinsures 100% of our accidental death benefit rider coverage.
24090_13_ITEM15_P154_S3	Catastrophe reinsurance is in place for our property policies.
24090_13_ITEM15_P154_S4	In 2012 and 2011 , this reinsurance provided $10,000,000 of coverage above a $500,000 deductible.
24090_13_ITEM15_P155_S0	Our health insurance policies are substantially all reinsured on a 100% coinsurance basis.
24090_13_ITEM15_P155_S1	We remain contingently liable to the extent that the reinsuring companies cannot meet their obligations under these reinsurance treaties.
24090_13_ITEM15_P156_S0	Our amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and reserves ceded to reinsurers.
24090_13_ITEM15_P156_S1	We obtain reinsurance from multiple reinsurers, and we monitor concentration as well as financial strength ratings of our principal reinsurers.
24090_13_ITEM15_P156_S2	The ratings by A.M. Best Company range from B+ (Good) to A+ (Superior).
24090_13_ITEM15_P157_S0	To protect our position, we have established and funded a trust to cover the contingent liabilities related to accident and health reinsurance ceded to Puritan Life Insurance Company of America, which represents $4.9 million of the $9.7 million of reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P158_S0	Assumed and ceded life reinsurance activity as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 is summarized as follows:
24090_13_ITEM15_P159_S0	The Company's reinsurance recoveries on ceded reinsurance were $9.7 million in 2012 and $9.6 million in 2011 .

24090_13_ITEM15_P160_S2	The annual premium was approximately $1.0 million in 2012 , and $1.1 million in 2011 and 2010 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P161_S0	The two classes of our common stock are equal in all respects, except (a) each Class A share receives twice the cash dividends paid on a per share basis to the Class B common stock; and (b) the Class B common stock elects a simple majority of the Board of Directors of Citizens and the Class A common stock elects the remaining directors.
24090_13_ITEM15_P162_S0	The table below shows the combined total of all of our insurance subsidiaries' capital and surplus and net income (loss) for life insurance operations and property insurance operations, although these amounts are not all available as dividends to Citizens, Inc., because only CICA is directly owned by Citizens, Inc.
24090_13_ITEM15_P162_S1	All other subsidiaries are owned by CICA.
24090_13_ITEM15_P163_S0	Generally, the net assets of the insurance subsidiaries available for transfer to their immediate parent are limited to the greater of the subsidiary net gain from operations during the preceding year or 10% of the subsidiary net statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_13_ITEM15_P163_S1	Under these practices, total surplus at December 31, 2012 was $50.7 million and net gain from operations was $2.9 million for CICA.
24090_13_ITEM15_P163_S2	Based upon statutory net gain from operations and surplus of CICA as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 , a dividend of approximately $5.1 million could be paid to the Company without prior regulatory approval in 2013 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P163_S3	Payments of dividends in excess of such amounts would generally require approval by regulatory authorities.
24090_13_ITEM15_P164_S0	CICA, CNLIC, SPLIC and SPFIC have calculated their risk based capital ("RBC") in accordance with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' Model Rule and the RBC rules as adopted by their respective states of domicile.
24090_13_ITEM15_P164_S1	All insurance subsidiaries exceeded RBC minimum levels at December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P165_S0	In July 2004, the Company completed a private placement of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series A-1 Preferred ) to four unaffiliated institutional investors.
24090_13_ITEM15_P165_S1	We also issued to the investors warrants to purchase shares of our Class A common stock, at an exercise price of $6.95 per share, and unit warrants to purchase Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series A-2 Preferred ).
24090_13_ITEM15_P165_S2	The conversion, exercise and redemption prices, along with the number of shares and warrants, were adjusted for stock dividends paid on December 31, 2004 and on December 30, 2005.
24090_13_ITEM15_P166_S0	All outstanding warrants were exercised in 2011 and 2012 and none were remaining as of December 31, 2012.
24090_13_ITEM15_P167_S0	The fair value of the warrants was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and was classified as a liability on the balance sheet in the amount of $0.5 million at December 31, 2011 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P167_S1	The change in fair value of warrants was reported as a component of revenue in the income statement.
24090_13_ITEM15_P167_S2	The change in fair value of warrants for the year ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 caused an increase in revenues of $0.5 million $1.1 million and $0.2 million , respectively.
24090_13_ITEM15_P168_S0	We are a defendant in a lawsuit filed on August 6, 1999 , in the Texas District Court, Austin, Texas, now styled Delia Bolanos Andrade, et al., Plaintiffs, v. Citizens Insurance Company of America, et al., Defendants in which a class was originally certified by the trial court and reversed by the Texas Supreme Court in 2007 with an order to the trial court to conduct further proceedings consistent with its ruling.
24090_13_ITEM15_P168_S1	The underlying lawsuit alleged that certain life insurance policies CICA made available to non-U.S. residents, when combined with a policy feature that allowed certain cash benefits to be assigned to two non-U.S. trusts for the purpose of accumulating ownership of our Class A common stock, along with allowing the policyholders to make additional contributions to the trusts, were actually offers and sales of securities that occurred in Texas by unregistered dealers in violation of the Texas securities laws.
24090_13_ITEM15_P168_S2	The remedy sought was rescission and return of the insurance premium payments.
24090_13_ITEM15_P168_S3	On December 9, 2009 , the trial court denied the recertification of the class after conducting additional proceedings in accordance with the Texas Supreme Court's ruling.
24090_13_ITEM15_P168_S4	The remaining plaintiffs must now proceed individually, and not as a class, if they intend to pursue their claims against us.
24090_13_ITEM15_P168_S5	Since the December 9, 2009 trial court ruling, no individual cases have been further pursued by the plaintiffs.
24090_13_ITEM15_P168_S6	The probability of the plaintiffs further pursuing their cases individually is unknown.
24090_13_ITEM15_P168_S7	An estimate of any possible loss or range of losses cannot be made at this time in regard to individuals pursuing claims.
24090_13_ITEM15_P168_S8	However, should the plaintiffs further pursue their claims individually, we intend to vigorously defend any proceedings.
24090_13_ITEM15_P169_S0	SPFIC is vigorously defending a lawsuit filed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and currently pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.
24090_13_ITEM15_P169_S1	This matter was filed by the Louisiana Attorney General against SPFIC and every other homeowner insurer doing business in the State of Louisiana, on behalf of the State of Louisiana, as assignee, and on behalf of certain Road Home fund recipients.
24090_13_ITEM15_P169_S2	Although this lawsuit was originally filed as a class action, the Louisiana Attorney General moved to dismiss the class in 2011 and the motion was granted.
24090_13_ITEM15_P169_S3	In this matter the State alleged that the insurers failed to pay all damages owed under their policies.
24090_13_ITEM15_P169_S4	The claims currently pending in this matter are for breach of contract and for declaratory relief on the alleged underpayment of claims by the insurers.
24090_13_ITEM15_P169_S5	All other claims, including extra-contractual claims, have been dismissed.
24090_13_ITEM15_P170_S0	The District Court has issued a case management order requiring the State to produce specific detail by property supporting its breach of contract allegations.
24090_13_ITEM15_P170_S1	Additionally, the case management order requires the State to deliver a settlement proposal to SPFIC and the other defendant insurance companies.
24090_13_ITEM15_P170_S2	Since, there are many potential individual claims at issue in this matter, each will require individual analysis and a number of which may be subject to individual defenses, including release, accord and satisfaction, prescription, waiver, and estoppel.
24090_13_ITEM15_P170_S3	There has been no discovery in connection with this matter.
24090_13_ITEM15_P171_S0	SPFIC believes its claims practices in connection with Katrina homeowners claims were sound and in accordance with industry standards and state law.
24090_13_ITEM15_P171_S1	There remain significant questions of Louisiana law that have yet to be decided.
24090_13_ITEM15_P171_S2	SPFIC intends to vigorously defend all claims asserted in any remaining proceedings.
24090_13_ITEM15_P171_S3	Therefore, in SPFIC's judgment given the issues discussed above, an estimate of probable loss cannot be made at this time.
24090_13_ITEM15_P172_S0	SPFIC is vigorously defending a number of matters in various stages of development filed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in addition to the Road Home Litigation, including a number of individual lawsuits, which are immaterial to the Company's financial statements.
24090_13_ITEM15_P173_S0	At this time we cannot estimate any possible loss or range of losses in regard to either Delia Bolanos Andrade, et al., Plaintiffs, v. Citizens Insurance Company of America, et al., Defendants or the Road Home Litigation.
24090_13_ITEM15_P174_S0	We are defending these claims vigorously.
24090_13_ITEM15_P174_S1	However, in doing so, we continue to incur significant defense costs, including attorneys' fees, other direct litigation costs and the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_13_ITEM15_P174_S2	If we suffer an adverse judgment as a result of either of these claims, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_13_ITEM15_P175_S0	We have the following lease commitments as of December 31, 2012 with the payments due by the periods indicated below.
24090_13_ITEM15_P176_S0	Operating lease expense was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , and $0.5 million for the same periods ended 2011 and 2010 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P177_S0	The Company has three reportable segments: Life Insurance, Home Service Insurance, and Other Non-Insurance Enterprises.
24090_13_ITEM15_P177_S1	The accounting policies of the segments are in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are the same as those described in the summary of significant account policies.
24090_13_ITEM15_P178_S0	We evaluate profit and loss performance based on U.S. GAAP net income before federal income taxes for our three reportable segments.
24090_13_ITEM15_P179_S0	The Company has no reportable differences between segments and consolidated operations.
24090_13_ITEM15_P180_S0	The table below summarizes assets by segment.
24090_13_ITEM15_P181_S0	Major categories of earned premiums are summarized as follows:
24090_13_ITEM15_P182_S0	The following table sets forth the Company's annual total of earned premiums from geographic area for the years indicated:
24090_13_ITEM15_P183_S0	Our federal income tax expense was $1.5 million , $2.8 million and $3.7 million in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
24090_13_ITEM15_P183_S1	This represents effective tax rates of 25.0% , 25.1% and 20.0% , respectively.
24090_13_ITEM15_P183_S2	The Company previously had a valuation allowance related to OTTI writedowns on stocks and stock mutual funds in 2008.
24090_13_ITEM15_P183_S3	Due to the sale of these mutual funds in 2009 and 2010, the valuation allowance was released in its entirety in 2009 and 2010.
24090_13_ITEM15_P183_S4	Part of this valuation allowance was released to other comprehensive income ("OCI") in 2009 due to the increase in fair value of mutual funds and stocks still owned.
24090_13_ITEM15_P183_S5	As the stocks and mutual funds have been disposed of since 2009, this valuation allowance has been released as reductions of tax expense.
24090_13_ITEM15_P183_S6	During 2010, 2011 and 2012 $1.9 million , $570,000 and $188,000 has been released as a reduction of tax expense, respectively.
24090_13_ITEM15_P184_S0	The table below summarizes the changes in the valuation allowance.
24090_13_ITEM15_P185_S0	A reconciliation of federal income tax expense computed by applying the federal income tax rate of 35% in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 to income (loss) before federal income tax expense is as follows:
24090_13_ITEM15_P186_S0	Income tax expense (benefit) consists of:
24090_13_ITEM15_P187_S0	Deferred tax expense is comprised of $1,971,000 deferred tax benefit and $188,000 tax benefit released from OCI.
24090_13_ITEM15_P188_S0	The components of deferred federal income taxes are as follows:
24090_13_ITEM15_P189_S0	A summary of the changes in the components of deferred federal and state income taxes is as follows:
24090_13_ITEM15_P190_S0	The Company and our subsidiaries had net operating losses at December 31, 2012 available to offset future taxable income of approximately $8,851,000 , expiring at various times through 2029.
24090_13_ITEM15_P190_S1	A portion of the net operating loss carryforward is subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
24090_13_ITEM15_P191_S0	At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we determined that as a result of our historical income, projected future income, tax planning strategies, and the nature of the items from which the deferred tax assets are derived, other than assets for which OTTI was recorded, it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized.
24090_13_ITEM15_P192_S0	The Company has sufficient unrealized gains in its available-for-sale portfolio so as not to need a valuation allowance for OTTI writedowns.
24090_13_ITEM15_P193_S0	The Company and our subsidiaries had no capital loss carry-forwards at December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P194_S0	No new additions are expected to be made to this account.
24090_13_ITEM15_P194_S1	Federal income taxes will become payable thereon at the then current tax rate (a) when and if distributions to shareholders, other than stock dividends and other limited exceptions, are made in excess of the accumulated previously taxed income; or (b) when a company ceases to be a life insurance company as defined by the Internal Revenue Code and such termination is not due to another life insurance company acquiring its assets in a nontaxable transaction.
24090_13_ITEM15_P195_S0	We do not anticipate any transactions that would cause any part of this amount to become taxable.
24090_13_ITEM15_P195_S1	However, should the balance at December 31, 2012 become taxable, the tax computed at present rates would be approximately $1,152,000 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P196_S0	There are no uncertain tax positions for the year ended December 31, 2012 ; therefore, we did not accrue any interest or penalties related to these items.
24090_13_ITEM15_P197_S0	The Company's Federal income tax return is filed on a consolidated basis with the following entities:
24090_13_ITEM15_P198_S0	CICA Life Insurance Company of America Security Plan Life Insurance Company Security Plan Fire Insurance Company Computing Technology, Inc.
24090_13_ITEM15_P199_S0	The method of allocation among companies is subject to a written tax sharing agreement, approved by the Board of Directors, whereby allocation is made primarily on a separate return basis with current credit for any net operating losses or other items utilized in the consolidated tax return.
24090_13_ITEM15_P200_S0	Intercompany tax balances are settled quarterly.
24090_13_ITEM15_P201_S0	The Company and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various U.S. states.
24090_13_ITEM15_P201_S1	Most of our subsidiaries are not subject to examination by U.S. tax authorities for years prior to 2009.
24090_13_ITEM15_P201_S2	Some of our subsidiaries have open tax years going back as far as 1996 due to net operating loss carry-forwards.
24090_13_ITEM15_P202_S0	The changes in the components of other comprehensive income (loss) are reported net of the effects of income taxes of 35% in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , as indicated below.
24090_13_ITEM15_P203_S0	The Company sponsors a defined contribution profit-sharing plan.
24090_13_ITEM15_P203_S1	Employees with one year of service can participate.
24090_13_ITEM15_P203_S2	Contributions are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and are subject to a tiered vesting schedule.
24090_13_ITEM15_P203_S3	Employer contributions to the plan were $0.8 million in 2012 and $1.0 million in 2011 and 2010 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P203_S4	The plan does not permit employee contributions.
24090_13_ITEM15_P204_S0	The Company is primarily self-insured for employee health benefits.
24090_13_ITEM15_P204_S1	The Company records its self-insurance liability based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.
24090_13_ITEM15_P204_S2	There is stop-loss coverage for amounts in excess of $100,000 per individual per year.
24090_13_ITEM15_P204_S3	If more claims are made than were estimated or if the costs of actual claims increase beyond what was anticipated, reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional accruals may be required in future periods.
24090_13_ITEM15_P205_S0	The Company sponsors the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan (the "Plan"), which is administered by an independent third party.
24090_13_ITEM15_P205_S1	The Plan is a means for new and existing investors in our Class A Common Stock to purchase and sell shares at market prices.
24090_13_ITEM15_P205_S2	Each share purchased through the Plan is registered in the name of the investing shareholder.
24090_13_ITEM15_P205_S3	The Company offers the Plan to our policyholders for automatic investment of policy benefits, including policyholder dividends and annual endowment benefits.
24090_13_ITEM15_P205_S4	We do not have possession of, or control over, any amounts invested through the Plan.
24090_13_ITEM15_P206_S0	Citizens, Inc. purchased Class A common shares during 2012 and 2011 that were held by subsidiaries at market value as of the transaction dates, which approximated $0.6 million and $1.2 million , respectively.
24090_13_ITEM15_P206_S1	These transactions were eliminated for financial reporting purposes in accordance with consolidation accounting, but generated a tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 totaling approximately $0.2 million and $0.4 million .
24090_13_ITEM15_P207_S0	In 2012 and 2011 , CICA made a return of capital of $5.4 million and $6.8 million , respectively, to Citizens, Inc. and SPLIC paid a dividend to CICA in the amount of $2.3 million and $0.6 million , respectively.
24090_13_ITEM15_P208_S0	The following table contains selected unaudited financial data for each quarter.
24090_13_ITEM15_P209_S0	We have evaluated for subsequent events as defined by the accounting guidance through the date of financial statement issuance.

24090_13_ITEM15_P337_S1	For the year, our consolidated life insurance premiums increased 5% , driven largely by strong persistency and continued expansion in our international business, where endowment products continue to be our strongest selling product.
24090_13_ITEM15_P337_S2	In addition, we have continued to see modest growth in our home service segment with premiums increasing 1.5% year over year.
24090_13_ITEM15_P338_S0	Riley added, We were able to increase invested assets by 7.3% to $901 million from $839 million at year-end 2011 due to premium growth.
24090_13_ITEM15_P338_S1	As a result, we reported investment income growth for the fourth quarter and full year as the higher balances offset the lower yields available in this market.
24090_13_ITEM15_P338_S2	With our conservative investment philosophy, our portfolio is currently yielding just over 3.8% compared with 3.9% in 2011 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P339_S0	Further, book value per share of Class A common stock increased 6% to $5.25 at December 31, 2012 , compared with $4.97 at year-end 2011 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P339_S1	The 2012 increase was due primarily to fluctuations in the market values of bonds and stocks in our portfolio, Riley said.
24090_13_ITEM15_P340_S0	Riley commented, We recognized investment losses in the quarter ending December 31, 2012 related to a $1.3 million other-than-temporary impairment of one coal producing energy bond issuer.
24090_13_ITEM15_P340_S1	Including that impairment, net realized gains on investments for the full year were lower than the prior year, although we sold previously impaired stock mutual fund holdings in both years.
24090_13_ITEM15_P340_S2	The sale of those securities allowed us to recover taxes paid on prior year gains and to achieve consolidated return tax savings.
24090_13_ITEM15_P340_S3	No warrants were outstanding at December 31, 2012 , as they were exercised or expired during the year.
24090_13_ITEM15_P341_S0	Turning to operating income, Riley noted, Income for the year was reduced by the pressures of the current low interest rate environment on investment income and reserves.
24090_13_ITEM15_P341_S1	The assumption regarding investment income is a lead driver in the development of reserves and endowment products, which are comprising a significant amount of our new sales, and require higher reserve balances to be established earlier in the product duration.
24090_13_ITEM15_P342_S0	Non-GAAP Financial Measures - The table above reconciles Net Income to Operating Income.
24090_13_ITEM15_P342_S1	Operating Income is a "Non-GAAP" financial measure that is widely used in our industry to evaluate the performance of underwriting operations.
24090_13_ITEM15_P342_S2	Operating Income excludes the Fair Value Changes of Warrants and the after-tax net effects of Net Realized Investment Gains and Losses.
24090_13_ITEM15_P342_S3	We believe it presents a useful view of the performance of our insurance operations.
24090_13_ITEM15_P342_S4	While we believe disclosure of certain Non-GAAP information is informative, you should not consider this information without also considering the information we present in accordance with GAAP.
24090_13_ITEM15_P343_S0	t Life Insurance - Our Life Insurance segment primarily issues endowment and ordinary whole life insurance in U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents and domestically across the United States.
24090_13_ITEM15_P344_S0	Premiums Life insurance premium revenues increased for the fourth quarter and full year of 2012 , due to higher international first year and renewal premiums, which have experienced strong persistency as this block of business ages.
24090_13_ITEM15_P344_S1	Improved new business performance in 2012 reflected strong sales from Colombia, Ecuador, Taiwan, and Venezuela.
24090_13_ITEM15_P344_S2	Endowment sales represented $14.3 million or 81.9% of new first year premium as of December 31, 2012 compared to $12.3 million and 69.4% for the year in 2011.
24090_13_ITEM15_P345_S0	In addition, most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision, which allows policyholders to utilize cash value of a policy to pay premiums and keep policies in force.
24090_13_ITEM15_P345_S1	The policy loan asset balance in the life insurance segment increased 10% year over year.
24090_13_ITEM15_P346_S0	Benefits and expenses Life insurance benefits and expenses increased more rapidly than premiums for the fourth quarter and full year of 2012 primarily because endowment products require accumulation of higher reserve balances on the front end when compared to whole life products.
24090_13_ITEM15_P346_S1	In addition, death claims increased by 5.3% reflecting more reported claims in 2012 compared to 2011, but was within expected levels.
24090_13_ITEM15_P346_S2	General expenses decreased in 2012 by 7.5% as we continued to promote efficiencies in our operations.
24090_13_ITEM15_P346_S3	Amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased by 9.5% compared to 2011as the asset balance increases.
24090_13_ITEM15_P347_S0	t Home Service - Our Home Service Insurance segment provides pre-need and final expense ordinary life insurance and annuities to middle and lower income individuals primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_13_ITEM15_P347_S1	Our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through funeral homes and a home service marketing distribution system.
24090_13_ITEM15_P348_S0	Premiums Home service premiums increased 1.5% over 2011 as this business continues to perform steadily with modest year over year growth.
24090_13_ITEM15_P349_S0	Benefits and expenses Home service benefits and expenses increased by 1.7% for the fourth quarter, but were essentially unchanged for the full year of 2012 compared to 2011.
24090_13_ITEM15_P349_S1	Death benefits were up 19.8% and 9.7% for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2012 from 2011 due to more claims reported in the current year.
24090_13_ITEM15_P349_S2	In addition, property claims increased 16.3% to $2.3 million in 2012 compared to 2011 due to Hurricane Isaac, which impacted Louisiana policyholders in the later part of 2012.
24090_13_ITEM15_P349_S3	Both 2012 and 2011 results are negatively impacted by an increase in amortization of deferred acquisition expenses resulting from assumption changes for new issued business relating to the anticipated lower long-term portfolio yield and high lapses experienced in both years.
24090_13_ITEM15_P350_S0	Our home service policyholders have been negatively impacted by the current economic conditions, including continued high levels of unemployment throughout the country.
24090_13_ITEM15_P351_S0	t Invested assets Total invested assets including cash and cash equivalents grew 9.7% in 2012 , reflecting additional premium income from new and renewal business over the past year.
24090_13_ITEM15_P352_S0	Equity security holdings increased to $53.7 million at year-end 2012 from $46.1 million at year-end 2011 as bond proceeds of approximately $7.6 million were reinvested into bond mutual funds to gain additional yield via shorter duration opportunities.
24090_13_ITEM15_P353_S0	Cash and cash equivalents represented 5.9% of total cash, cash equivalents and invested assets at year-end 2012 , up from 3.8% in 2011 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P353_S1	These balances fluctuate based upon the timing of premium receipts and bond maturities and investment into fixed maturity investments.
24090_13_ITEM15_P354_S0	t Investment income Net investment income increased 7.7% for the quarter ended December 31, 2012 , and 5.4% for the full-year.
24090_13_ITEM15_P354_S1	The gains were primarily due to higher average investment balances offsetting the lower yields on invested assets.
24090_13_ITEM15_P354_S2	The policy loan asset balance increased by 10.0% in 2012 , resulting in an increase in policy loan income, a component of investment income.
24090_13_ITEM15_P355_S0	Duration - Significant calls by issuers of holdings in our fixed maturity securities portfolio, driven by the sustained low interest rate environment, have led to the reinvestment of proceeds at lower yields as market rates have declined.
24090_13_ITEM15_P355_S1	During 2012 , the Company continued significant investments of bonds in state municipals and corporate utility sector issuers with credit ratings ranging from A A to BBB.
24090_13_ITEM15_P356_S0	The Company began increasing investments in investment-grade corporate, municipal bonds and shorter duration bond mutual funds in 2011 to obtain higher yields.
24090_13_ITEM15_P356_S1	The average maturity of the fixed income bond portfolio was 12.0 years with an estimated effective maturity of 6.7 years as of December 31, 2012 .
24090_13_ITEM15_P357_S0	t Realized gains We recorded an other-than-temporary impairment for the three months and year ended December 31, 2012 totaling $1.3 million related to one issuer of bonds in the coal producing energy sector.
24090_13_ITEM15_P357_S1	In 2012 and 2011 , the Company sold equity mutual funds, which were previously impaired, and other securities for realized gains of $0.6 million and $1.3 million for tax considerations, respectively.
24090_13_ITEM15_P358_S0	On Tuesday, March 12, Citizens will host a conference call to discuss operating results at 10 a.m.
24090_13_ITEM15_P358_S1	The conference call will be hosted by Rick D. Riley, Vice Chairman and President, Kay Osbourn, Chief Financial Officer, and other members of the Company s management team.

24090_13_ITEM15_P359_S0	Citizens, Inc. is a financial services company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CIA.
24090_13_ITEM15_P359_S1	The Company utilizes a three-pronged strategy for growth based upon worldwide sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated whole life cash value insurance policies, life insurance product sales in the U.S. and the acquisition of other U.S. based life insurance companies.

24090_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	Citizens, Inc. ( Citizens ) is an insurance holding company serving the life insurance needs of individuals in the United States since 1969 and internationally since 1975.
24090_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	Through our insurance subsidiaries, we pursue a strategy of offering traditional insurance products in niche markets where we believe we are able to achieve competitive advantages.
24090_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	We had approximately $1.2 billion of assets at December 31, 2013 and approximately $4.6 billion of insurance in force.
24090_14_ITEM1_P0_S3	Our core insurance operations include issuing and servicing:
24090_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	final expense and limited liability property policies to middle and lower income households in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas through employee and independent agents in our home service distribution channel.
24090_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	We were formed in 1969 by our Chairman, Harold E. Riley.
24090_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	Prior to our formation, Mr. Riley had many years of experience in the international and domestic life insurance business.
24090_14_ITEM1_P2_S2	Our Company has experienced growth through acquisitions in the domestic market and through market expansion in the international market.
24090_14_ITEM1_P2_S3	We seek to capitalize on the experience of our management team in marketing and operations as we strive to generate bottom line return using knowledge of our niche markets and our well-established distribution channels.
24090_14_ITEM1_P2_S4	We believe our underwriting processes, policy terms, pricing practices and proprietary administrative systems enable us to be competitive in our current markets, while protecting our shareholders and serving our policyholders.
24090_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our business has grown, both internationally and domestically, in recent years.
24090_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	Revenues rose from $188.1 million in 2009 to $213.6 million in 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM1_P3_S2	During the five years ended December 31, 2013 , our assets grew from $916.6 million to $1.2 billion .
24090_14_ITEM1_P3_S3	Total stockholders' equity increased from $209.1 million at December 31, 2009 to $245.8 million at December 31, 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	"Selected Financial Data" in this Report.
24090_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	The following pages describe the operations of our three business segments: Life Insurance, Home Service and Other Non-Insurance Enterprises.
24090_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	Revenues derived from any single customer did not exceed 10% of consolidated revenues in any of the last three years.
24090_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our Life Insurance segment issues ordinary whole life insurance domestically and in U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents.
24090_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	These contracts are designed to provide a fixed amount of insurance coverage over the life of the insured.
24090_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	Additionally, endowment contracts are issued by the Company, which are principally accumulation contracts that incorporate an element of life insurance protection.
24090_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	For the majority of our business, we retain only the first $100,000 of risk on any one life, reinsuring the remainder of the risk.
24090_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	We operate this segment through our subsidiaries: CICA Life Insurance Company of America ("CICA") and Citizens National Life Insurance Company ("CNLIC").
24090_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	We focus our sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies to high net worth, high income residents in Latin America and the Pacific Rim.
24090_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	We have successfully participated in the foreign marketplace since 1975, and we continue to seek opportunities for expansion of our foreign operations.
24090_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	We believe positive attributes of our international insurance business include:
24090_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	persistency experience and mortality rates that are comparable to our U.S. policies.
24090_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	We have implemented several policies and procedures to reduce the risks of asset and premium loss relating to our international business.
24090_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	Approvals for policy issuance are made in our Austin, Texas office and policies are issued and delivered to our independent consultants, who deliver the policies to the insureds.
24090_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	We have no offices, employees or assets outside of the United States.
24090_14_ITEM1_P10_S3	Insurance policy applications and premium payments are submitted by the independent consultants or customers to us, and we review the applications in our home offices in Austin, Texas.
24090_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	Premiums are paid in U.S. Dollars through a U.S. financial institution by check, wire or credit card.
24090_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	The policies we issue contain limitations on benefits for certain causes of death, such as homicide and careless driving.
24090_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	We have also developed disciplined underwriting criteria, which include medical reviews of applicants as well as background and reference checks.
24090_14_ITEM1_P12_S2	In addition, we have a claims policy that requires investigation of substantially all death claims.
24090_14_ITEM1_P12_S3	Furthermore, we perform background reviews and reference checks of prospective marketing firms and consultants.
24090_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	Independent marketing firms and consultants specialize in marketing life insurance products and generally have several years of insurance marketing experience.
24090_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	We maintain standard contracts with the independent marketing firms pursuant to which they provide recruitment, training and supervision of their managers and associates in the service and placement of our products; however, all associates of these firms also contract directly with us as independent contractors and receive their compensation directly from us.
24090_14_ITEM1_P13_S2	Accordingly, should an arrangement between any independent marketing firm and us be terminated for any reason, we believe we would continue with the existing marketing arrangements with the associates of these firms without a material loss of sales.
24090_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our standard agreement with independent marketing firms and consultants provides they are independent contractors responsible for their own operation expenses, and that they are the representative of the prospective insured.
24090_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	In addition, the marketing firms guarantee any debts of their associates to us.
24090_14_ITEM1_P14_S2	The marketing firms receive commissions on all new and renewal policies serviced or placed by them or their associates.
24090_14_ITEM1_P14_S3	All of these contracts provide that the independent marketing firms and consultants are aware of and responsible for compliance with local laws.
24090_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	We offer several ordinary whole life insurance and endowment products designed to meet the needs of our non-U.S. policyowners.
24090_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	These policies have been structured to provide:
24090_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	lifetime income guarantees for an insured or for surviving beneficiaries.
24090_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our international products have living benefit features.
24090_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	Every policy contains guaranteed cash values and is participating (i.e., provides for cash dividends as apportioned by the board of directors).
24090_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	Once a policyowner pays the annual premium and the policy is issued, the owner becomes entitled to a cash dividend as well as an annual guaranteed endowment, if elected.
24090_14_ITEM1_P17_S3	The policyowner has several options with regard to the dividend and annual guaranteed endowments, including the right to assign policy values to the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan, registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), and administered in the United States by our unaffiliated transfer agent.
24090_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	The life insurance business is highly competitive.
24090_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	We compete with a large number of stock and mutual life companies internationally and domestically, as well as with financial institutions that offer insurance products.
24090_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	There are more than 1,000 life insurance companies in the United States, some of which also provide insurance to foreign residents.
24090_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	We face competition primarily from companies formed and operated in the country in which the insureds reside, from companies that operate in the same manner as we do and from companies that are foreign to the countries in which policies are sold, but issue insurance policies denominated in the local currency of those countries.
24090_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	A substantial number of companies may be deemed to have a competitive advantage over us due to their significantly greater financial resources, histories of successful operations and larger marketing forces.
24090_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	However, we believe that our experience, combined with our product portfolio features, allows us to compete effectively in pursuing new business.
24090_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	Because premiums on our international policies are paid in U.S. Dollars drawn on U.S. financial institutions, and we pay claims and benefits in U.S. Dollars, we provide a product that is different from the products offered by foreign-domiciled companies.
24090_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	Our international policies are usually acquired by individuals with significant net worth and earnings that place them in the top income brackets of their respective countries.
24090_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	The policies sold by our foreign competitors are generally offered broadly and are priced using the mortality of the entire population of the geographic region.
24090_14_ITEM1_P22_S3	Our mortality charges are therefore typically lower, which provides a competitive advantage.
24090_14_ITEM1_P22_S4	Additionally, the assets backing the reserves for our foreign competitors' policies must be substantially invested in their respective countries and, therefore, are exposed to the inflationary risks and social or economic crises that have been more common in these foreign countries.
24090_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	The majority of our inforce business results from blocks of business of insurance companies we have acquired over the past 15 years.
24090_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our acquisition transition strategy focuses on the introduction of our cash accumulation ordinary whole life products to independent marketing consultants associated with companies we have acquired, while continuing to service the needs of acquired policyholders.
24090_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	In the Mountain West, Midwest and the southern United States, we seek to serve middle income households through the sale of cash accumulation ordinary whole life insurance products.
24090_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	Our distribution strategy is through marketing consultants, comprised primarily of part-time, second-career sales associates (such as teachers, coaches, community leaders and others) in rural and urban areas.
24090_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	Over the past few years, new product sales have been modest while existing policies have been running off at a greater pace compressing the block of insurance in force.
24090_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our domestic life insurance products focus primarily on living needs and provide benefits focused toward accumulating money for the policyowner.
24090_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	The features of our domestic life insurance products include:
24090_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	an option to waive premium payments in the event of disability.
24090_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our life insurance products are principally designed to address the insured's concern about outliving his or her monthly income, while at the same time providing death benefits.
24090_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	The primary purpose of our product portfolio is to help the insured create capital for needs such as retirement income, children's higher education funds, business opportunities, emergencies and health care needs.
24090_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	The U.S. life insurance industry is a mature industry that, in recent years, has experienced little to no growth.
24090_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	Competition is intense because the life insurance industry is consolidating, with larger, more efficient and more effective organizations emerging from consolidation.
24090_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	Many domestic life insurance companies have significantly greater financial, marketing forces and other resources, longer business histories and more diversified lines of insurance products than we do.
24090_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	We also face competition from companies marketing in person as well as with direct mail and Internet sales campaigns.
24090_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	Although we may be at a competitive disadvantage to these entities, we believe our premium rates and policy features are generally competitive with those of other life insurance companies selling similar types of ordinary whole life insurance.
24090_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our Home Service segment operates in this market through our subsidiaries Security Plan Life Insurance Company ("SPLIC") and Security Plan Fire Insurance Company ("SPFIC"), and focuses on the life insurance needs of the middle and lower income markets, primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	independent agents to sell policies, collect premiums and service policyholders.
24090_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	To a lesser extent, our Home Service segment sells limited-liability, named peril property policies covering dwelling and contents.
24090_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our home service insurance products consist primarily of small face amount ordinary whole life and pre-need policies, which are designed to fund final expenses for the insured, primarily consisting of funeral and burial costs.
24090_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	The average life insurance policy face amount issued was approximately $6,800 in 2013 ; therefore, the underwriting performed on these applications is limited.
24090_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	Our property coverages are limited to $30,000 maximum coverage on any one dwelling and contents, while content-only coverage and dwelling-only coverage is limited to $20,000 .
24090_14_ITEM1_P33_S3	We face competition in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas from other companies specializing in home service distribution of insurance.
24090_14_ITEM1_P33_S4	We seek to compete based upon our emphasis on personal service to our customers.
24090_14_ITEM1_P33_S5	We intend to continue premium growth within this segment via direct sales and acquisitions.
24090_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	Other Non-insurance Enterprises includes Computing Technology, Inc., which provides data processing services to the Company, and Insurance Investors, Inc., which provides aviation transportation to the Company.
24090_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	This segment also includes the results of Citizens, Inc., the parent Company.
24090_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our administrative operations principally serve our life insurance segment and are conducted primarily at our executive offices in Austin, Texas through approximately 120 administrative, operating and underwriting personnel.
24090_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	Our Home Service operations are conducted to a large degree from our district offices in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, as well as our support center in Donaldsonville, Louisiana through approximately 65 operations personnel.
24090_14_ITEM1_P36_S2	At our executive offices, we also perform policy design, marketing oversight, underwriting, accounting and reporting, customer service, administration and investing activities.
24090_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our senior management has significant experience in insurance company application system design and implementation.
24090_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	Since the mid-1960's, our senior management has been leading development of evolving insurance applications.
24090_14_ITEM1_P37_S2	We have a single integrated system for our entire Company, which is a centrally-controlled, mainframe-based administrative system.
24090_14_ITEM1_P37_S3	Functions of our administrative system include policy set up, administration, billing and collections, commission calculation, valuation, automated internal audit functions, storage backup, image management and other related functions.
24090_14_ITEM1_P37_S4	Each company we acquire is ultimately converted onto our administrative system.
24090_14_ITEM1_P37_S5	This system has been in place for many years, and we believe it is a significant asset to us.
24090_14_ITEM1_P37_S6	We update our administrative system on an ongoing basis.
24090_14_ITEM1_P37_S7	This system is also capable of significant expansion without substantial capital outlay or increase in staff.
24090_14_ITEM1_P37_S8	Therefore, we believe we can achieve additional growth without costly administrative system expenditures, delays, failures or the addition of substantial staffing.
24090_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our U.S. insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations.
24090_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	State insurance laws establish supervisory agencies with broad regulatory authority to regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of each state in which they are licensed.
24090_14_ITEM1_P38_S2	In addition, U.S. laws, such as the USA Patriot Act of 2001, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("the Dodd-Frank Act"), are examples of U.S. regulations that affect our business.
24090_14_ITEM1_P38_S3	We are subject to comprehensive regulations under the USA Patriot Act with respect to money laundering, as well as federal regulations regarding privacy and confidentiality.
24090_14_ITEM1_P38_S4	Our insurance products and thus our businesses also are affected by U.S. federal, state and local tax laws.
24090_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act focuses on financial reform and may result in significant changes to the regulation of institutions operating in the financial services industry, including the Company.
24090_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	Legislative or regulatory requirements imposed by or promulgated in connection with this Act may make it more expensive for the Company to conduct its business, may have a material adverse effect on the overall business climate and could materially affect the profitability of the results of operations and financial condition of financial institutions.
24090_14_ITEM1_P39_S2	The Company is uncertain as to all of the impacts this legislation will have and cannot provide assurance it will not adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1_P39_S3	In general, government regulation at the federal level may increase and may result in unpredictable consequences for the Company.
24090_14_ITEM1_P39_S4	In addition, other federal laws and regulations apply to us in areas such as pension regulations, privacy, tort reform and taxation.
24090_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	The purpose of the laws and regulations that affect our insurance business is primarily to protect our insureds and not our stockholders.
24090_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations.
24090_14_ITEM1_P40_S2	In addition, insurance regulatory authorities (including state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general) periodically make inquiries and regularly conduct examinations regarding compliance by us and our subsidiaries with insurance, and other laws and regulations regarding the conduct of our insurance businesses.
24090_14_ITEM1_P40_S3	We cooperate with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action when warranted.
24090_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are collectively licensed to transact business in 32 states.
24090_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	We have insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the states of Colorado, Louisiana and Texas.
24090_14_ITEM1_P41_S2	Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are licensed and regulated in all U.S. jurisdictions in which they conduct insurance business.
24090_14_ITEM1_P41_S3	The extent of this regulation varies, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations based upon the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) model rules governing the financial condition of insurers, including standards of solvency, types and concentration of investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, credit for reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy, and the business conduct of insurers, including marketing and sales practices and claims handling.
24090_14_ITEM1_P41_S4	In addition, statutes and regulations usually require the licensing of insurers and their agents, the approval of policy forms and related materials and the approval of rates for certain types of insurance products.
24090_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	All U.S. jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries conduct insurance business have enacted legislation that requires each U.S. insurance company in a holding company system, except captive insurance companies, to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its jurisdiction of domicile and to furnish that regulatory authority financial and other information concerning the operations of, and the interrelationships and transactions among, companies within its holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system.
24090_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	These laws and regulations also regulate transactions between insurance companies and their parents and affiliates.
24090_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	Generally, these laws and regulations require that all transactions within a holding company system between an insurer and its affiliates be fair and reasonable and that the insurer's statutory capital and surplus following any transaction with an affiliate be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.
24090_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	Statutory surplus is the excess of admitted assets over the sum of statutory liabilities and capital.
24090_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	For certain types of agreements and transactions between an insurer and its affiliates, these laws and regulations require prior notification to, and non-disapproval or approval by, the insurance regulatory authority of the insurer's jurisdiction of domicile.
24090_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	The payment of dividends or other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by the insurance laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile.
24090_14_ITEM1_P44_S1	The laws and regulations of some of these jurisdictions also prohibit an insurer from declaring or paying a dividend except out of its earned surplus or require the insurer to obtain regulatory approval before it may do so.
24090_14_ITEM1_P44_S2	In addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employee or other services) if they determine such payment could be adverse to policyholders or insurance contract holders of the subsidiary.
24090_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled require that a controlling party obtain the approval of the insurance commissioner of the insurance company's jurisdiction of domicile prior to acquiring control of the insurer and may delay, deter or prevent a transaction our shareholders might consider desirable.
24090_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	Risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements are imposed on life and property and casualty insurance companies.
24090_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	The NAIC has established minimum capital requirements in the form of RBC.
24090_14_ITEM1_P46_S2	RBC factors the type of business written by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company's business to develop a minimum level of capital called "authorized control level risk-based capital" and compares this level to adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves.
24090_14_ITEM1_P46_S3	Should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk-based capital fall below 200%, a series of actions by the affected company would begin.
24090_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	Government actions in response to the recent financial crisis and market volatility could significantly impact our current regulations.
24090_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	As part of a comprehensive reform of financial services regulation known as the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress established an office within the federal government to collect information about the insurance industry, recommend standards, and represent the United States in dealing with foreign insurance regulators.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investing in our Company involves certain risks.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Set forth below are certain risks with respect to our Company.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Readers should carefully review these risks, together with the other information contained in this report.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties we have described in this report are not the only ones we face.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem not material, may also adversely affect our business.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Any of the risks discussed in this report or that are presently unknown or not material, if they were to actually occur, could result in a significant adverse impact on our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	References in the risk factors below to "we," "us," "our," "Citizens" and like terms relate to Citizens, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statement basis, unless specifically identified otherwise.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We operate our subsidiaries as separate and distinct entities with respect to corporate formalities.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	A substantial amount of our revenue comes from foreign residents and is subject to risks associated with foreign insurance laws, political instability and asset transfer restrictions.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	A substantial part of our insurance policy sales are from foreign countries, primarily those in Latin America and the Pacific Rim.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	There is a risk that we may lose a significant portion of these sales should adverse events occur in these countries.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We seek to address this risk by, among other things, not accepting insurance applications outside of the U.S., maintaining all of our assets in the U.S. and requiring policy premiums be paid to us in U.S. Dollars drawn on U.S. financial institutions.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Accordingly, we have never qualified to do business in any foreign country and have never submitted our insurance policies issued to foreign residents for approval by any foreign or domestic insurance regulatory agency.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We sell our policies to foreign residents using foreign independent marketing firms and independent consultants, and we rely on those persons to comply with applicable laws in marketing our insurance products.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The government of a foreign country could determine its residents may not buy life insurance from us unless we became qualified to do business in that country or unless our policies purchased by its residents receive prior approval from its insurance regulators.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Also, new laws or regulations could be implemented or new applications of existing laws or regulations could occur, which could result in the cessation of marketing activities by our independent marketing firms and consultants.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	From time to time we have become aware of new foreign laws, regulations or new interpretations of foreign laws or regulations that may have an adverse effect on the marketing efforts of our foreign independent marketing firms and consultants.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We cannot assure you any of these laws, regulations, or application of them by foreign regulatory authorities will not have an adverse effect on the marketing efforts of our independent marketing firms and consultants and, in turn, on our revenues.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Further, there is no assurance we would be able to qualify to do business in any foreign country or that its insurance regulatory authorities would approve our policies if we decided to submit our insurance policies for approval.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We could also face sanctions, including fines and penalties, if a country's authorities determined any failure to qualify or otherwise comply with its laws was willful or ongoing.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Any of the foregoing could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Additionally, we do not determine whether our independent consultants are required to be licensed to sell insurance in the countries in which they market our policies.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P6_S6	If our independent consultants were not in compliance with applicable laws, including licensing laws, they could be required to cease operations, which would reduce our revenues.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P6_S7	We have not obtained any advice of counsel in any foreign jurisdictions with respect to these matters.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P6_S8	We are unable to quantify the effect of foreign regulation on our business if regulation were to be imposed on us, but we believe we could expend substantial amounts of time and incur substantial expense in complying with any foreign regulation, and we may decide to withdraw from or avoid a market if foreign regulation were imposed.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Additionally, if economic or political crises were to occur in any of the countries where our foreign policyowners reside, our revenues could be adversely affected.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Currently, Venezuela is experiencing civil unrest with demonstrations against endemic crime, corruption and soaring inflation.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Businesses are remaining closed as safety concerns are an issue.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Venezuela contributed 22.6% of direct premiums for the year ended December 31, 2013.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We cannot confidently predict what impact we might see relative to the current unrest in this country but it could significantly impact our business.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Also, currency control laws, regulations and decrees in foreign countries, if implemented, could materially adversely affect our revenues by imposing restrictions on asset transfers outside of a country where our insureds reside.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	There can be no assurance that such situations will not occur and that our revenues, results of operations and financial condition will not be materially, adversely affected if they do occur.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The majority of our foreign policyholders choose to invest their policy dividends or other cash benefits in our Class A common stock through the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan (the"Plan").
24090_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If a securities regulatory authority were to deem the Plan's operation contrary to applicable securities laws, we risk facing fines and penalties and cease and desist orders which would create a reduction in the amount of Class A common stock purchased on the open market through the Plan.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The purpose of the Plan is to provide a convenient and economical means for new investors to make an initial investment in our Class A common stock and for existing investors to purchase additional shares of our Class A common stock.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The Plan is administered by a registered transfer agent independent of us.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The offer and sale of our Class A common stock through the Plan is not registered under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Most all of our foreign policyholders participate in the Plan and choose to invest dividends paid on their insurance policies in our Class A common stock pursuant to the Plan.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We have not obtained any advice of counsel in any foreign jurisdiction as to whether such participation by foreign residents in the Plan is subject to foreign securities laws or regulations or whether our independent consultants in these jurisdictions are subject to licensing requirements in connection with foreign policyholder participation in the Plan.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P14_S5	If a foreign securities regulatory authority were to determine the offer and sale of our Class A common stock under the Plan were contrary to applicable laws and regulations of its jurisdiction, we could be faced with cease and desist orders, fines and penalties, or reduced participation in the Plan by our foreign policyholders.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P14_S6	This also could materially reduce the amount of our Class A common stock purchased and sold in the open market under the Plan, as historically a significant volume of shares have been purchased under the Plan through issuance of policy cash benefits assigned to the Plan.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P14_S7	We could also be faced with private disputes relating to the Plan, including the possibility of securities law claims within the United States.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P14_S8	In the absence of countervailing considerations, we would expect to defend any such claims and we could incur significant defense costs, including not only attorneys' fees and other direct litigation costs, but also the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P14_S9	This could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The previous registration statement covering the Plan was not declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933 and sales under the Plan may not have fully complied with an exemption from registration under that Act.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	As a result, security holders who purchased shares of Class A common stock may have a right to rescind their purchases or other damages.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In 2001, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") covering the sale of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to a predecessor to the Plan.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	On December 18, 2006, the registration statement was amended to increase the number of shares registered and to reflect other amendments to the Plan.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	On December 18, 2009, we filed a further amendment to the registration statement.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The registration statement and amendments treated the Plan and its predecessors as a dividend or interest reinvestment plan and, accordingly, the registration statements on Form S-3 were filed in a manner so that they would be deemed effective upon filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission").
24090_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Upon further analysis and consideration in connection with the preparation of a further amendment to the registration statement, on December 17, 2012 we determined that the Plan may not meet the criteria of a "dividend or interest reinvestment plan" as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act, and that previous sales may not have been exempt from registration under the Securities Act.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Accordingly, we did not believe we could file an amendment to the registration statement on Form S-3 that would be effective upon filing with the Commission.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	As a result, as of the close of business on December 18, 2012, we suspended operation of the Plan with respect to the purchase of Class A common stock.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	On December 21, 2012, we filed with the Commission a new Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 415 on form S-3 with respect to the Plan (the "New Registration Statement"), which was declared effective by the Commission on January 14, 2013.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	If and to the extent participants in the Plan were sold shares of Class A common stock that were not effectively registered under the Securities Act, or exempt from such registration, prior to the time the New Registration Statement was declared effective such participants could have certain remedies available to them, including claims for rescission and damages.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In the 12 months prior to December 19, 2012, a total of approximately 1,544,250 shares of Class A common stock were purchased in the open market under the Plan for participants in the Plan for an aggregate of approximately $15,210,000, or an average of $9.85 per share.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In addition, the Commission could commence an enforcement action against us seeking injunctive or other relief and civil damages.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Should a significant number of these purchasers bring claims for rescission or damages, or should the Commission commence an enforcement action, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and reputation and our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We face financial and capital market risks in our operations.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	As an insurance holding company with significant investment exposure, we face material financial and capital markets risk in our operations.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Due to the low interest rate environment over the past three years, we experienced significant call activity on our fixed income portfolio which has decreased our investment yields compared to prior years.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Also, we recorded other-than-temporary impairments ("OTTI") in the past several years due to credit related market declines.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In addition, the significant increase in worldwide economic instability and unemployment rates could result in decreased persistency of our insurance policies in force, as well as reduced new insurance policy sales, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Economic uncertainty has recently been exacerbated by the increased potential for default by one or more European sovereign debt issuers, the potential partial or complete dissolution of the Eurozone and its common currency and the negative impact of such events on global financial institutions and capital markets generally.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Actions or inactions of European governments may impact these actual or perceived risks.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In the recent past, one rating agency downgraded the U.S.'s long-term debt credit rating from AAA.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Future actions or inactions of the United States government, including a shutdown of the federal government, could increase the actual or perceived risk that the U.S. may not ultimately pay its obligations when due and may disrupt financial markets.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Changes in market interest rates may significantly affect our profitability.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Some of our products, principally traditional whole life insurance with annuity riders, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our "spread," or the difference between the amounts we are required to pay under our contracts to policyholders and the rate of return we are able to earn on our investments intended to support obligations under the contracts.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our spread is a key component of our net income.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured, prepaid, been sold, or called at lower yields, reducing our investment margin.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our fixed income bond portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk as a significant portion of the portfolio is callable.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Lowering interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in investment margins on some of our products.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	However, our ability to lower these rates could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates, and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Our expectation of future spreads is an important component in amortization of deferred acquisition costs and significantly lower spreads may result in increasing amortization, thereby reducing net income for the period.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our investment portfolio is subject to various risks that may result in realized investment losses.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	In particular, decreases in the fair value of fixed maturities may significantly reduce the value of our investments, and as a result, our financial condition may suffer.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations under these securities could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in the recognition of investment losses.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the bonds included in our portfolio and by other factors that may result in the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In particular, at December 31, 2013 , fixed maturities represented $833.0 million or 88.8% of our total investments of $938.2 million .
24090_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The fair value of fixed maturities and the related investment income fluctuates depending on general economic and market conditions.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The fair value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us will generally increase or decrease in line with changes in market interest rates.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	An investment has prepayment risk when there is a risk that the timing of cash flows resulting from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The impact of value fluctuations affects our consolidated financial statements, as a large portion of our fixed maturities are classified as available-for-sale, with changes in fair value reflected in our stockholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss).
24090_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	No similar adjustment is made for liabilities to reflect a change in interest rates.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Therefore, interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect our stockholders' equity, total comprehensive income and/or cash flows.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	For mortgage-backed securities, credit risk exists if mortgagees default on the underlying mortgages.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	our fixed maturities are subject to credit risk.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	If any of the issuers of our fixed maturities suffer financial setbacks, the ratings on the fixed maturities could fall (with a concurrent fall in fair value) and, in a worst case scenario, the issuer could default on its financial obligations.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P37_S2	If the issuer defaults, we could have realized losses associated with the impairment of the securities.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	A substantial portion of our investment portfolio is concentrated in U.S. Government sponsored corporations and agencies.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	At December 31, 2013 , we had investments with a carrying value of $65.9 million ( 7.9% of our total invested assets) in U.S. Government sponsored corporations and agencies, including the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie") and the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie").
24090_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Both Freddie and Fannie are currently in conservatorship, certain of their operations are being combined and the federal government is considering proposals to phase them out, or allow them to continue as private corporations, among other things.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	If they are wound down, it is not clear how investments sponsored by them might be affected; however, the direct and indirect impact on our investment portfolio could be material and could be adverse.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities may be realized or result in future impairments, resulting in a reduction in our net income.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and are, therefore, excluded from our net income.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Our total gross unrealized losses on our available-for-sale securities portfolio at December 31, 2013 were $13.1 million .
24090_14_ITEM1A_P41_S3	The accumulated change in estimated fair value of these securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is realized upon sale of the security or in the event that the decline in estimated fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary and an impairment charge to earnings is taken.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Realized losses or impairments may have a material adverse effect on our net income in a particular quarterly or annual period.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims and we may be required to establish additional reserves, which in turn may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We maintain reserves to cover our estimated exposure for claims relating to our issued insurance policies.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Reserves, whether calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") or statutory accounting practices prescribed by various state insurance regulators, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections, of what we expect claims will be based on mortality assumptions that are determined by various regulatory authorities.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Many reserve assumptions are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P43_S3	In addition, when we acquire other domestic life insurance companies, our assessment of the adequacy of acquired policy liabilities is subject to our estimates and assumptions.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops, and adjustments to reserves are reflected in our statements of operations for the period in which such estimates are updated.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, future developments may require us to increase claims reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the periods in which such increases occur.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the costs of customer relationships acquired, which would increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	At December 31, 2013 , we had $146.7 million of deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P45_S1	DAC represents costs that vary with and are primarily related to the successful sale and issuance of our insurance policies and are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P45_S2	These costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions, solicitation and printing costs, sales material costs and some support costs, such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Under U.S. GAAP, DAC is amortized to income over the lives of the underlying policies, in relation to the anticipated recognition of premiums.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	In addition, when we acquire a block of insurance policies, we assign a portion of the purchase price to the right to receive future net cash flows from existing insurance and investment contracts and policies.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	This intangible asset, called the cost of customer relationships acquired, or CCRA, represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P47_S2	At December 31, 2013 , we had $23.4 million of CCRA.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P47_S3	We amortize the value of this intangible asset in a manner similar to the amortization of DAC.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our amortization of DAC and CCRA generally depends upon anticipated profits from investments, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, persistency and maintenance expense margins.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	surrender rates were to exceed the assumptions upon which we priced our insurance policies, or if actual persistency proves to be less than our persistency assumptions, especially in the early years of a policy, we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We regularly review the quality of our DAC and CCRA to determine if they are recoverable from future income.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	If these costs are not recoverable, they are charged to expenses in the financial period in which we make this determination.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses, investment returns, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, lapses or persistency may cause us to increase the amortization of DAC or CCRA, or both, or to record a current period expense to increase benefit reserves, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We may be required to recognize an impairment on the value of our goodwill, which would increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the amount paid by us to acquire various life insurance companies over the fair value of their net assets at the date of the acquisition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Under U.S. GAAP, we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the "reporting unit" level, which is either an operating segment or a business that is one level below the operating segment.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Goodwill is impaired if its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P54_S2	This may occur for various reasons, including changes in actual or expected earnings or cash flows of a reporting unit, generation of earnings by a reporting unit at a lower rate than similar businesses or declines in market prices for publicly traded businesses similar to our reporting units.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P54_S3	If any portion of our goodwill becomes impaired, we would be required to recognize the amount of the impairment as a current-period expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P54_S4	Goodwill in our consolidated financial statements was $17.2 million as of December 31, 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We are a defendant in lawsuits, which may adversely affect our financial condition and detract from the time our management is able to devote to our business, and we are subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory matters.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We may from time to time be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our business operations, including, but not limited to:
24090_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	disputes relating to businesses acquired and operated by us.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In the absence of countervailing considerations, we would expect to defend any such claims vigorously.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P58_S1	However, in doing so, we could incur significant defense costs, including attorneys' fees, other direct litigation costs and the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P58_S2	If we suffer an adverse judgment as a result of any claim, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we have received notices from three state departments of treasury (or equivalent state agencies) indicating they intend to audit Citizens, Inc. and certain of its affiliates for compliance with unclaimed property laws.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The audits may result in additional payments to beneficiaries, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws, administrative penalties, interest, and changes to the Company's procedures for the identification and escheatment of abandoned property.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P59_S2	At this time, the Company is not able to estimate any of these possible amounts, but such costs could be substantial for a company our size.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Reinsurers with which we do business could increase their premium rates and may not honor their obligations, leaving us liable for the reinsured coverage.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We reinsure certain risks underwritten by our various insurance subsidiaries.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P61_S2	The high cost of reinsurance or lack of affordable coverage could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P62_S1	We may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities and, even if highly desirable or necessary, we may not be able to obtain replacement reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts or at rates economic to us.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P62_S2	If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling or unable to bear an increase in net exposures, we may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P62_S3	In addition, our reinsurance facilities may be cancelled, pursuant to their terms, upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including a change of control of our Company (generally defined as the acquisition of 10% or more of our voting equity securities) or the failure of our insurance company subsidiaries to maintain the minimum required levels of statutory surplus.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P62_S4	Any of these potential developments could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	In 2013 , we reinsured $467.5 million of face amount of our life insurance policies.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Amounts reinsured in 2013 represented 9.9% of the face amount of direct life insurance in force in that year.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Although the cost of reinsurance is, in some cases, reflected in premium rates, under certain reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer may increase the rate it charges us for reinsurance.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P64_S1	If our cost of reinsurance were to increase, we might not be able to recover these increased costs, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P64_S2	See Note 5 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We may not be able to continue our past strategy of acquiring other U.S. life insurance companies, and we may not realize improvements to our financial results as a result of our past or any future acquisitions.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We have acquired 16 U.S. life insurance companies since 1987.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Our objective in this strategy has been to increase our assets, revenues and capital, improve our competitive position and increase our earnings, in part by realizing certain operating efficiencies associated with economies of scale.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We evaluate possible acquisitions of other insurance companies on an ongoing basis.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P67_S1	While our business model is not dependent primarily upon acquisitions, the time frame for achieving or further improving our market positions can be shortened through acquisitions.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P67_S2	There can be no assurance that suitable acquisitions presenting opportunities for continued growth and operating efficiencies will be available to us, or that we will realize the anticipated financial results from completed acquisitions.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P67_S3	In addition, we face intense competition in seeking to make acquisitions, much of which is from companies with greater financial and human resources than we have.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Even if we identify and complete insurance company acquisitions, we may be unable to integrate them on an economically favorable basis.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Implementation of an acquisition strategy entails a number of risks, including, among others, inaccurate assessment of assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities and the failure to achieve anticipated operating efficiencies, revenues, earnings or cash flow.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P69_S1	The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Our international and domestic operations face significant competition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Our international marketing plan focuses on making available U.S. Dollar-denominated life insurance products to high net worth, high income individuals residing in more than 30 countries.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P71_S1	New competition could increase the supply of available insurance, which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive profitable rates to us, thereby adversely affecting our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Existing barriers to entry in the foreign markets we serve may not be sufficient to impede potential competitors from entering such markets.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P71_S3	In connection with our business with foreign nationals, we experience competition primarily from the following sources, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have:
24090_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Foreign operated companies with U.S. Dollar policies.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We face direct competition from companies that operate in the same manner as we operate in our international markets.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Companies foreign to the countries in which their policies are sold but that issue local currency policies.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Another group of our competitors in the international marketplace consists of companies that are foreign to the countries in which their policies are sold but issue life insurance policies denominated in the local currencies of those countries.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Local currency policies provide the benefit of assets located in the country of foreign residents, but entail risks of uncertainty due to local currency fluctuations, as well as the perceived instability and weakness of local currencies.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Locally operated companies with local currency policies.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P76_S1	We compete with companies formed and operated in the country in which our foreign insureds reside.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Generally, these companies are subject to risks of currency fluctuations, and they primarily use mortality tables based on experience of the local population as a whole.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	based on significantly shorter life spans than those we use.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P77_S1	As a result, the cost of insurance from these companies tends to be higher than ours.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Although these companies typically market their policies to a broader section of the population than do our independent marketing firms and independent consultants, there can be no assurance that these companies will not endeavor to place a greater emphasis on our target market and compete more directly with us.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	In the United States, we compete with more than 1,000 other life insurance companies of various sizes.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P79_S0	The life insurance business in the United States is highly competitive, in part because it is a mature industry that, in recent years, has experienced little to no growth in life insurance sales.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Many domestic life insurance companies have substantially greater financial resources, longer business histories and more diversified lines of insurance coverage than we do.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P79_S2	These companies also have larger sales forces than we have.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P79_S3	Competition in the United States has also increased recently because the life insurance industry is consolidating, with larger, more efficient organizations emerging from the consolidation.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P80_S0	In addition, from time to time, companies enter and exit the markets in which we operate, thereby increasing competition at times when there are new entrants.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P80_S1	We may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices, or for other reasons.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P81_S0	There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in any of our markets.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P81_S1	If we do not, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Recent changes in Colombian law may impede the activities of our independent consultants in Colombia.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Our independent consultants are contractually obligated to comply with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Certain independent consultants in Colombia have indicated new laws that became effective in July 2013 could impede their routine activities relative to introducing new clients to company product offerings and facilitating renewal premium collections.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P83_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we have not experienced any noticeable negative effects from the Colombian law changes upon our business, but believe they could have an adverse impact upon the Colombian portion of our business.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P83_S3	For 2013, approximately 20% of our direct premiums from international clients was generated through our Colombian consultants.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P83_S4	See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Segment Operations - Life Insurance - International Products.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Sales of our products may be reduced if we are unable to (i) establish and maintain commercial relationships with independent marketing firms and independent consultants (ii) attract and retain employee agents or (iii) develop and maintain our distribution sources.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We distribute our insurance products through several distribution channels, including independent marketing firms and independent consultants and our employee agents.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P85_S1	These relationships are significant for both our revenues and our profits.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P85_S2	In our life insurance segment, we depend almost exclusively on the services of independent marketing firms and independent consultants.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P85_S3	In our home service insurance segment, we depend on employee agents whose role in our distribution process is integral to developing and maintaining relationships with policyholders.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Significant competition exists among insurers in attracting and maintaining marketers of demonstrated ability.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Some of our competitors may offer better compensation packages for marketing firms, independent consultants and agents and broader arrays of products and have a greater diversity of distribution resources, better brand recognition, more competitive pricing, lower cost structures and greater financial strength or claims paying ratings than we do.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P86_S2	We compete with other insurers for marketing firms, independent consultants and employee agents primarily on the basis of our compensation and support services.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P86_S3	Any reduction in our ability to attract and retain effective sales representatives could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Loss of the services of our senior management team would likely hinder development of our operating and marketing programs and our strategy for expanding our business.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We rely on the active participation of our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Harold E. Riley (age 85 ), and our Vice Chairman of the Board and President, Rick D. Riley (age 60 ), in connection with the development and execution of our operating and marketing plans and strategy for expanding our business.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P88_S1	We anticipate that their expertise will continue to be of substantial value in connection with our operations.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P88_S2	The loss of the services of either of these individuals could have a significant adverse effect on our business and prospects.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P88_S3	We do not have an employment agreement with either of these persons nor do we carry a key-man insurance policy on either of their lives.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P89_S0	We are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the United States, which increases our costs of doing business and could restrict the conduct of our business.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P90_S0	We are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in U.S. jurisdictions wherein we do business, as well as anti-money laundering regulations adopted under the USA Patriot Act.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Insurance company regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, with substantially lesser protections to shareholders of the regulated insurance companies.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P91_S1	To that end, all the states in which we do business have insurance regulatory agencies with broad powers under law with respect to such things as: licensing companies to transact business; mandating capital and surplus requirements; regulating trade and claims practices; approving policy forms; and restricting companies' ability to enter and exit markets.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P92_S0	The capacity for an insurance company's growth in premiums is partially a function of its required statutory surplus.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P92_S1	Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus, as measured by statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by a company's state of domicile, is considered important by all state insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P92_S2	Failure to maintain required levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action by regulatory authorities.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Most insurance regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant, renew, suspend and revoke licenses and approvals, and could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities, including acquisitions of other insurance companies, require us to add capital to our insurance company subsidiaries, or fine us.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P93_S1	If we are unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, or if our insurance business is determined not to comply fully with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations and their interpretations, including the USA Patriot Act, our revenues, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Although the U.S. federal government has not historically regulated the insurance business, the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, expands the federal presence in insurance oversight.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P94_S1	The Act's requirements include streamlining the state-based regulation of reinsurance and non-admitted insurance (also known as surplus lines insurance, which is property or casualty insurance written by a company that is not licensed to sell policies of insurance in a given state).
24090_14_ITEM1A_P94_S2	This legislation also establishes a new Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury with powers over all lines of insurance except health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P94_S3	The Federal Insurance Office is authorized to, among other things, gather data and information to monitor aspects of the insurance industry, identify issues in the regulation of insurers about insurance matters and preempt state insurance measures under certain circumstances.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P94_S4	As this Act calls for numerous studies and contemplates further regulation, the future impact of the Act on our results of operations or our financial condition cannot be determined at this time, but could have an adverse impact on profitable operations.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Changes in U.S. regulation may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and limit our prospective growth.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Currently, the U.S. Federal Government does not directly regulate the insurance business, although initiatives for Federal regulation of insurance are proposed by members of the U.S. Congress from time to time.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P96_S1	However, Federal legislation and administrative policies in several other areas can materially and adversely affect insurance companies, including our business.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P96_S2	These areas include the USA Patriot Act, financial services regulation, securities regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P96_S3	In addition, various forms of direct federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Our failure to maintain effective information systems could adversely affect our business.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P98_S0	We must maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop new information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P98_S1	If we do not maintain adequate systems, we could experience adverse consequences, including products acquired through acquisition, inadequate information on which to base pricing, underwriting and reserve decisions, regulatory problems, failure to meet prompt payment obligations, increases in administrative expenses and loss of customers.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Some of our information technology systems and software are mainframe-based, legacy-type systems that require an ongoing commitment of resources to maintain current standards.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P99_S1	Our systems utilize proprietary code requiring highly skilled personnel.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P99_S2	Due to the unique nature of our proprietary operating environment, we could have difficulty finding personnel with the skills required to provide ongoing system maintenance and development as we seek to keep pace with changes in our products and business models, information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and policyholder needs.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P100_S0	success is dependent upon, among other things, maintaining and enhancing the effectiveness of existing systems, as well as continuing to integrate, develop and enhance our information systems to support business processes in a cost-effective manner.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Our failure to protect confidential information and privacy could result in the loss of customers, subject us to fines and penalties and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to privacy regulations.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P103_S1	The actions we take to protect confidential information include among other things: monitoring our record retention plans and policies and any changes in state or federal privacy and compliance requirements; maintaining secure storage facilities for tangible records; and limiting access to electronic information in order to safeguard certain information.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P104_S0	In addition, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires that we deliver a notice regarding our privacy policy both at the delivery of an insurance policy and annually thereafter.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Certain exceptions are allowed for sharing of information under joint marketing agreements.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P105_S1	However, certain state laws may require us to obtain a policyholder's consent before we share information.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P106_S0	We have a written information security program with appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect such confidential information.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P106_S1	Cyber security attacks are on the rise throughout the World and while we believe we have taken reasonable steps to secure our customer information we could experience a breach of data.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P106_S2	If we do not comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information, we could experience adverse consequences, including regulatory sanctions, loss of reputation and litigation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P107_S0	The insurance industry in which we operate may be subject to periodic negative publicity, which may negatively impact our financial results.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P108_S0	We interface with and distribute our products to individual consumers.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P108_S1	There may be a perception that these purchasers may be unsophisticated and in need of consumer protection.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P108_S2	Accordingly, from time to time, consumer advocate groups or the media may focus attention on our products, thereby subjecting the insurance industry to periodic negative publicity.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P108_S3	We may also be negatively impacted if other insurance companies engage in practices resulting in increased public attention to our businesses.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P108_S4	Negative publicity may result in lower sales of insurance, lower persistency of our insurance products, increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation, which may further increase our costs of doing business and impede our ability to market our products.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P108_S5	As a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P109_S0	General economic, financial market and political conditions may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected from time to time by general economic, financial market and political conditions, both in the United States and in the foreign countries where our policyowners reside.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P110_S1	These conditions include economic cycles such as: levels of consumer spending; levels of inflation; movements of the financial markets; availability of credit; fluctuations in interest rates, monetary policy or demographics; and legislative and competitive changes.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P111_S0	During periods of economic downturn, such as the ones recently experienced, our insureds may choose not to purchase our insurance products, may terminate existing policies, permit policies to lapse or may choose to reduce the amount of coverage purchased, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P111_S1	Also, our sales of new insurance policies might decrease.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by applicable laws and regulations in the amounts of fees, dividends and other distributions they may make to us.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P112_S1	The inability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us in sufficient amounts for us to conduct our operations could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations or expand our business.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P113_S0	As a holding company, our principal asset is the stock of our subsidiaries.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P114_S0	working capital and other corporate expenses.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P115_S0	The ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to make payments to us is subject to regulation by the states in which they are domiciled, and these payments depend primarily on approved service agreements between us and these subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, the statutory surplus (which is the excess of assets over liabilities as determined under statutory accounting practices prescribed by an insurance company's state of domicile), future statutory earnings (which are earnings as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices) and regulatory restrictions.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P116_S0	Generally, the net assets of our insurance company subsidiaries available for dividends are limited to either the lesser or greater (depending on the state of domicile) of the subsidiary's net gain from operations during the preceding year and 10% of the subsidiary's net statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P117_S0	Except to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of our subsidiaries' creditors, including policyholders, have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors and shareholders.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P117_S1	If any of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates or otherwise reorganizes, our creditors and shareholders will have no right to proceed in their own right against the assets of that subsidiary or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of the subsidiary under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to debt and equity capital and our cost of capital in seeking to expand our business.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P119_S0	The capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility over the past several years.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P119_S1	In some cases, the markets exerted significant downward pressure on availability of debt and equity capital for certain issuers (including short term liquidity and credit capacity).
24090_14_ITEM1A_P119_S2	We believe the availability of debt and equity capital has decreased significantly compared to prior years.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P120_S0	The availability of equity and debt financing to us will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit capacity, as well as the possibility that investors or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P120_S1	Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets may also limit our access to equity capital for us to seek to expand our business.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P120_S2	As such, we may be forced to delay raising debt or equity capital, or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could adversely affect our ability to seek any acquisitions and negatively impact profitability of an acquisition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P121_S0	Unexpected losses in future reporting periods may require us to adjust the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P122_S0	We evaluate our deferred tax asset ( DTA ) quarterly for recoverability based on available evidence.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P122_S1	This process involves management's judgment about assumptions, which are subject to change from period to period due to tax rate changes or variances between our projected operating performance and our actual results.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P122_S2	Ultimately, future adjustments to the DTA valuation allowance, if any, will be determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P123_S0	The realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry back or carry forward periods under applicable tax law.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P124_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we may be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P124_S1	Such an adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and capital position.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P125_S0	The price of our Class A common stock may be adversely affected by decreased participation in the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan (the "Plan").
24090_14_ITEM1A_P126_S0	Most all of our international policyholders participate in the Plan and they invest their policy dividends and benefits in our Class A common stock pursuant to the Plan.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P126_S1	Once a policyholder elects to participate in the Plan, his or her policy benefits are assigned to purchase Citizens Class A common stock under the Plan in the open market.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P126_S2	There is a risk our Class A common stock price could be negatively impacted by a decrease in our policyholders' participation in the Plan.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P126_S3	If fewer policyholders elect to participate in the Plan, or our international premium collections were to decrease as a result of regulatory, economic, or marketing impediments, the trading volume of our Class A stock may decline from its present levels and the demand for our Class A common stock could be negatively impacted.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P127_S0	Control of our Company, through the ownership of our Class B Common Stock, may be held by a 501(c)(3) charitable foundation established by our Founder and we cannot determine whether any change in our management, operations, or operating strategies will occur as a result of such an ownership change.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P128_S0	Harold E. Riley, our Founder, Chairman and CEO, is the beneficial owner of 100% of the Citizens Class B common stock, which is held in the name of the Harold E. Riley Trust ("Trust"), of which he serves as Trustee.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P128_S1	Citizens' Class A and Class B common stock are identical in all respects, except the Class B common stock elects a simple majority of the Board and receives one-half of any cash dividends paid, on a per share basis, to the Class A shares.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P128_S2	Therefore, Mr. Riley controls our Company.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P128_S3	The Class A common stock elects the remainder of the Board.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P128_S4	The Trust documents provide that upon Mr. Riley's death, the Class B common stock will be transferred from the Trust to the Harold E. Riley Foundation, a charitable organization established under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Foundation").
24090_14_ITEM1A_P128_S5	In addition, the Trust documents provide that Mr. Riley may at any time transfer the Class B common stock held by the Trust to the Foundation.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P128_S6	It is unclear what, if any, changes would occur to our board, management structure, or corporate operating strategies as a result of different ownership of our Class B common stock.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P129_S0	There are a substantial number of our issued shares of Class A common stock eligible for future sale in the public market.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P129_S1	The sale of these shares could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fall.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P130_S0	There were 49,080,114 shares of our Class A common stock issued as of December 31, 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM1A_P130_S1	Our executive officers, directors and management owned approximately 3,340,597 shares of our Class A common stock as of December 31, 2013 , representing approximately 7% of our then outstanding Class A common stock.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P130_S2	Almost all of these shares have been registered for public resale and generally may be sold freely.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P130_S3	In the event of a sale of some or all of these shares or the perceived sale of these shares, the market price of our Class A common stock could fall substantially.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P131_S0	The price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P132_S0	Our Class A common stock price has historically fluctuated and is likely to fluctuate in the future and could decline materially because of the volatility of the stock market in general, decreased participation in the Plan referred to above or a variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: quarterly or annual variations in actual or anticipated results of our operations; interest rate fluctuations; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; competition and other factors affecting the life insurance business generally; and conditions in the U.S. and world economies.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P133_S0	Our Class A common shareholders do not control us and have a limited ability to influence our business policies and corporate actions and are not by themselves able to elect any of our directors.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P134_S0	It is difficult for Class A common shareholders to elect any of our directors or otherwise exert any significant influence over our business.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P134_S1	The sole holder of our outstanding Class B common stock is entitled to elect a simple majority of our board of directors and therefore controls us.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P134_S2	All of our Class B common stock is currently owned by the Harold E. Riley Trust, of which Harold E. Riley, our founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, is the sole trustee.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P134_S3	Additionally, Harold E. Riley beneficially owns approximately 4% of the issued shares of our Class A common stock.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P135_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as applicable state insurance laws, may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P136_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as various state insurance laws, may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a takeover attempt our shareholders might consider in their best interests.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P136_S1	As a result, our shareholders will be prevented from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our Class A common stock that may be offered by a bidder in a takeover context.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P136_S2	Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P137_S0	The following provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws make it difficult for our Class A shareholders to replace or remove our directors and have other anti-takeover effects that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt:
24090_14_ITEM1A_P138_S0	our board of directors may issue one or more series of preferred stock without the approval of our shareholders.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P139_S0	State insurance laws generally require prior approval of a change in control of an insurance company.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P139_S1	Generally, such laws provide that control over an insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the insurer.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P140_S0	In considering an application to acquire control of an insurer, an insurance commissioner generally will consider such factors as the experience, competence and financial strength of the proposed acquirer, the integrity of the proposed acquirer's board of directors and executive officers, the proposed acquirer's plans for the management and operation of the insurer, and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the acquisition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P140_S1	In addition, a person seeking to acquire control of an insurance company is required in some states to make filings prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and the target insurance company and their affiliates have sufficiently large market shares in particular lines of insurance in those states.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P140_S2	These state insurance requirements may delay, deter or prevent our ability to complete an acquisition.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P141_S0	We have never paid any cash dividends on our Class A common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P142_S0	We have never paid cash dividends on our Class A common stock, as it is our policy to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business.
24090_14_ITEM1A_P142_S1	We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
24090_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	We own our principal office in Austin, Texas, consisting of an 80,000 square foot office building in addition to approximately one acre of land nearby that houses storage facilities.
24090_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	Approximately 50,000 square feet is occupied or reserved for our operations.
24090_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also own a training facility at Lake Buchanan, Texas.
24090_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	In addition, we own other properties in Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana that are incidental to our operations.
24090_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are a defendant in a lawsuit filed on August 6, 1999, in the Texas District Court, Austin, Texas, now styled Delia Bolanos Andrade, et al., Plaintiffs, v. Citizens Insurance Company of America, et al., Defendants in which a class was originally certified by the trial court and reversed by the Texas Supreme Court in 2007 with an order to the trial court to conduct further proceedings consistent with its ruling.
24090_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	The underlying lawsuit alleged that certain life insurance policies CICA made available to non-U.S. residents, when combined with a policy feature that allowed certain cash benefits to be assigned to two non-U.S. trusts for the purpose of accumulating ownership of our Class A common stock, along with allowing the policyholders to make additional contributions to the trusts, were actually offers and sales of securities that occurred in Texas by unregistered dealers in violation of the Texas securities laws.
24090_14_ITEM3_P0_S2	The remedy sought was rescission and return of the insurance premium payments.
24090_14_ITEM3_P0_S3	On December 9, 2009, the trial court denied the recertification of the class after conducting additional proceedings in accordance with the Texas Supreme Court's ruling.
24090_14_ITEM3_P0_S4	The remaining plaintiffs must now proceed individually, and not as a class, if they intend to pursue their claims against us.
24090_14_ITEM3_P0_S5	Since the December 9, 2009 trial court ruling, no individual cases have been further pursued by the plaintiffs.
24090_14_ITEM3_P0_S6	The probability of the plaintiffs further pursuing their cases individually is unknown.
24090_14_ITEM3_P0_S7	An estimate of any possible loss or range of losses cannot be made at this time in regard to individuals pursuing claims.
24090_14_ITEM3_P0_S8	However, should the plaintiffs further pursue their claims individually, we intend to vigorously defend any proceedings.
24090_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	The Company is vigorously defending a number of matters in various stages of development and a number of individual lawsuits, which are immaterial to the Company's financial statements.
24090_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol CIA.
24090_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	Quarterly high and low closing prices per share of our Class A common stock as reported by the NYSE are shown below.
24090_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	The number of stockholders on record on March 3, 2014 was as follows:
24090_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	We have never paid cash dividends on our Class A or B common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
24090_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	We did not purchase any of our equity securities during any quarter in 2011 , 2012 or 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM5_P5_S0	We do not maintain any equity compensation plans or arrangements.
24090_14_ITEM5_P5_S1	Thus, we do not have any securities authorized for issuance under these types of plans, nor have we issued any options, warrants or similar instruments to purchase any of our equity securities.
24090_14_ITEM5_P6_S0	The following graph compares the change in the Company s cumulative total stockholder return on its common stock over a five-year period.
24090_14_ITEM5_P6_S1	Composite and the Hemscott Group Index, a peer group of major U.S.-based insurance companies.
24090_14_ITEM5_P7_S0	The peer group index weights individual company returns for stock market capitalization.
24090_14_ITEM5_P7_S1	The companies included in the peer group index are shown in the following table.
24090_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table presents selected financial data of the Company.
24090_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	This should be read in conjunction with Item 7.
24090_14_ITEM6_P0_S2	"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 8.
24090_14_ITEM6_P0_S3	"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.
24090_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," for information that may affect the comparability of the financial data contained in the above table.
24090_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following is management's discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations of the Company.
24090_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	It is intended to be a discussion of certain key financial information regarding the Company and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes to this report on Form 10-K.
24090_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	We conduct operations as an insurance holding company emphasizing ordinary life insurance products in niche markets where we believe we can achieve competitive advantages.
24090_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	As an insurance provider, we collect premiums on an ongoing basis to pay future benefits to our policy and contract holders.
24090_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company derives its revenues principally from 1) premiums earned for insurance coverages provided to insureds; 2) net investment income; and 3) net realized capital gains and losses.
24090_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Profitability of our insurance operations depends heavily upon the Company s underwriting discipline, as we seek to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, management of claims, use of reinsurance, the size of our in force block, actual mortality and morbidity experience, and our ability to manage our expense ratio, which we accomplish through economies of scale and management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses.
24090_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future losses based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the Company s response to competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels.
24090_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Company seeks to price our insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin.
24090_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	For many of our insurance products, the Company is required to obtain approval for the premium rates from state insurance departments.
24090_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	The profitability of fixed annuities, riders and other spread-based product features depends largely on the Company s ability to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on assets and interest credited to policyholders.
24090_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	The investment return, or yield, on invested assets is an important element of the Company s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before benefits are paid.
24090_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	The majority of the Company s invested assets have been held in available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, primarily in asset classes of corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and government obligation bonds.
24090_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	The current and projected low interest rate environment is having a significant impact on the determination of insurance contract liabilities and assets regarding reserves and deferred acquisition costs.
24090_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	The primary investment objective for the Company is to maximize economic value, consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including the management of credit risk and interest rate sensitivity of invested assets, while generating sufficient after-tax income to meet policyholder and corporate obligations.
24090_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Company maintains a conservative investment strategy that may vary based on a variety of factors including business needs, regulatory requirements and tax considerations.
24090_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	The 2013 financial results are driven by our conservative business management and traditional life product sales.
24090_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	The low interest rate environment continues to impact our results and our industry as investment yields are an integral component of our business operations.
24090_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Realized net investment losses during 2013 of $0.3 million were recognized as $0.4 million of losses was recorded on sales of two equity mutual fund issuers, offset by gains of $0.1 million on calls of bond securities.
24090_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	In 2012 and 2011 gains resulted primarily from sales of securities that had been previously impaired due to declines in market values.
24090_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	These gains were partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments on investment securities and other long-term assets that were recorded in 2012 and 2011 of $1,319,000 and $631,000 , respectively, reported as realized losses.
24090_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	2013 changes in reserves resulted in liability increases resulting from increased sales of endowment products that build up reserves at a faster pace than whole life longer term mortality based products.
24090_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	Additionally, the sustained low interest rate environment also results in a higher reserve development due to the lower interest yield assumptions over the past several years.
24090_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	For over thirty-five years, CICA and its predecessors have accepted policy applications from foreign nationals for U.S. Dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies.
24090_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	We make our insurance products available using third-party marketing organizations and independent marketing consultants.
24090_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Endowment product sales have been on the rise and represented approximately 73% of new sales.
24090_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	The Company offers a ten, fifteen and twenty year endowment and our top selling endowment is a product that matures at age sixty-five.
24090_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	We also introduced a new product in 2011 that is an endowment at age eighteen with a payout over four or five years.
24090_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Through the domestic market of our Life Insurance segment, we provide ordinary whole life, credit life insurance, and final expense policies to middle and lower income families and individuals in certain markets in the mountain west, mid-west and southern U.S.
24090_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	The majority of our domestic revenues are generated by the operations of domestic life insurance companies we have acquired since 1987.
24090_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	We provide final expense ordinary life insurance to middle and lower income individuals in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	Our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through a home service marketing distribution system utilizing employee-agents who work on a route system to collect premiums and service policyholders, and through networks of funeral homes that collect premiums and provide personal policyholder service.
24090_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Significant economic issues impacting our business and industry currently and into the future are discussed below.
24090_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	It is predicted that the interest rate environment will remain low for the foreseeable future, which translates into lower profit margins for insurers.
24090_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	We have been impacted by the historically low interest rate environment over the past several years as our fixed income investment portfolio, primarily invested in callable securities, has been reinvested at lower yields.
24090_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	The Company s conservative investment strategy has not changed but we have focused new purchases into holding of state municipalities and essential service issuers compared to our historical investment in U.S. government holdings.
24090_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	Our investment earnings also impact the reserve and Deferred Acquisition Costs ( DAC ) balances, as assumptions are used in the development of the balances.
24090_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	Due to the recent decline in investment yields on our portfolio, our projection of long-term investment returns has declined.
24090_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	This has resulted in increasing the reserves on policies issued in the current year, as well as reducing the DAC asset.
24090_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	As an increasing percentage of the world population reaches retirement age, we believe we will benefit from increased demand for living benefit products rather than death products, as aging baby boomers will require cash accumulation to pay expenses to meet their lifetime income needs.
24090_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	Our ordinary life products are designed to accumulate cash values to provide for living expenses in a policy owner's later years, while continuously providing a death benefit.
24090_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	We believe there is a trend toward consolidation of domestic life insurance companies, due to significant losses incurred by the life insurance industry as a result of the credit crisis and recent economic pressures, as well as increasing costs of regulatory compliance for domestic life insurance companies.
24090_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	We believe this trend should be a benefit to our acquisition strategy as more complementary acquisition candidates may become available for us to consider.
24090_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Many of the events and trends affecting the life insurance industry have had an impact on the life reinsurance industry.
24090_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	These events have led to a decline in the availability of reinsurance.
24090_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	While we currently cede a limited amount of our primary insurance business to reinsurers, we may find it difficult to obtain reinsurance in the future, forcing us to seek reinsurers who are more expensive to us.
24090_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	If we cannot obtain affordable reinsurance coverage, either our net exposures will increase or we will have to reduce our underwriting commitments.
24090_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	While our management has more than 40 years of experience in writing life insurance policies for foreign residents, changes related to foreign government laws and regulations and application of them, along with currency controls affecting our foreign resident insureds could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	In 2008, the Company acquired Ozark National Life Insurance Company ( ONLIC ), an Arkansas domiciled life company.
24090_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	This entity provided an Arkansas field force of home service agents and funeral homes selling pre-need and final expense policies and was merged into SPLIC as of October 1, 2009, and is included in the Home Service segment.
24090_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	In the first quarter of 2009, the Company completed its acquisition of Integrity Capital Corporation ("ICC").
24090_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	ICC is the parent of Integrity Capital Insurance Company ("ICIC"), an Indiana life insurance company.
24090_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	Both ICC and ICIC were merged into CICA effective April 1, 2011.

24090_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	At the time the agreements were executed, both companies were under receivership with the Louisiana Department of Insurance.
24090_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	In total, SPLIC assumed approximately $4.5 million in reserve liabilities and received approximately $4.6 million in cash, with a minimal reinsurance ceding commission being paid.
24090_14_ITEM7_P28_S3	These transactions are accounted for under business combination accounting and are not deemed material.
24090_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	On October 7, 2013, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with Magnolia Guaranty Life Insurance Company ("MGLIC") in the amount of $5.2 million.
24090_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	MGLIC is a Mississippi Company that began writing business in 1992 and issues primarily industrial life policies through independent funeral homes in the state of Mississippi.

24090_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	A discussion of consolidated results is presented below, followed by a discussion of Segment Operations and financial results by segment.
24090_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Insurance revenues are primarily generated from premium revenues and investment income.
24090_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	In addition, realized gains and losses on investment holdings can significantly impact revenues from year to year.
24090_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Premium income derived from life, accident and health, and property insurance sales, increased 3.7% during 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	The increase resulted primarily from renewal premiums, which totaled $148.3 million , $142.2 million and $135.1 million in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
24090_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	New sales, termed as first year premiums, increased 4.0%, 6.1%, and 6.6% in the life segment in 2013, 2012 and 2011.
24090_14_ITEM7_P32_S3	Endowment sales represent a significant portion of new business sales internationally with the 20 year endowment and endowment to age 65 as our top products.
24090_14_ITEM7_P32_S4	In addition, most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision, which allows the policyholder to use cash value of a policy to pay premiums.
24090_14_ITEM7_P32_S5	The policy loan asset balance increased 13.7% and 10.0% in 2013 and 2012 , year over year.
24090_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	Net investment income increased to $36.6 million in 2013 compared to $31.7 million in 2012 , due to an increase in yields from new investments primarily in municipal and corporate issues and as we experienced higher average invested assets as a result of investment of new premium revenue.
24090_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	Net investment income performance is summarized as follows.
24090_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	We have traditionally invested in fixed maturity securities with a large percent held in callable issues.
24090_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	Over the past three years, we have experienced significant call activity related to fixed maturity security holdings due to the historically low interest rate environment.
24090_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	The recent decline in yield rates has been leveling off and is beginning to rise as noted in the table above.
24090_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	interest rates begin to rise, our call risk will diminish and our portfolio yield will rise more slowly over time, as new money investments would be made at higher rates.
24090_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	Investment income from fixed maturity securities accounted for approximately 84.8% of total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	We have reduced investment holdings in bonds of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, such as Federal National Mortgage Association ( FNMA ) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( FHLMC ), which comprised 7.6% of the total fixed maturity portfolio based on amortized cost at December 31, 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	We have increased our investment purchases of corporate and municipal securities over the past several years, focusing on utility service sectors in these security categories.
24090_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	In addition, we currently have $35.0 million invested in equity securities related to bond mutual funds as these securities offer a competitive yield with a shorter duration.
24090_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Investment income from fixed maturity investments increased for the year of 2013 due to a rise in overall bond yields as noted above relative to the fixed maturity portfolio.
24090_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	In addition, the increase in the policy loans asset balance, which represents policyholders utilizing their accumulated policy cash value, contributed to the increase to investment income.
24090_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments .
24090_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	In 2013 , we sold two equity bond funds which resulted in a realized loss of $0.4 million which is reduced by gains on bond calls during the year.
24090_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	The Company sold equity mutual funds in 2012 and 2011 , which were previously impaired, and realized gains of $0.6 million and $1.3 million , respectively.
24090_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Realized investment gains (losses) are as follows.
24090_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	Included in net realized investment gains and losses are OTTI on investments.
24090_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	We recorded an OTTI write-down in 2012 of $1,319,000 related to one coal powered energy issuer debt security holding which has a maturity date in 2017.
24090_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	In 2011 we recorded an OTTI of $70,000 related to one American Airlines ( AMR ) debt security holding that had a maturity date in 2012.
24090_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	AMR declared bankruptcy in November of 2011.
24090_14_ITEM7_P42_S4	We also recorded an impairment in 2011 of $0.6 million related to an investment property that was acquired as part of the ONLIC acquisition in 2008.
24090_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Decrease in Fair Value of Warrants .
24090_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	In 2012, all of the remaining warrants outstanding were either exercised or converted into our Class A common stock, due to an election by the warrant holders, or expiration.
24090_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	We recognized a gain on the decrease in fair value of warrants of $0.5 million and $1.1 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
24090_14_ITEM7_P43_S3	The 2012 and 2011 gain was the result of the significant decrease in the number of warrants outstanding due to expirations and exercises.
24090_14_ITEM7_P43_S4	The warrant liability was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which projects the future value of the warrants when they expire.
24090_14_ITEM7_P43_S5	Current accounting standards require the change in the value of the warrant liability be recorded as a component of revenues.
24090_14_ITEM7_P43_S6	When the liability increased we incurred a loss, and when the liability decreased we recognized income.
24090_14_ITEM7_P43_S7	There were no warrants outstanding during 2013.
24090_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	As noted in the table below, claims and surrenders decreased from $64.7 million in 2012 to $64.4 million in 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	The Company monitors death claims based upon expectations.
24090_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	The claims experience was favorable in 2013 , decreasing by 4.4% from 2012 recorded amounts.
24090_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	These values may routinely fluctuate from year to year.
24090_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	Additionally, 2011 results include a $0.8 million incurred but not reported release of liability related to our claim expense calculation.
24090_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	Policy surrenders increased in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , but remained at a level that represents approximately 0.5% of direct ordinary whole life insurance inforce.
24090_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	The increase in surrender expense is primarily related to our international business and is expected to increase over time due to the aging of this block of business.
24090_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	A significant portion of surrenders relates to policies that have been in force over fifteen years and no longer have a surrender charge associated with them.
24090_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	Total direct insurance inforce reported in 2013 was $4.7 billion compared to $4.6 billion in and 2012 and 2011 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Endowment benefits increased in 2012 and decreased slightly in 2013.
24090_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	We have a series of international policies that carry an immediate endowment benefit of an amount selected by the policy owner.
24090_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	These benefits have been popular in the Pacific Rim and Latin America, where the Company has experienced increased interest in our guaranteed products in recent years.
24090_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	Like policy dividends, annual guaranteed endowments are factored into the premium and, as such, the increase has no impact on profitability.
24090_14_ITEM7_P50_S3	The Company expects these benefits to continue to increase as this block of business increases and persists.
24090_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	Property claims decreased 13% to approximately $2.0 million in 2013 compared with the amount reported for 2012 due to Hurricane Issac claims experience in the prior year with $0.5 million uninsured losses.
24090_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	The 2011 reported property claim amounts were lower than historical experience.
24090_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	The change in future policy benefit reserves has increased 11.3% and 14.4% in 2013 and 2012 due primarily to the current low interest rate environment necessitating higher reserves for policies issued in the last few years due to lower long term yield projections compared to prior assumptions.
24090_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	In addition, we continue to experience growth in new sales of endowment products, which require higher initial reserve levels, than whole life products.
24090_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	Endowment sales totaled approximately $14.3 million , $14.3 million and $12.3 million in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
24090_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Policyholder dividends have risen at a rate corresponding with the growth rate in new international life insurance premiums.
24090_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	The Company issues long duration participating policies to foreign residents that are expected to pay dividends to policyholders based upon actual experience.
24090_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	Policyholder dividends are factored into the premiums and have no impact on profitability.
24090_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	Commission expense fluctuates in a direct relationship to new and renewal insurance premiums and has increased 2.7% in 2013 compared to 2012 as premium revenues have increased.
24090_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	Total general expenses have decreased over the past several years on a consolidated basis as management has created efficiencies and improved processes.
24090_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	The reduction year to year was primarily related to lower audit, legal and consulting fees, as well as employee benefit cost reductions.
24090_14_ITEM7_P55_S2	In 2013, claims cost increased related to our self insurance health plan for our employees resulting in approximately $0.5 million increase to our overall benefit expenses.
24090_14_ITEM7_P55_S3	We also had an increase in temporary labor staffing costs of $0.2 million related to assistance with operations projects.
24090_14_ITEM7_P55_S4	In 2013 , we also settled litigation in the amount of $0.2 million which was filed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina by the Louisiana Attorney General against all insurers writing homeowner policies in Louisiana.
24090_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	We perform an expense study on an annual basis, utilizing an enterprise-wide time study, and we adjust cost allocations among entities as needed based upon this review.
24090_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	Any allocation changes are reflected in the segment operations, but do not impact total expenses.
24090_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	Capitalized deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") were $29.4 million , $29.1 million and $27.8 million in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	These costs will vary based upon successful efforts related to newly issued policies and renewal business.
24090_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	Significantly lower amounts are capitalized related to renewal business in correlation with the lower commissions paid on that business compared to first year business which have higher commission rates.
24090_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is impacted by persistency and may fluctuate from year to year.
24090_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	Amortization in 2013 increased as we experienced lower persistency in both the life and home service segment.
24090_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	Amortization costs increased in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of the asset balance growth.
24090_14_ITEM7_P58_S3	Policy persistency was comparable in the life segment for 2012 and 2011 periods presented, but declined in the Home Service segment in 2012 and 2011, resulting in higher amortization.
24090_14_ITEM7_P58_S4	In addition, the prolonged low interest rate environment impacted the assumptions used in the development of the DAC asset for new policies issued and resulted in a lower DAC balance and decreased amortization by approximately $0.2 million and increased amortization by $0.4 million and $1.4 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
24090_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Cost of Customer Relationships Acquired and Other Intangibles .
24090_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	The higher amortization in 2011 was related primarily to the ICC acquisition and greater amortization due to the increase in lapses on this new block of business.
24090_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	The amortization level recorded in 2013 and 2012 is indicative of what we expect going forward or until we make additional acquisitions.
24090_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	Federal income tax expense was $2.1 million , $1.5 million and $2.8 million in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of 30.8% , 25.0% and 25.1% , respectively.
24090_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	The Company began purchasing tax-exempt state and local bonds in the second half of 2011 and continued to do so in 2012 and 2013 in the non-insurance companies where the full tax benefit can be realized.
24090_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	In addition, the fair value change related to outstanding warrants of $0.5 million , and $1.1 million were reported as an increase in revenues in 2012 and 2011 respectively, which was not taxable and also impacted our corporate tax rate.
24090_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Differences between our effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate result from income and expense items that are treated differently for financial reporting and tax purposes.
24090_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	Our business is comprised of three operating business segments, as detailed below.
24090_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	Our insurance operations are the primary focus of the Company, as those segments generate the majority of our income.
24090_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	The amount of insurance, number of policies, and average face amounts of policies issued during the periods indicated are shown below.
24090_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	These segments are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
24090_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	The Company evaluates profit and loss performance based on net income before federal income taxes.
24090_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	Our Life Insurance segment primarily issues ordinary whole life insurance in U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents in approximately 30 countries through approximately 1,500 independent marketing consultants, and domestically through over 400 independent marketing firms and consultants throughout the United States.
24090_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Premium revenues increased for 2013 compared to 2012 and 2011 , due to higher international renewal premiums, which have experienced strong persistency as this block of insurance ages.
24090_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	First year premiums increased in the current year, reflecting improved new business production in all products internationally.
24090_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	Sales from Colombia, Ecuador, Taiwan and Venezuela represented the majority of the first year premium increase.
24090_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Endowment sales represent a significant portion of new business sales internationally, as these products continue to exceed our whole life sales in the current markets.
24090_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	In addition, most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision, which allows the policyholder to use cash value of a policy to pay premiums.
24090_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	The policy loan asset balance increased 13.7% year over year.
24090_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	Life Insurance premium breakout is detailed below.
24090_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	The following table sets forth, by country, our direct premiums from our international life insurance business for the periods indicated.
24090_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	Our international business and premium collections could be impacted by future changes relative to laws, regulations or economic events in the countries from which we accept applications.

24090_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	Our international business and premium collections could be impacted by future changes relative to laws, regulations or economic events in the countries from which we accept applications.
24090_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	Currently Venezuela is experiencing civil unrest due to local demonstrations against crime, corruption and soaring inflation.
24090_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	In addition, there were recent law changes in Colombia that may impact activities of our independent consultants.

24090_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	The following table sets forth our direct premiums by state from our domestic business for the periods indicated.
24090_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	A number of domestic life insurance companies we acquired had blocks of accident and health insurance policies.
24090_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	We have ceded this business to Puritan Life Insurance Company ("Puritan"), an unaffiliated insurance company under a coinsurance agreement, under which it assumes substantially all of our accident and health policies.
24090_14_ITEM7_P74_S2	The premium amounts ceded under the coinsurance agreement in the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 were $56 thousand , $3.9 million and $4.5 million , respectively.
24090_14_ITEM7_P74_S3	The coinsurance agreement allows for full assumption by Puritan of this business upon approval by state insurance authorities.
24090_14_ITEM7_P74_S4	The decrease in premiums ceded for 2013 was due to the fact that Puritan received state approval in many states and has obtained over 95% assumption of all policies during 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	Net investment income has increased as the annual yield has increased 44 basis points in this segment from 2012, as discussed in the Consolidated Results of Operations above.
24090_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	Realized losses of $0.2 million and gains of $0.5 million and $1.3 million were recognized in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , due to the sale of two bond mutual fund holdings in 2013 and due to disposals in 2012 and 2011 of previously impaired equity mutual funds.
24090_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	A breakout of claims and surrender benefits is detailed below.
24090_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	Death claims expense decreased 21.1 % in 2013 due to favorable experience in the current year and increased 5.3% in 2012 compared to 2011 due to more reported claims.
24090_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	In addition, 2011 results included a $0.2 million release of incurred but not reported liability related to our claim experience calculation.
24090_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	Mortality experience is closely monitored by the Company as a key performance indicator and these amounts were within expected levels.
24090_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	The increase in surrender expense is primarily related to our international business and is expected to increase over time due to the aging of this block of business.
24090_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	The majority of policy surrender benefits paid is attributable to our international business and was related to policies that have been in force over fifteen years, where surrender charges are no longer applicable.
24090_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	Endowment benefit expense results from the election by policyholders of a product feature that provides an annual benefit.
24090_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	This is a fixed benefit over the life of the contract, and this expense will increase with new sales and improved persistency.
24090_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	Other policy benefits increased in the current year due primarily to interest paid on premium deposits and dividend accumulations, as these policyholder liability accounts have increased.
24090_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	Increase in Future Policy Benefit Reserves .
24090_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	Policy benefit reserves in 2013 increased compared to the same period in 2012 , primarily from the effect of the current low interest rate environment on reserve development for policies issued in the last few years which have higher reserve build up compared to prior issue years.
24090_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	The accounting guidance of long duration contracts we sell requires the Company to lock in the original assumptions such as mortality, interest, surrenders and expenses at the time the initial policies are written, therefore gains or losses attributable to actual experience that differs from the original assumptions flows through the income statement in the period where in the differences occur.
24090_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	In addition, reserves have risen year over year for all periods presented due to the increased sales of endowment products, which build up reserve balances more quickly compared to other life product sales.
24090_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	Endowment sales totaled approximately $14.3 million , $14.3 million and $12.3 million , representing approximately 73.0% , 76.0% and 69.4% of total new first year premium in 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , respectively.
24090_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	Policyholder dividends have risen at a rate that corresponds with the growth rate in new international life insurance premiums.
24090_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	The Company issues long duration participating policies to foreign residents that are expected to pay dividends to policyholders based upon actual experience.
24090_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	Policyholder dividends are factored into the premiums and have no impact on profitability.
24090_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	Capitalization and Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs .
24090_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	Capitalized costs increased, as commission related costs have increased in the current year compared to 2012 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P88_S2	Amortization of DAC increased in the current year by 4.1% from 2012 as the asset balance has increased and our persistency was lower in the current year.
24090_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	Commission expense increase is directly related to the increase in premiums as noted above.
24090_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	First year policy premiums pay a higher commission rate than renewal policy premiums.
24090_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	The expenses are allocated by segment, based upon an annual expense study performed by the Company, and were up due to employee health claims, as we are self-insured, and employee costs associated with temporary employees assisting on operations projects.
24090_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	Our Home Service Insurance segment provides pre-need and final expense ordinary life insurance and annuities to middle and lower income individuals primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.

24090_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	The premiums in this segment were flat for the year.
24090_14_ITEM7_P93_S1	In 2012, there was an increase of approximately $180,000 of single premium revenues related to a system error in recording increasing policy benefits that are used to pay for paid up additions and were reflected as a one time adjustment as noted below under Policyholders' dividends.
24090_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	The following table sets forth our direct premiums by state for the periods indicated.
24090_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	Net investment income has increased as our overall portfolio yield has increased 13 basis points from 2012 yield as discussed in the Consolidated Results of Operations above.
24090_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	Net investment income for our home service insurance segment is summarized as follows:
24090_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	Realized Investment Gains (Losses), Net .
24090_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	We sold two bond mutual fund issues in 2013 which resulted in a realized loss of $57,000 which was offset by bond gains on calls of $36,000.
24090_14_ITEM7_P97_S2	Net losses on investment of $0.3 million in 2012 is related to an OTTI adjustment on one coal energy provider debt issuer.
24090_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	The operations of this energy provider have been negatively impacted by challenging environment in the coal-fired generation sector and overall decline in the price of power it can charge to customers.
24090_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	This fixed maturity security is scheduled to mature in 2017.
24090_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	Net realized losses of $0.6 million in 2011 are due primarily from an OTTI on one American Airlines debt security that totaled $70,000 due to the issuer filing bankruptcy, and a write-down of approximately $0.5 million related to investment real estate for an office building in Arkansas.
24090_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	We obtained an appraisal in 2011 that reflected a loss in fair value.
24090_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	A breakout of claims and surrender benefits is detailed below.
24090_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	Death claims expense was higher in 2013 compared to 2012 due to more reported claims in the current year.
24090_14_ITEM7_P102_S1	In addition, 2011 results include a $0.6 million incurred but not reported release of liability related to our claim experience calculation.
24090_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	Mortality experience is closely monitored by the Company as a key performance indicator and these amounts were within expected levels.
24090_14_ITEM7_P104_S0	Surrender expenses have increased as the Home Service block grows, and is consistent with expectations for the current economic conditions.
24090_14_ITEM7_P105_S0	Increase in Future Policy Benefit Reserves .
24090_14_ITEM7_P105_S1	The current year change in reserves was minimal as premiums were relatively flat and lapse experience was comparable to 2012.
24090_14_ITEM7_P105_S2	We noted increased lapse experience in 2012 compared to 2011.
24090_14_ITEM7_P105_S3	We believe the increase in lapses was due to economic pressures including increased unemployment.
24090_14_ITEM7_P106_S0	The increase in 2012 compared to prior and subsequent years resulted from a manual adjustment that was properly set up in 2012 in the policy administration system to appropriately reflect increasing policy values from annual paid up additions.
24090_14_ITEM7_P106_S1	This one time increase in dividends paid and single premium revenue of approximately $180,000 had no impact on the overall segment earnings for the year 2012.
24090_14_ITEM7_P106_S2	The reserve liability had been previously set up relative to this policy feature and was decreased by $35,000 based upon the system calculated value.
24090_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	Commission expense decreased in 2013 and 2012 compared to 2011 as agents are compensated based upon month-to-month route premium growth that has been impacted by increased policy lapses.
24090_14_ITEM7_P107_S1	This results in a lower commission to premium relationship as compensation is reduced.
24090_14_ITEM7_P107_S2	In addition, we consolidated some collection routes in 2012, which resulted in elimination of one district office and its related staffing thereby also reducing some commission expense.
24090_14_ITEM7_P108_S0	The expenses are allocated by segment based upon an annual expense study performed by the Company.
24090_14_ITEM7_P108_S1	Overall expenses were up in 2013 due to an increase in employee health claims, as we are self insured and due to temporary employee labor costs as we have added staffing to assist with operations projects.
24090_14_ITEM7_P108_S2	In 2013 , we also settled litigation in the amount of $0.2 million which was filed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina by the Louisiana Attorney General against all insurers writing homeowner policies in Louisiana.
24090_14_ITEM7_P109_S0	Capitalization and Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs ("DAC") .
24090_14_ITEM7_P109_S1	DAC capitalization is directly correlated to fluctuations in first year commissions.
24090_14_ITEM7_P109_S2	Amortization was relatively level as we experienced comparable lapse rates in the three years presented in this segment.
24090_14_ITEM7_P110_S0	We monitor lapse rates as a key component of our insurance operations.
24090_14_ITEM7_P110_S1	Amortization in 2011 includes an adjustment that resulted in an increase of $0.3 million due to a refinement in an estimate using system generated information related to SPLIC assumptions.
24090_14_ITEM7_P111_S0	This segment represents the administrative support entities to the insurance operations whose revenues are primarily intercompany and have been eliminated in consolidation under GAAP, which typically results in a segment loss.
24090_14_ITEM7_P111_S1	In 2012 and 2011 the fair value adjustment related to the Company's warrants to purchase Class A common stock were recorded which resulted in a gain of $0.4 million and $1.1 million.
24090_14_ITEM7_P111_S2	These amounts fluctuate due to the movement in our Class A common stock price and fair value calculation for warrants using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
24090_14_ITEM7_P111_S3	There were no warrants outstanding during 2013.
24090_14_ITEM7_P112_S0	Financial stability and the prevention of capital erosion are important investment considerations for the Company.
24090_14_ITEM7_P113_S0	A primary investment goal is the conservation of assets due to the long-term nature of a significant portion of our liabilities.
24090_14_ITEM7_P113_S1	The administration of our investment portfolios is handled internally, pursuant to board-approved investment guidelines, with all trading activity approved by a committee of each entity s respective board of directors.
24090_14_ITEM7_P113_S2	The guidelines used require that bonds, both government and corporate, are of high quality, investment grade and comprise a majority of the investment portfolio.
24090_14_ITEM7_P113_S3	State insurance statutes prescribe the quality and percentage of the various types of investments that may be made by insurance companies and generally permit investment in qualified state, municipal, federal and foreign government obligations, high quality corporate bonds, preferred and common stock, mortgage loans and real estate within certain specified percentages.
24090_14_ITEM7_P113_S4	The assets selected are intended to mature in accordance with the average maturity of the insurance products and to provide the cash flow for our insurance company subsidiaries to meet their respective policyholder obligations.
24090_14_ITEM7_P114_S0	The following table shows the carrying value of our investments by investment category and cash and cash equivalents, and the percentage of each to total invested assets.
24090_14_ITEM7_P115_S0	(1) Includes $3.8 million and $6.1 million of U.S. Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprise for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
24090_14_ITEM7_P115_S1	(2) Includes $226.6 million and $292.6 million of securities guaranteed by third parties for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
24090_14_ITEM7_P116_S0	The current year decline in U.S. government-sponsored securities is due to call activity from this sector and reinvestment into fixed maturity corporate and municipal bond categories.
24090_14_ITEM7_P116_S1	The Company has increased investments in municipals primarily related to Build America taxable bonds, essential services and corporate issuer holdings in the utility sector.
24090_14_ITEM7_P117_S0	At December 31, 2013 , investments in fixed maturity and equity securities were 88.7% of our total cash, and cash equivalents and investments.
24090_14_ITEM7_P117_S1	All of our fixed maturities were classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2013 and 2012 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P117_S2	We had no fixed maturity or equity securities that were classified as trading securities at December 31, 2013 or 2012 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P118_S0	As previously discussed, our investment portfolios have been impacted significantly by the low interest rate environment over the past several years.
24090_14_ITEM7_P118_S1	The following table shows investment yields by segment operations as of December 31 for each year presented.
24090_14_ITEM7_P119_S0	Yields on investment assets vary between segment operations due to different portfolio mixes and durations in the segments.
24090_14_ITEM7_P119_S1	The life segment previously invested more in U.S. Government securities however over the past few years it has invested in municipal and corporate issuers and is now more similar to the home service segment which has had concentrations primarily in the corporate and municipal sectors.
24090_14_ITEM7_P120_S0	Credit ratings reported for the periods indicated are assigned by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ("NRSRO") such as Moody s Investors Service, Standard Poor s and Fitch Ratings.
24090_14_ITEM7_P120_S1	A credit rating assigned by a NRSRO is a quality based rating, with AAA representing the highest quality and D the lowest, with BBB and above being considered investment grade.
24090_14_ITEM7_P120_S2	In addition, the Company may use credit ratings of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") Securities Valuation Office ("SVO") as assigned, if there is no NRSRO rating.
24090_14_ITEM7_P120_S3	Securities rated by the SVO are grouped in the equivalent NRSRO category as stated by the SVO and securities that are not rated by a NRSRO are included in the "other" category.
24090_14_ITEM7_P121_S0	The following table shows the distribution of the credit ratings of our portfolio of fixed maturity securities by carrying value.
24090_14_ITEM7_P122_S0	The Company made new investments in the A and BBB credit category of taxable municipals and corporate bonds, primarily public utility issuers with an average maturity of seven years.
24090_14_ITEM7_P122_S1	Non-investment grade securities are the result of downgrades of issuers, as the Company does not purchase below investment grade securities.
24090_14_ITEM7_P123_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company held municipal securities that include third party guarantees.
24090_14_ITEM7_P123_S1	Detailed below is a presentation by NRSRO rating of our municipal holdings by funding type.
24090_14_ITEM7_P124_S0	The Company was not exposed to holding investments in any category under special revenue bond that were greater than 10% based upon activity as of December 31, 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P125_S0	The tables below represent the Company s detailed exposure of municipal holdings in Louisiana and Texas, which comprise the most significant state concentrations of the total municipal portfolio as of December 31, 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P126_S0	The Company invests in municipal securities of issuers in the state of Louisiana and receives a credit that reduces its premium tax liability in that state.
24090_14_ITEM7_P126_S1	At December 31, 2013 , total holdings of municipal securities in Louisiana represented 7.3% of all municipal holdings based upon fair value.
24090_14_ITEM7_P126_S2	The Company also holds 13.6% of its municipal holdings in Texas issuers.
24090_14_ITEM7_P127_S0	There were no other states or individual issuer holdings that represented or exceeded 10% of the total municipal portfolio as of December 31, 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P128_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of our fixed maturity and equity securities at least quarterly.
24090_14_ITEM7_P129_S0	The Company monitors all debt and equity securities on an on-going basis relative to changes in credit ratings, market prices, earnings trends and financial performance, in addition to specific region or industry reviews.
24090_14_ITEM7_P130_S0	The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on a case-by-case evaluation of underlying reasons for the decline in fair value.
24090_14_ITEM7_P131_S0	The Company determines other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) by reviewing all relevant evidence related to the specific security issuer as well as the Company's intent to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost.
24090_14_ITEM7_P132_S0	When an OTTI has occurred, the amount of the OTTI recognized in earnings depends on whether the Company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis.
24090_14_ITEM7_P132_S1	If the Company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, an OTTI is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_14_ITEM7_P132_S2	If the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Company is required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the OTTI will be separated into the following: a) the amount representing the credit loss; and b) the amount related to all other factors.
24090_14_ITEM7_P132_S3	The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings.
24090_14_ITEM7_P132_S4	The amount of the total OTTI related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_14_ITEM7_P132_S5	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_14_ITEM7_P132_S6	The new amortized cost is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value.
24090_14_ITEM7_P133_S0	There were no OTTI impairments recorded during 2013.
24090_14_ITEM7_P133_S1	We recorded an OTTI write-down in 2012 of $1,319,000 related to one coal powered energy issuer debt security holding which has a maturity date in 2017.
24090_14_ITEM7_P134_S0	The operations of this energy provider have been negatively impacted by the challenging environment in the coal-fired generation sector and overall decline in the price of power it can charge to customers.
24090_14_ITEM7_P134_S1	The Company recorded an OTTI of $70,000 in 2011 related to one American Airlines bond holding, as the issuer filed for bankruptcy.
24090_14_ITEM7_P134_S2	Based upon our emphasis on investing in fixed maturity securities primarily composed of obligations of U.S. Government-sponsored corporations and our analysis of whether declines in fair value below cost are temporary or other-than-temporary, management believes that our investments in fixed maturity investments at December 31, 2013 were not impaired, and no additional other-than-temporary losses need to be recorded.
24090_14_ITEM7_P135_S0	Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities available-for-sale amounted to $13.1 million as of December 31, 2013 and $1.1 million as of December 31, 2012 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P135_S1	This increase in gross unrealized losses was due to an increase in the interest rate environment.
24090_14_ITEM7_P135_S2	There were $0.4 million and $0.2 million of gross unrealized losses on equity securities as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P135_S3	In 2012 and 2011 , the Company sold equity mutual fund holdings from the Life and Home Service segments and recorded realized gains of $0.6 million and $1.3 million due to market recovery since impairment at December 31, 2008.
24090_14_ITEM7_P136_S0	As is customary among insurance companies, our insurance company subsidiaries reinsure with other companies portions of the life insurance risks they underwrite.
24090_14_ITEM7_P136_S1	A primary purpose of reinsurance agreements is to enable an insurance company to reduce the amount of risk on any particular life and, by reinsuring the amount exceeding the maximum amount the insurance company is willing to retain, to insure individuals in amounts larger than it could without such agreements.
24090_14_ITEM7_P136_S2	Even though a portion of the risk may be reinsured, our insurance company subsidiaries remain liable to perform all the obligations imposed by the policies issued by them and could be liable if their reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements.
24090_14_ITEM7_P137_S0	We believe we have established appropriate reinsurance coverage based upon our net retained insured liabilities compared to our surplus.
24090_14_ITEM7_P138_S0	The effect of reinsurance on premiums is as follows.
24090_14_ITEM7_P139_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries monitor the solvency of their reinsurers in seeking to minimize the risk of loss in the event of default by a reinsurer.
24090_14_ITEM7_P140_S0	The primary reinsurers of our insurance subsidiaries are large, well-capitalized entities.
24090_14_ITEM7_P141_S0	The effect of reinsurance on life insurance in force is as follows.
24090_14_ITEM7_P142_S0	Virtually all of the Company's non-credit accident and health insurance has been reinsured and is administered by Puritan Life Insurance Company of America, an unaffiliated party.
24090_14_ITEM7_P142_S1	The reinsurance recoverables under this agreement are collateralized by assets held in a trust for the benefit of the reinsured policies.
24090_14_ITEM7_P143_S0	The Company monitors the credit ratings of our life and property reinsurers.
24090_14_ITEM7_P143_S1	The ratings by A.M. Best Company range from B+ (Good) to A+ (Superior).
24090_14_ITEM7_P144_S0	SPFIC has first and second event catastrophe reinsurance coverage of $10.0 million per event and a retention level of $500,000 per event.
24090_14_ITEM7_P144_S1	Thus, the first $500,000 of incurred claims and any claims in excess of $10.0 million are SPFIC's responsibility.
24090_14_ITEM7_P145_S0	The reinsurance premium for first event catastrophe reinsurance was $1,107,000 , $1,025,000 and $1,128,000 in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
24090_14_ITEM7_P146_S0	Liquidity refers to a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the needs of its operations.
24090_14_ITEM7_P146_S1	Liquidity is managed on insurance operations to ensure stable and reliable sources of cash flows to meet obligations and is provided by a variety of sources.
24090_14_ITEM7_P147_S0	Our liquidity requirements are met primarily by funds provided from operations.
24090_14_ITEM7_P147_S1	Premium deposits and revenues, investment income and investment maturities are the primary sources of funds, while investment purchases, policy benefits, and operating expenses are the primary uses of funds.
24090_14_ITEM7_P147_S2	We historically have not had to liquidate investments to provide cash flow, and there were no liquidity issues in 2013 or 2012 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P147_S3	Our investments consist of 88.8% of marketable debt securities and 6.0% of equity securities classified as available-for-sale that could be readily converted to cash for liquidity needs.
24090_14_ITEM7_P148_S0	A primary liquidity concern is the risk of an extraordinary level of early policyholder withdrawals.
24090_14_ITEM7_P148_S1	We include provisions within our insurance policies, such as surrender charges, that help limit and discourage early withdrawals.
24090_14_ITEM7_P148_S2	Since these contractual withdrawals, as well as the level of surrenders experienced, have been largely consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management, our associated cash outflows have, historically, not had an adverse impact on our overall liquidity.
24090_14_ITEM7_P149_S0	Individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy.
24090_14_ITEM7_P149_S1	Cash flow projections and cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios are also performed annually to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy.
24090_14_ITEM7_P150_S0	We currently anticipate that available liquidity sources and future cash flows will be adequate to meet our needs for funds.
24090_14_ITEM7_P151_S0	Cash flows from our insurance operations historically have been sufficient to meet current needs.
24090_14_ITEM7_P151_S1	Cash flows from operating activities were $81.4 million , $69.3 million and $64.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
24090_14_ITEM7_P151_S2	We have traditionally also had significant cash flows from both scheduled and unscheduled fixed maturity security calls, maturities, redemptions, and prepayments, which totaled $92.7 million , $326.7 million and $283.3 million in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P151_S3	These cash flows, for the most part, are reinvested in fixed income securities.
24090_14_ITEM7_P151_S4	Net cash outflows from investment activity totaled $84.9 million , $50.0 million and $85.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
24090_14_ITEM7_P151_S5	The outflows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily related to the investment of excess cash and cash equivalents generated from operations during 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P151_S6	The Company's cash flows from financing activities were $1.7 million in 2013 , $3.8 million in 2012 and $4.3 million in 2011 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P152_S0	The NAIC has established minimum capital requirements in the form of RBC.
24090_14_ITEM7_P152_S1	RBC considers the type of business written by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company's business to develop a minimum level of capital called "Authorized Control Level Risk-based Capital" and compares this level to an adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves.
24090_14_ITEM7_P152_S2	Should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk-based capital fall below 200%, a series of remedial actions by the affected company would be required.
24090_14_ITEM7_P153_S0	At December 31, 2013 , all of our insurance subsidiaries were above the required minimum RBC levels.
24090_14_ITEM7_P154_S0	In 2013 and 2011, CICA contributed 50,000 and 150,000 shares of Citizens, Inc.
24090_14_ITEM7_P154_S1	Class A common stock to CNLIC as a capital contribution due to minimum capital and surplus considerations.
24090_14_ITEM7_P154_S2	The contributed shares had a fair market contributed value of $443 thousand and $1.2 million .
24090_14_ITEM7_P154_S3	These shares were subsequently purchased by Citizens, Inc., the ultimate parent, for $440 thousand and $1.1 million cash in 2013 and 2011, respectively.
24090_14_ITEM7_P154_S4	Citizens, Inc. also purchased Class A Common shares in 2012 from CTI with an approximate fair value of $0.5 million.
24090_14_ITEM7_P154_S5	These transactions have been eliminated under consolidation accounting rules.
24090_14_ITEM7_P155_S0	We have committed to the following contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 , with the payments due by the period indicated below:
24090_14_ITEM7_P156_S0	The payments related to the future policy benefits and policy claims payable reflected in the table above have been projected utilizing assumptions based upon our historical experience and anticipated future experience.
24090_14_ITEM7_P157_S0	The Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2013 and, therefore, does not expect any future effects on the Company's financial condition related to any such arrangements.
24090_14_ITEM7_P158_S0	We do not utilize special purpose entities as investment vehicles, nor are there any such entities in which we have an investment that engages in speculative activities of any nature, and we do not use such investments to hedge our investment positions.
24090_14_ITEM7_P159_S0	Citizens is a holding company and has had minimal operations of its own.
24090_14_ITEM7_P159_S1	Our assets consist of the capital stock of our subsidiaries, cash, fixed income securities, mutual funds and investment real estate.
24090_14_ITEM7_P159_S2	Our cash flows depend primarily upon the availability of statutorily permissible payments, primarily payments under management agreements from our two primary life insurance subsidiaries, CICA and SPLIC.
24090_14_ITEM7_P159_S3	The ability to make payments is limited by applicable laws and regulations of Colorado, CICA's state of domicile, and Louisiana, SPLIC's state of domicile, which subject insurance operations to significant regulatory restrictions.
24090_14_ITEM7_P159_S4	These laws and regulations require, among other things, that these insurance subsidiaries maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company.
24090_14_ITEM7_P160_S0	We historically have not relied upon dividends from subsidiaries for our cash flow needs.
24090_14_ITEM7_P160_S1	However, CICA and SPLIC both dividend available funds from time to time in relation to new acquisition target strategies.
24090_14_ITEM7_P161_S0	CICA has contributed amounts in the form of dividends to Citizens totaling $5.4 million and $6.8 million in 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
24090_14_ITEM7_P162_S0	Additionally, a substantial portion of our international policyholders invest their policy cash dividends and benefits in our Class A common stock through our Stock Investment Plan (the Plan ).
24090_14_ITEM7_P162_S1	Once a policyholder elects to participate in the Plan, their policy benefits can be used to purchase Citizens Class A common stock through the Plan in the open market.
24090_14_ITEM7_P162_S2	In addition, our existing holders of Class A common stock, our employees and our independent consultants are eligible to participate in the Plan.
24090_14_ITEM7_P162_S3	If fewer policyholders elect to participate in the Plan, or if our international premium collections were to decrease as a result of regulatory or marketing impediments, the trading volume of our Class A common stock may decline from its present levels.
24090_14_ITEM7_P163_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
24090_14_ITEM7_P163_S1	Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM7_P163_S2	While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available.
24090_14_ITEM7_P163_S3	Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
24090_14_ITEM7_P164_S0	Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.
24090_14_ITEM7_P165_S0	No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting policies.
24090_14_ITEM7_P166_S0	Our critical accounting policies are as follows:
24090_14_ITEM7_P167_S0	Future policy benefit reserves have been computed by the net level premium method with assumptions as to investment yields, dividends on participating business, mortality and withdrawals based upon our experience.
24090_14_ITEM7_P167_S1	The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of policy liabilities and the increase in future policy benefit reserves.
24090_14_ITEM7_P167_S2	Management's judgments and estimates for future policy benefit reserves provide for possible unfavorable deviation.
24090_14_ITEM7_P168_S0	We continue to use the original assumptions (including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation) in subsequent periods to determine the changes in the liability for future policy benefits (the "lock-in concept ) unless a premium deficiency exists.
24090_14_ITEM7_P168_S1	Management monitors these assumptions and has determined that a premium deficiency did not exist as of December 31, 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P168_S2	Management believes that our policy liabilities and increase in future policy benefit reserves as of the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 are based upon assumptions, including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation, that do not warrant revision.
24090_14_ITEM7_P169_S0	Acquisition costs, consisting of commissions and policy issuance, underwriting and agency expenses that relate to and vary with the successful production of new business, are deferred.
24090_14_ITEM7_P170_S0	estimated premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of the annual premium recognized to the total premium revenue anticipated, using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_14_ITEM7_P171_S0	We utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance.
24090_14_ITEM7_P171_S1	The factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period.
24090_14_ITEM7_P171_S2	The factor method ensures that policies which lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation.
24090_14_ITEM7_P171_S3	The factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value, provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors.
24090_14_ITEM7_P172_S0	Inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred, the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_14_ITEM7_P172_S1	Approximately 91.0% of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year excess commissions.
24090_14_ITEM7_P172_S2	The remaining 9.0% are attributed to costs that vary with and are directly related to the successful acquisition of new insurance business.
24090_14_ITEM7_P172_S3	Those costs generally include costs related to the production, underwriting and issuance of new business.
24090_14_ITEM7_P173_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_14_ITEM7_P173_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 30 years.
24090_14_ITEM7_P173_S2	The available premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated.
24090_14_ITEM7_P173_S3	The deferred policy acquisition costs are then evaluated over two methods utilizing reasonable assumptions and two other methods using pessimistic assumptions.
24090_14_ITEM7_P173_S4	The two methods using reasonable assumptions illustrate an early-deferred policy acquisition recoverability period.
24090_14_ITEM7_P173_S5	The two methods utilizing pessimistic assumptions still support early recoverability of our aggregate deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_14_ITEM7_P174_S0	Management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value.
24090_14_ITEM7_P174_S1	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on capitalized expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business, utilization of the factor method and annual recoverability testing.
24090_14_ITEM7_P175_S0	Cost of Customer Relationships Acquired ("CCRA") is established when we purchase a block of insurance.
24090_14_ITEM7_P175_S1	CCRA is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_14_ITEM7_P176_S0	We utilize various methods to determine the amount of the ending asset balance, including a static model and a dynamic model.
24090_14_ITEM7_P176_S1	Inherent in the amortization of CCRA are certain management judgments about the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_14_ITEM7_P176_S2	The assumptions used are based upon interest, mortality and lapses at the time of purchase.
24090_14_ITEM7_P177_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_14_ITEM7_P177_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next thirty years.
24090_14_ITEM7_P177_S2	The CCRA is then evaluated utilizing reasonable assumptions.
24090_14_ITEM7_P177_S3	Management believes our CCRA and related amortization is recoverable for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .
24090_14_ITEM7_P177_S4	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on estimated future results of the block and our annual recoverability testing.
24090_14_ITEM7_P178_S0	Current accounting guidance requires that goodwill balances be reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event has occurred.
24090_14_ITEM7_P179_S0	A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment on one level below an operating segment.
24090_14_ITEM7_P179_S1	Most of the Company's reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated, are equivalent to the Company's operating segment, as there is no discrete financial information available for the separate components of the segment or all of the components of the segment have similar economic characteristics.
24090_14_ITEM7_P180_S0	The goodwill impairment test follows a multi step process as defined under current accounting guidance.
24090_14_ITEM7_P180_S1	An initial review may be performed whereby the assessment is based upon a qualitative factors before performing the first test step.
24090_14_ITEM7_P181_S0	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
24090_14_ITEM7_P181_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment.
24090_14_ITEM7_P181_S2	In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value.
24090_14_ITEM7_P181_S3	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
24090_14_ITEM7_P182_S0	Management's determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations, peer company price to earnings multiples, the level of the Company's Class A common stock price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit.
24090_14_ITEM7_P182_S1	Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections.
24090_14_ITEM7_P183_S0	The evaluation of securities for impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings.
24090_14_ITEM7_P183_S1	The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition or future prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period.
24090_14_ITEM7_P184_S0	Based upon current accounting guidance, investment securities must be classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading.
24090_14_ITEM7_P184_S1	Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase.
24090_14_ITEM7_P185_S0	The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities.
24090_14_ITEM7_P185_S1	Fixed maturity securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the Company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity.
24090_14_ITEM7_P185_S2	Securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings until realized.
24090_14_ITEM7_P186_S0	The Company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if an OTTI exists pursuant to the accounting guidelines.
24090_14_ITEM7_P186_S1	In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the ability and intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
24090_14_ITEM7_P186_S2	In analyzing an issuer's financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the Federal government or its agencies, by government-sponsored agencies, or whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and reviews of the issuer's financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM7_P187_S0	If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, management must then determine the amount of OTTI to be recognized in earnings.
24090_14_ITEM7_P187_S1	If management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.
24090_14_ITEM7_P187_S2	The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.
24090_14_ITEM7_P187_S3	The amount of OTTI related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_14_ITEM7_P187_S4	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_14_ITEM7_P187_S5	If management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_14_ITEM7_P187_S6	Any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain (as other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold.
24090_14_ITEM7_P188_S0	The Company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions, future market movements, business plan changes, or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time.
24090_14_ITEM7_P189_S0	Premiums on life and accident and health policies are reported as earned when due or, for short duration contracts, over the contract period on a pro rata basis.
24090_14_ITEM7_P189_S1	Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in recognition of profits over the estimated life of the contracts.
24090_14_ITEM7_P189_S2	This matching is accomplished by means of provisions for future benefits and the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_14_ITEM7_P190_S0	Annuities are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest bearing financial instruments.
24090_14_ITEM7_P191_S0	Our primary annuity products do not include fees or other such charges.
24090_14_ITEM7_P192_S0	A deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recorded only if a determination is made that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax treatment on which the deferred tax item depends will be sustained in the event of an audit.
24090_14_ITEM7_P192_S1	These determinations inherently involve management's judgment.
24090_14_ITEM7_P192_S2	In addition, the Company must record a tax valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
24090_14_ITEM7_P192_S3	This valuation allowance is in essence a contra account to the deferred tax asset.
24090_14_ITEM7_P192_S4	Management must determine the portion of the deferred tax asset and resulting tax benefit that may not be realized based upon judgment of expected outcomes.
24090_14_ITEM7_P193_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_14_ITEM7_P193_S1	Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position.
24090_14_ITEM7_P194_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The nature of our business exposes us to market risk relative to our invested assets and policy liabilities.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Market risk is the risk of loss that may occur when changes in interest rates and public equity prices adversely affect the value of our invested assets.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Interest rate risk is our primary market risk exposure.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can affect the fair value of our investments.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio generally increases when interest rates decrease and decreases when interest rates increase.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The following table summarizes net unrealized gains and losses as of the dates indicated.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our exposure to interest rate changes results from our significant holdings of fixed maturity investments, policy loans and mortgage loans on real estate, all of which comprised over 88.9% of our cash and investment portfolio as of December 31, 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	These investments are mainly exposed to changes in U.S. Treasury rates.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Our fixed maturities investments include U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, U.S. Government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, state and municipal bonds, and corporate bonds.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Approximately 61.9% of the fixed maturities we owned at market value on December 31, 2013 are state and political subdivisions which are primarily municipal holdings.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P2_S4	These holdings are diversified over several states.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	To manage interest risk, we perform periodic projections of asset and liability cash flows to evaluate the potential sensitivity of our investments and liabilities.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We assess interest rate sensitivity on an annual basis with respect to our fixed maturities investments using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward shifts in the prevailing interest rates.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The Company performed an analysis of fair values changes using assumed 100 basis point upward shifts in interest rates, noting that the fair value of our fixed maturity investment portfolio of $828.8 million would decrease approximately $58.3 million to a fair value of $770.4 million upon a 100 basis point increase.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The following table shows the effects on the fair values of our fixed maturity investments based upon these scenarios.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	While the test scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed-income markets, it is a near-term change that illustrates the potential impact of such events.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Due to the composition of our book of insurance business, we believe it is unlikely we would encounter large surrender activity due to an interest rate increase that would force us to dispose of our fixed maturities at a loss.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Our fixed maturity portfolio is exposed to call risk as a significant portion of the current holdings are callable.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P7_S1	A decreasing interest rate environment can result in increased call activity as experienced over the past several years, and an increasing rate environment will likely result in securities being paid at their stated maturity.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P8_S0	There are no fixed maturities or other investments that we classify as trading instruments.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Approximately 73.0% of fixed maturities were held in available-for-sale and 27.0% in held-to-maturity based upon fair value at December 31, 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM7A_P8_S2	At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we had no investments in derivative instruments, subprime loans or CDOs (collateralized debt obligations).
24090_14_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Changes in the level or volatility of equity prices affect the value of equity securities we hold as investments.
24090_14_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Our equity investments portfolio represented 4.8% of our total investments at December 31, 2013 , with 95.7% invested in diversified equity and bond mutual funds.
24090_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	Reference is made to the financial statements, the notes thereto, and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm, as listed on the table of contents.
24090_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	All other schedules have been omitted as the required information is inapplicable or the information required is presented in the financial statements or the notes thereto filed elsewhere herein.
24090_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure, among other things, material information relating to our Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to our officers who certify our financial reports and to the other members of our senior management and the Board of Directors.
24090_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and our Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") are responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")).
24090_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based upon an evaluation at the end of the period, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.
24090_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management of our Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
24090_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Management assessed internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 1992 Framework("COSO").
24090_14_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on this assessment, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.
24090_14_ITEM9A_P3_S1	The report is included in item 9A(d) of this annual report.
24090_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	During 2013 , there have been no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that materially affect or are reasonably likely to affect the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.
24090_14_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Citizens, Inc.:
24090_14_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We have audited Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 1992 Framework (the COSO criteria).
24090_14_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting .
24090_14_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
24090_14_ITEM9A_P7_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
24090_14_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
24090_14_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
24090_14_ITEM9A_P7_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
24090_14_ITEM9A_P8_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
24090_14_ITEM9A_P8_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
24090_14_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
24090_14_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
24090_14_ITEM9A_P10_S0	In our opinion, Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria.
24090_14_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 of Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries and our report dated March 11, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
24090_14_ITEM9B_P0_S0	On Tuesday, March 11, 2014 , the Company issued a news release (the "Release") reporting the acquisition of Magnolia Guaranty Life Insurance Company by Security Plan Life Insurance and results for its fourth quarter and full-year 2013 earnings.

24090_14_ITEM15_P5_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
24090_14_ITEM15_P5_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
24090_14_ITEM15_P6_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
24090_14_ITEM15_P6_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

24090_14_ITEM15_P12_S0	Supplemental Disclosure of Non-Cash Investing Activities:
24090_14_ITEM15_P13_S0	In 2011, the Company sold a parcel of real estate and issued a mortgage loan for $116,000 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P14_S0	Supplemental Disclosures of Non-Cash Financing Activities:
24090_14_ITEM15_P15_S0	In 2012, the Company made a cashless exercise of expiring warrants and issued Class A common shares totaling 13,606 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P16_S0	In 2011, the Company made a cashless exercise of expiring warrants and issued Class A common shares totaling 1,989 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P17_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
24090_14_ITEM15_P18_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Citizens, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP").
24090_14_ITEM15_P19_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of Citizens, Inc. ("Citizens"), a Colorado corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, CICA Life Insurance Company of America ("CICA"), Citizens National Life Insurance Company ("CNLIC"), Security Plan Life Insurance Company ("SPLIC"), Security Plan Fire Insurance Company ("SPFIC"), Computing Technology, Inc. ("CTI"), and Insurance Investors, Inc. ("III").
24090_14_ITEM15_P19_S1	All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
24090_14_ITEM15_P20_S0	We provide primarily life insurance, as well as a small amount of health insurance policies, through three of our subsidiaries - CICA, SPLIC, and CNLIC.
24090_14_ITEM15_P20_S1	CICA and CNLIC issue ordinary whole-life policies, burial insurance, pre-need policies, and accident and health related policies throughout the Midwest and southern United States.
24090_14_ITEM15_P20_S2	CICA also issues ordinary whole-life policies to non-U.S. residents.
24090_14_ITEM15_P21_S0	SPLIC offers final expense and home service life insurance in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, and SPFIC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SPLIC, writes a limited amount of property insurance in Louisiana.
24090_14_ITEM15_P22_S0	CTI provides data processing systems and services, as well as furniture and equipment, to the Company.
24090_14_ITEM15_P23_S0	III provides aviation transportation to the Company.
24090_14_ITEM15_P24_S0	Investment securities are classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading.
24090_14_ITEM15_P24_S1	Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase.
24090_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities.
24090_14_ITEM15_P25_S1	Fixed maturity securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the Company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity.
24090_14_ITEM15_P25_S2	Securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings until realized.
24090_14_ITEM15_P26_S0	Fixed maturities consist primarily of bonds classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.
24090_14_ITEM15_P26_S1	The Company does not classify any fixed maturities as trading.
24090_14_ITEM15_P26_S2	Equity securities (including non-redeemable preferred stock) are considered available-for-sale and are reported at fair value.
24090_14_ITEM15_P27_S0	Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of equity securities and fixed maturities held as available-for-sale is shown as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of tax, and is a separate component of comprehensive income.
24090_14_ITEM15_P28_S0	The Company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if an other-than-temporary impairment ("OTTI") exists pursuant to the accounting guidelines.
24090_14_ITEM15_P28_S1	In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the ability and intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
24090_14_ITEM15_P28_S2	In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the Federal government or its agencies, by government-sponsored agencies, or whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and reviews of the issuer s financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM15_P29_S0	If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, management must then determine the amount of OTTI to be recognized in earnings.
24090_14_ITEM15_P29_S1	If management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.
24090_14_ITEM15_P29_S2	The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.
24090_14_ITEM15_P30_S0	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_14_ITEM15_P30_S1	If management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_14_ITEM15_P30_S2	Any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain (as other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold.
24090_14_ITEM15_P31_S0	The Company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions, future market movements, business plan changes, or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time.
24090_14_ITEM15_P32_S0	Mortgage loans on real estate and policy loans are reported at unpaid principal balances.
24090_14_ITEM15_P33_S0	Real estate and other long-term investments consist primarily of land and buildings that are recorded at depreciated cost.
24090_14_ITEM15_P33_S1	If the fair value of the real estate is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized and charged to earnings.
24090_14_ITEM15_P34_S0	Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method.
24090_14_ITEM15_P35_S0	Dividend and interest income is recognized when earned.
24090_14_ITEM15_P35_S1	Realized gains and losses are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold.
24090_14_ITEM15_P36_S0	The Company had cash equivalents and fixed maturities with an aggregate fair value of $9.3 million and $10.2 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, on deposit with various state regulatory authorities to fulfill statutory requirements.
24090_14_ITEM15_P37_S0	Premiums on life policies are recognized as earned when due.
24090_14_ITEM15_P37_S1	Due premiums on the balance sheet are net of allowances.
24090_14_ITEM15_P38_S0	Accident and health policies are recognized as revenue over the contract period on a pro rata basis.
24090_14_ITEM15_P38_S1	Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in the recognition of profits over the estimated lives of the contracts.
24090_14_ITEM15_P38_S2	This matching is accomplished by means of a provision for future policy benefits and the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_14_ITEM15_P39_S0	Annuity policies, primarily flexible premium fixed annuity products, are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest bearing financial instruments.
24090_14_ITEM15_P39_S1	Premium receipts are not reported as revenue, rather as deposit liabilities to annuity contracts.
24090_14_ITEM15_P39_S2	The annuity products issued do not include fees or other such charges.
24090_14_ITEM15_P40_S0	Acquisition costs, consisting of commissions and policy issuance, underwriting and agent convention expenses that are primarily related to and vary with the successful production of new and renewal business, have been deferred.
24090_14_ITEM15_P40_S1	These deferred amounts, referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC"), are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and amortized to income in a systematic manner, based on related contract revenues or gross profits as appropriate.
24090_14_ITEM15_P41_S0	Traditional life insurance and accident and health insurance acquisition costs are being amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing future policy benefit liabilities.
24090_14_ITEM15_P41_S1	For universal life type contracts and investment contracts that include significant surrender charges or that yield significant revenues from sources other than the investment contract holders' funds, the deferred contract acquisition cost amortization is matched to the recognition of gross profit.
24090_14_ITEM15_P41_S2	The effect on the DAC asset that would result from realization of unrealized gains or losses is recognized with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income in consolidated stockholders' equity.
24090_14_ITEM15_P42_S0	If an internal replacement of insurance or investment contract modification substantially changes a contract as defined in current accounting guidance, then the DAC is written off immediately through income and any new deferrable costs associated with the new replacement are deferred.
24090_14_ITEM15_P42_S1	If a contract modification does not substantially change the contract, the DAC amortization on the original contract will continue and any acquisition costs associated with the related modification are immediately expensed.
24090_14_ITEM15_P43_S0	We utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance.
24090_14_ITEM15_P43_S1	The factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period.
24090_14_ITEM15_P43_S2	The factor method ensures that policies lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation.
24090_14_ITEM15_P43_S3	The factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value, provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors.
24090_14_ITEM15_P44_S0	Inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred, the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_14_ITEM15_P44_S1	Approximately 91% of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year and renewal excess commissions.
24090_14_ITEM15_P44_S2	The remaining 9% are attributed to costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new insurance business.
24090_14_ITEM15_P44_S3	Those costs generally include costs related to the production, underwriting and issuance of new business.
24090_14_ITEM15_P45_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_14_ITEM15_P45_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less the benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 30 years.
24090_14_ITEM15_P45_S2	The available premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated.
24090_14_ITEM15_P45_S3	The deferred policy acquisition costs are then evaluated over two methods utilizing reasonable assumptions and two other methods using pessimistic assumptions.
24090_14_ITEM15_P46_S0	Management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value.
24090_14_ITEM15_P46_S1	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on capitalized expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business, utilization of the factor method and annual recoverability testing.
24090_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	The components of deferred acquisition costs from year to year are summarized as follows:
24090_14_ITEM15_P48_S0	Cost of customer relationships acquired ("CCRA") is established when we purchase a block of insurance.
24090_14_ITEM15_P48_S1	CCRA is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_14_ITEM15_P49_S0	We utilize various methods to determine the amount of the ending asset balance, including a static model and a dynamic model.
24090_14_ITEM15_P49_S1	Inherent in the amortization of CCRA are certain management judgments about the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_14_ITEM15_P49_S2	The assumptions used are based upon interest, mortality and lapses at the time of purchase.
24090_14_ITEM15_P50_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_14_ITEM15_P50_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less the benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next thirty years.
24090_14_ITEM15_P50_S2	The CCRA is then evaluated utilizing reasonable assumptions.
24090_14_ITEM15_P50_S3	Management believes that our CCRA and related amortization is recoverable for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P50_S4	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on estimated future results of the block and our annual recoverability testing.
24090_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	Cost of customer relationships acquired relative to purchased blocks of insurance is summarized as follows:
24090_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	Estimated amortization of cost of customer relationship acquired in each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows.
24090_14_ITEM15_P52_S1	Actual future amortization will differ from these estimates due to variances from estimated future withdrawal assumptions.
24090_14_ITEM15_P53_S0	The value of CCRA in our various acquisitions, which is included in cost of customer relationships acquired in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, was determined based on the present value of future profits discounted at annual rates ranging from 4.5% to 8.5% .
24090_14_ITEM15_P54_S0	Future policy benefit reserves for traditional life insurance and accident and health insurance contract benefits and expenses are computed using a net level premium method, with assumptions as to investment yields, dividends on participating business, mortality and withdrawals based upon our experience, modified as necessary to reflect anticipated trends and to include provisions for possible unfavorable deviations.
24090_14_ITEM15_P55_S0	The accrued account balance for non-traditional life insurance and investment contracts is computed as deposits net of withdrawals made by the contract holder, plus amounts credited based on contract specifications, less contract fees and charges assessed, plus any additional interest.
24090_14_ITEM15_P55_S1	Annuity interest crediting rates range from 3.0% to 5.5% annually.
24090_14_ITEM15_P55_S2	Benefits and expenses are charged against the account balance to recognize costs as incurred over the estimated lives of the contracts.
24090_14_ITEM15_P55_S3	Expenses include interest credited to contract account balances and benefits paid in excess of contract account balances.
24090_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	Unpaid claims on accident and health policies represent the estimated liability for benefit expenses, both reported but not paid and incurred but not reported to the Company.
24090_14_ITEM15_P56_S1	Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated using individual case basis valuations and statistical analyses.
24090_14_ITEM15_P56_S2	Those estimates are subject to the effects of trends in claim severity and frequency.
24090_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	Anticipated investment income is not considered in determining whether a premium deficiency exists with respect to short-duration contracts.
24090_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	Premium deposits accrue interest at rates ranging from 4.0% to 8.25% per annum.
24090_14_ITEM15_P58_S1	The cost of insurance is included in the premium when collected and interest is credited annually to deposit accounts.
24090_14_ITEM15_P59_S0	The development of liabilities for future policy benefits requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding mortality, morbidity, lapse, expense, and investment experience.
24090_14_ITEM15_P59_S1	These estimates are based primarily on historical experience and future expectations of mortality, morbidity, expense, persistency, and investment assumptions.
24090_14_ITEM15_P59_S2	Actual results could differ materially from estimates.
24090_14_ITEM15_P59_S3	We monitor actual experience and revise assumptions as necessary.
24090_14_ITEM15_P60_S0	Goodwill is the difference between the purchase price in a business combination and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, and is not amortized.
24090_14_ITEM15_P60_S1	Other intangible assets include various state insurance licenses, which have been determined to have indefinite useful lives and, therefore, are not amortized.
24090_14_ITEM15_P60_S2	Both goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are subject to annual impairment analyses.
24090_14_ITEM15_P61_S0	The goodwill impairment test uses a two step process as set forth under current accounting guidance.
24090_14_ITEM15_P61_S1	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
24090_14_ITEM15_P61_S2	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment.
24090_14_ITEM15_P61_S3	In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value.
24090_14_ITEM15_P61_S4	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
24090_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	Management's determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations, peer company price to earnings multiples, the level of the Company's Class A common stock price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit.
24090_14_ITEM15_P62_S1	Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections.
24090_14_ITEM15_P63_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company had goodwill of $12.6 million allocated to the Life Insurance segment and $4.5 million allocated to the Home Service Insurance segment.
24090_14_ITEM15_P63_S1	The Company completes its annual goodwill assessment for the individual reporting units within the Life Insurance segment and Home Service Insurance segment as of December 31 each year.
24090_14_ITEM15_P63_S2	There was no impairment of goodwill in 2013 , 2012 or 2011 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , participating business approximated 60.7% and 60.8% , respectively, of direct life insurance in force.
24090_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	Future policy benefits on participating policies are estimated based on net level premium reserves for death and endowment policy benefits with interest rates ranging from 3% to 8% , and the cash surrender values described in such contracts.
24090_14_ITEM15_P65_S1	The scaling rate used for the 2013 portfolio ranged between 3.7% for 2 years and then going up to 5% over 15 years and remaining there for the duration.
24090_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	Earnings and dividends on participating policies are allocated based on policies in force.
24090_14_ITEM15_P67_S0	Policyholder dividends are determined based on the discretion of the Board of Directors of the policy issuing subsidiary.
24090_14_ITEM15_P67_S1	Policyholder dividends are accrued over the premium paying periods of the insurance contract.
24090_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.
24090_14_ITEM15_P68_S1	Diluted earnings per share are computed under the if-converted method for convertible securities and the treasury stock method for warrants, giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock, including options, warrants and convertible/redeemable preferred stock.
24090_14_ITEM15_P68_S2	The basic and diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock are one half the earnings per share of the Class A common stock.
24090_14_ITEM15_P69_S0	During 2011, the warrants associated with the Series A-1 Preferred Stock were either exercised or expired on July 12, 2011 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P69_S1	Shares issued from the exercise of warrants totaled 255,216 , and 1,989 common Class A shares were issued under a cashless provision in the Preferred Stock contract.
24090_14_ITEM15_P69_S2	Additionally, 9,487 shares were issued from the exercise of warrants at various dates in 2011.
24090_14_ITEM15_P69_S3	During 2012, the warrants associated with the Series A-2 Preferred Stock were either exercised or expired.
24090_14_ITEM15_P69_S4	Shares issued from the exercise of warrants totaled 113,057 and 13,606 common Class A shares were issued under a cashless provision in the Preferred Stock contract.
24090_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
24090_14_ITEM15_P71_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
24090_14_ITEM15_P71_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered.
24090_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	A deferred tax asset is recorded only if a determination is made that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax treatment on which the deferred tax asset depends will be sustained in the event of an audit.
24090_14_ITEM15_P72_S1	These determinations inherently involve management's judgment.
24090_14_ITEM15_P72_S2	In addition, the Company must record a tax valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
24090_14_ITEM15_P72_S3	This valuation allowance is in essence a contra account to the deferred tax asset.
24090_14_ITEM15_P72_S4	Management must determine the portion of the deferred tax asset and resulting tax benefit that may not be realized based upon judgment of expected outcomes.
24090_14_ITEM15_P73_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_14_ITEM15_P73_S1	Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position.
24090_14_ITEM15_P74_S0	Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
24090_14_ITEM15_P74_S1	Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to thirty years.
24090_14_ITEM15_P75_S0	We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated life of the improvements.
24090_14_ITEM15_P75_S1	The Company has no capital leases.
24090_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	The following is a summary of property and equipment.
24090_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	Reinsurance recoverable includes expected reimbursements for policyholder claim amounts in excess of the Company's retention, as well as profit sharing and experience refund accruals.
24090_14_ITEM15_P77_S1	Reinsurance recoverable is reduced for estimated uncollectible amounts, if any.
24090_14_ITEM15_P78_S0	Reinsurance premiums, losses and adjustment expenses are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts.
24090_14_ITEM15_P78_S1	The cost of reinsurance related to long duration contracts is accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies.

24090_14_ITEM15_P88_S1	Under ASU 2013-02, the type of reclassification out of accumulated other comprehensive income, as defined under current GAAP, will dictate whether the disclosure must provide the effect of the reclassification on the respective financial statement line items or whether cross-referencing to other disclosures that provide additional detail about the reclassification will be required.
24090_14_ITEM15_P88_S2	The amendments in ASU 2013-02 are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012.

24090_14_ITEM15_P95_S0	The available-for-sale fixed maturities in a gross unrealized loss position for more than 12 months is primarily related to rises in interest rates which results in lower market prices on fixed maturity securities that have lower coupons than the current market rate.
24090_14_ITEM15_P95_S1	This is interest rate risk and is not a signal of impairment.
24090_14_ITEM15_P95_S2	Management has completed its assessment of other-than-temporary impairment of these securities.
24090_14_ITEM15_P95_S3	Based on our evaluation of the credit worthiness of the issuers and because we do not intend to sell the investments, nor is it likely that we would be required to sell these investments, before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, none of the unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporary.
24090_14_ITEM15_P96_S0	We monitor all debt and equity securities on an on-going basis relative to changes in credit ratings, market prices, earnings trends and financial performance, in addition to specific region or industry reviews.
24090_14_ITEM15_P96_S1	Our impairment review, in accordance with current guidance, is performed by the Company at each reporting date and management uses its best judgment to decide if impairment is other-than-temporary.
24090_14_ITEM15_P96_S2	We determine other-than-temporary impairment by reviewing relevant evidence related to the specific security issuer, as well as our intent to sell the security or whether we more likely than not will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery.
24090_14_ITEM15_P97_S0	All securities with a market price below par were segregated and reviewed as of December 31, 2013 based upon the items above for impairment.

24090_14_ITEM15_P110_S0	The Company had realized gains of $199,000 from calls of held-to-maturity fixed maturities in 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P111_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
24090_14_ITEM15_P111_S1	We hold fixed maturity and equity securities that are carried at fair value.
24090_14_ITEM15_P112_S0	Fair value measurements are generally based upon observable and unobservable inputs.
24090_14_ITEM15_P112_S1	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.
24090_14_ITEM15_P112_S2	We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
24090_14_ITEM15_P113_S0	All assets and liabilities carried at fair value are required to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
24090_14_ITEM15_P114_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
24090_14_ITEM15_P115_S0	Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose inputs or whose significant value drivers are observable.
24090_14_ITEM15_P116_S0	Level 3 - Instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable.
24090_14_ITEM15_P117_S0	Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as U.S. Treasury securities, publicly traded mutual fund investments and individual stocks.
24090_14_ITEM15_P118_S0	Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued by independent pricing services or broker quotes.
24090_14_ITEM15_P118_S1	These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various inputs, such as interest rates, credit spreads and foreign exchange rates for the underlying financial instruments.
24090_14_ITEM15_P118_S2	All significant inputs are observable, or derived from observable information in the marketplace or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
24090_14_ITEM15_P119_S0	Financial instruments in this category primarily include corporate fixed maturity securities, U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise securities, municipal securities and certain mortgage and asset-backed securities.
24090_14_ITEM15_P120_S0	Level 3 is comprised of financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on non-binding broker prices utilizing significant inputs not based on, or corroborated by, readily available market information.
24090_14_ITEM15_P120_S1	This category consists of two private placement mortgage-backed securities where we cannot corroborate the significant valuation inputs with market observable data.
24090_14_ITEM15_P121_S0	The following table sets forth our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the date indicated.
24090_14_ITEM15_P122_S0	At December 31, 2013 , the fixed maturities, valued using a third-party pricing source, totaled $592.5 million for Level 2 assets and comprised 90.8% of total reported fair value.
24090_14_ITEM15_P122_S1	Fair values for Level 3 assets are based upon unadjusted broker quotes that are non-binding.
24090_14_ITEM15_P123_S0	The Level 1 and Level 2 valuations are reviewed and validated quarterly through random testing by comparisons to separate pricing models, other third party pricing services, and back tested to recent trades.
24090_14_ITEM15_P123_S1	In addition, we obtain information relative to the third party pricing models and review model parameters for reasonableness.
24090_14_ITEM15_P123_S2	For the period ended December 31, 2013 , there were no material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine fair values, and no broker or third party prices were changed from the values received.
24090_14_ITEM15_P124_S0	There were no transfers made between level 1 and 2 securities at December 31, 2013 or 2012 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P125_S0	Fair values of these securities are based upon quoted market price and are classified as Level 1 assets.
24090_14_ITEM15_P126_S0	The following table presents additional information about fixed maturity securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and for which we have utilized significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs to determine fair value:
24090_14_ITEM15_P127_S0	We review the fair value hierarchy classifications each reporting period.
24090_14_ITEM15_P128_S0	Changes in the observability of the valuation attributes may result in a reclassification of certain financial assets.
24090_14_ITEM15_P128_S1	Such reclassifications, if any, are reported as transfers in and out of Level 3 at the beginning fair value for the reporting period in which the changes occur.
24090_14_ITEM15_P129_S0	Estimates of fair values are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market prices and information about the financial instrument.
24090_14_ITEM15_P129_S1	The estimated fair values of financial instruments presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company might realize in actual market transactions.
24090_14_ITEM15_P129_S2	The carrying amount and fair value for the financial assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at each year-end were as follows:
24090_14_ITEM15_P130_S0	Fair values for fixed income securities, which are characterized as Level 2 assets in the fair value hierarchy, are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar securities.
24090_14_ITEM15_P130_S1	In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other assumptions, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.
24090_14_ITEM15_P131_S0	Mortgage loans are secured principally by residential properties and commercial properties.
24090_14_ITEM15_P131_S1	Weighted average interest rates for these loans were approximately 6.4% and 6.6% per year, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, with maturities ranging from 2 to 29 years.
24090_14_ITEM15_P131_S2	Management estimated the fair value using an annual interest rate of 6.25% at December 31, 2013 and 2012 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P131_S3	Our mortgage loans are considered Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_14_ITEM15_P132_S0	Policy loans have a weighted average annual interest rate of 7.7% as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, and have no specified maturity dates.
24090_14_ITEM15_P133_S0	These loans typically carry an interest rate that is tied to the crediting rate applied to the related policy and contract reserves.
24090_14_ITEM15_P134_S0	Policy loans are an integral part of the life insurance policies that we have in force and cannot be valued separately and are not marketable.
24090_14_ITEM15_P134_S1	Therefore, the fair value approximates the carrying value and policy loans are considered Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_14_ITEM15_P135_S0	The fair value of short-term investments approximate carrying value due to their short-term nature.
24090_14_ITEM15_P135_S1	Our short-term investments are considered Level 2 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_14_ITEM15_P136_S0	The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximate carrying value and are characterized as Level 1 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_14_ITEM15_P137_S0	The fair value of the Company's liabilities under annuity contract policies, which are considered Level 3 assets, was estimated at December 31, 2013 using discounted cash flows based upon a swap rate curve with interest rates ranging from 0.1% to 3.8% based upon swap rates adjusted for various risk adjustments.
24090_14_ITEM15_P137_S1	The fair value of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in the overall management of interest rate risk, which seeks to minimize exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment maturities with amounts due under insurance contracts.
24090_14_ITEM15_P138_S0	Various assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit reserves of life insurance include the following: a) valuation interest rates from 4% to 9% per year; b) mortality assumptions are from the 1955 to 1960, 1965 to 1970, 1975 to 1980 and 2001 Select and Ultimate mortality tables; and c) withdrawals are based primarily on actual historical termination rates.
24090_14_ITEM15_P139_S0	The following table presents information on changes in the liability for life, accident and health and property policy and contract claims for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P140_S0	The Company experienced favorable development of $0.4 million in 2013 , primarily related to CICA.
24090_14_ITEM15_P141_S0	The favorable developments in 2012 and 2011 of $700,000 and $1,600,000 were primarily related the release of higher claim reserves in SPLIC due to longer claim reporting lags following Hurricane s Katrina and Rita and the relocation of insured lives.
24090_14_ITEM15_P141_S1	The claims related to these events have stabilized and the higher claim reserves are no longer deemed necessary.
24090_14_ITEM15_P142_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company reinsures portions of certain policies that we underwrite to limit disproportionate risks.
24090_14_ITEM15_P142_S1	During 2013 and 2012 , we retained varying amounts of individual insurance up to a maximum retention of $100,000 on any life.

24090_14_ITEM15_P144_S1	We obtain reinsurance from multiple reinsurers, and we monitor concentration as well as financial strength ratings of our principal reinsurers.
24090_14_ITEM15_P144_S2	The ratings by A.M. Best Company range from B+ (Good) to A+ (Superior).
24090_14_ITEM15_P145_S0	To protect our position, we have established and funded a trust to cover the contingent liabilities related to accident and health reinsurance ceded to Puritan Life Insurance Company of America, which represents $2.6 million of the $4.4 million of reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P146_S0	Assumed and ceded life reinsurance activity as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 is summarized as follows:

24090_14_ITEM15_P151_S0	The table below shows the combined total of all of our insurance subsidiaries' capital and surplus and net income (loss) for life insurance operations and property insurance operations, although these amounts are not all available as dividends to Citizens, Inc., because only CICA is directly owned by Citizens, Inc.
24090_14_ITEM15_P151_S1	All other subsidiaries are owned by CICA.
24090_14_ITEM15_P152_S0	Generally, the net assets of the insurance subsidiaries available for transfer to their immediate parent are limited to the greater of the subsidiary net gain from operations during the preceding year or 10% of the subsidiary net statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_14_ITEM15_P152_S1	Under these practices, total surplus at December 31, 2013 was $54.8 million and net gain from operations was $3.2 million for CICA.

24090_14_ITEM15_P156_S1	The change in fair value of warrants was reported as a component of revenue in the income statement.
24090_14_ITEM15_P156_S2	The change in fair value of warrants for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 caused an increase in revenues of $0.5 million and $1.1 million , respectively.
24090_14_ITEM15_P157_S0	We are a defendant in a lawsuit filed on August 6, 1999 , in the Texas District Court, Austin, Texas, now styled Delia Bolanos Andrade, et al., Plaintiffs, v. Citizens Insurance Company of America, et al., Defendants in which a class was originally certified by the trial court and reversed by the Texas Supreme Court in 2007 with an order to the trial court to conduct further proceedings consistent with its ruling.
24090_14_ITEM15_P157_S1	The underlying lawsuit alleged that certain life insurance policies CICA made available to non-U.S. residents, when combined with a policy feature that allowed certain cash benefits to be assigned to two non-U.S. trusts for the purpose of accumulating ownership of our Class A common stock, along with allowing the policyholders to make additional contributions to the trusts, were actually offers and sales of securities that occurred in Texas by unregistered dealers in violation of the Texas securities laws.
24090_14_ITEM15_P157_S2	The remedy sought was rescission and return of the insurance premium payments.
24090_14_ITEM15_P157_S3	On December 9, 2009 , the trial court denied the recertification of the class after conducting additional proceedings in accordance with the Texas Supreme Court's ruling.
24090_14_ITEM15_P157_S4	The remaining plaintiffs must now proceed individually, and not as a class, if they intend to pursue their claims against us.
24090_14_ITEM15_P157_S5	Since the December 9, 2009 trial court ruling, no individual cases have been further pursued by the plaintiffs.
24090_14_ITEM15_P157_S6	The probability of the plaintiffs further pursuing their cases individually is unknown.
24090_14_ITEM15_P157_S7	An estimate of any possible loss or range of losses cannot be made at this time in regard to individuals pursuing claims.
24090_14_ITEM15_P157_S8	However, should the plaintiffs further pursue their claims individually, we intend to vigorously defend any proceedings.
24090_14_ITEM15_P158_S0	In 2007 and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the Attorney General for the State of Louisiana filed suit against SPFIC and every other homeowner insurer doing business in the State of Louisiana, on behalf of the State of Louisiana and certain Road Home fund recipients.
24090_14_ITEM15_P158_S1	On July 18, 2013 , a full and final settlement was reached between SPFIC and the State of Louisiana resolving all claims against SPFIC in the Road Home matter for approximately $183,000 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P158_S2	This amount did not have a material impact on the consolidated financials.
24090_14_ITEM15_P159_S0	The Company is currently performing an internal audit related to unclaimed property for all legal reporting entities.
24090_14_ITEM15_P159_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company had been informed by the Louisiana Department of Treasury, Arkansas Auditor of State and the Texas State Comptroller, that they authorized an audit of Citizens, Inc. and its affiliates for compliance with unclaimed property laws.
24090_14_ITEM15_P159_S2	This audit is being conducted by Verus Financial LLC on behalf of the states.
24090_14_ITEM15_P159_S3	These internal and external audits may result in additional payments to beneficiaries, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws, administrative penalties, interest, and changes to the Company's procedures for the identification and escheatment of abandoned property.
24090_14_ITEM15_P159_S4	At this time, the Company is not able to estimate any of these possible amounts, but such costs could be substantial for a company our size.
24090_14_ITEM15_P160_S0	However, in doing so, we could incur significant defense costs, including attorneys' fees, other direct litigation costs and the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_14_ITEM15_P160_S1	If we suffer an adverse judgment as a result of litigation claims, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_14_ITEM15_P161_S0	We have the following lease commitments as of December 31, 2013 with the payments due by the periods indicated below.
24090_14_ITEM15_P162_S0	Operating lease expense was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , and $0.6 million and $0.5 million for the same periods ended 2012 and 2011 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P163_S0	The Company has three reportable segments: Life Insurance, Home Service Insurance, and Other Non-Insurance Enterprises.
24090_14_ITEM15_P163_S1	The accounting policies of the segments are in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are the same as those described in the summary of significant account policies.
24090_14_ITEM15_P164_S0	We evaluate profit and loss performance based on U.S. GAAP net income before federal income taxes for our three reportable segments.
24090_14_ITEM15_P165_S0	The Company has no reportable differences between segments and consolidated operations.
24090_14_ITEM15_P166_S0	The table below summarizes assets by segment.
24090_14_ITEM15_P167_S0	Major categories of earned premiums are summarized as follows:
24090_14_ITEM15_P168_S0	The following table sets forth the Company's annual total of earned premiums from geographic area for the years indicated:
24090_14_ITEM15_P169_S0	Our federal income tax expense was $2.1 million , $1.5 million and $2.8 million in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
24090_14_ITEM15_P169_S1	This represents effective tax rates of 30.8% , 25.0% and 25.1% , respectively.
24090_14_ITEM15_P169_S2	The Company previously had a valuation allowance related to OTTI writedowns on stocks and stock mutual funds in 2008.
24090_14_ITEM15_P169_S3	Due to the sale of these mutual funds in 2009 and 2010, the valuation allowance was released in its entirety in 2009 and 2010.
24090_14_ITEM15_P169_S4	Part of this valuation allowance was released to other comprehensive income ("OCI") in 2009 due to the increase in fair value of mutual funds and stocks still owned.
24090_14_ITEM15_P169_S5	As the stocks and mutual funds have been disposed of since 2009, this valuation allowance has been released as reductions of tax expense.
24090_14_ITEM15_P169_S6	During 2013, 2012 and 2011, $20,000 , and $188,000 and $570,000 has been released as a reduction of tax expense, respectively.
24090_14_ITEM15_P170_S0	The table below summarizes the changes in the valuation allowance.
24090_14_ITEM15_P171_S0	A reconciliation of federal income tax expense computed by applying the federal income tax rate of 35% in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 to income (loss) before federal income tax expense is as follows:
24090_14_ITEM15_P172_S0	Income tax expense (benefit) consists of:
24090_14_ITEM15_P173_S0	Deferred tax expense is comprised of $3,713,000 deferred tax benefit and $20,000 tax benefit released from OCI.
24090_14_ITEM15_P174_S0	The components of deferred federal income taxes are as follows:
24090_14_ITEM15_P175_S0	A summary of the changes in the components of deferred federal and state income taxes is as follows:
24090_14_ITEM15_P176_S0	The Company and our subsidiaries had net operating losses at December 31, 2013 available to offset future taxable income of approximately $7,521,000 , expiring at various times through 2029.
24090_14_ITEM15_P176_S1	A portion of the net operating loss carryforward is subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
24090_14_ITEM15_P177_S0	At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we determined that as a result of our historical income, projected future income, tax planning strategies, and the nature of the items from which the deferred tax assets are derived, other than assets for which OTTI was recorded, it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized.
24090_14_ITEM15_P178_S0	The Company has sufficient unrealized gains in its available-for-sale portfolio so as not to need a valuation allowance for OTTI writedowns.
24090_14_ITEM15_P179_S0	The Company and our subsidiaries had no capital loss carry-forwards at December 31, 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P180_S0	This is a special memorandum tax account into which certain amounts not previously taxed, under prior tax laws, were accumulated.
24090_14_ITEM15_P180_S1	No new additions are expected to be made to this account.
24090_14_ITEM15_P181_S0	payable thereon at the then current tax rate (a) when and if distributions to shareholders, other than stock dividends and other limited exceptions, are made in excess of the accumulated previously taxed income; or (b) when a company ceases to be a life insurance company as defined by the Internal Revenue Code and such termination is not due to another life insurance company acquiring its assets in a nontaxable transaction.
24090_14_ITEM15_P182_S0	We do not anticipate any transactions that would cause any part of this amount to become taxable.
24090_14_ITEM15_P182_S1	However, should the balance at December 31, 2013 become taxable, the tax computed at present rates would be approximately $1,152,000 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P183_S0	The Company recognizes only the impact of tax positions that, based on their technical merits, are more likely than not to be sustained upon an audit by the taxing authority.
24090_14_ITEM15_P184_S0	A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
24090_14_ITEM15_P185_S0	None of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2013 would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.
24090_14_ITEM15_P186_S0	The Company s practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
24090_14_ITEM15_P186_S1	The Company has not recorded immaterial interest or penalties with respect to any unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2013 .

24090_14_ITEM15_P189_S0	The method of allocation among companies is subject to a written tax sharing agreement, approved by the Board of Directors, whereby allocation is made primarily on a separate return basis with current credit for any net operating losses or other items utilized in the consolidated tax return.
24090_14_ITEM15_P190_S0	Intercompany tax balances are settled quarterly.
24090_14_ITEM15_P191_S0	The Company and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction and various U.S. states.
24090_14_ITEM15_P191_S1	Most of our subsidiaries are not subject to examination by U.S. tax authorities for years prior to 2010.
24090_14_ITEM15_P191_S2	Some of our subsidiaries have open tax years going back as far as 2002 due to net operating loss carry-forwards.
24090_14_ITEM15_P192_S0	The changes in the components of other comprehensive income (loss) are reported net of the effects of income taxes of 35% in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , as indicated below.

24090_14_ITEM15_P193_S4	The plan does not permit employee contributions.
24090_14_ITEM15_P194_S0	The Company is primarily self-insured for employee health benefits.
24090_14_ITEM15_P194_S1	The Company records its self-insurance liability based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.
24090_14_ITEM15_P194_S2	There is stop-loss coverage for amounts in excess of $100,000 per individual per year.
24090_14_ITEM15_P194_S3	If more claims are made than were estimated or if the costs of actual claims increase beyond what was anticipated, reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional accruals may be required in future periods.
24090_14_ITEM15_P195_S0	The Company sponsors the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan (the "Plan"), which is administered by an independent third party.

24090_14_ITEM15_P196_S1	These transactions were eliminated for financial reporting purposes in accordance with consolidation accounting, but generated a tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 totaling approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million .
24090_14_ITEM15_P197_S0	In 2012 , CICA made a return of capital of $5.4 million , to Citizens, Inc. and SPLIC paid a dividend to CICA in the amount of $2.3 million .

24090_14_ITEM15_P227_S0	Citizens, Inc. Subsidiary, Security Plan Life, completes purchase of Magnolia Guaranty Life Insurance Company and Citizens, Inc.
24090_14_ITEM15_P228_S0	Citizens, Inc. (NYSE: CIA) - Subsidiary Security Plan Life completed the purchase of Magnolia Guaranty Life Insurance Company and Citizens, Inc. reported results today for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P229_S0	On March 7, 2014, Citizens, Inc. subsidiary, Security Plan Life Insurance Company ( Security Plan ), completed its acquisition of Magnolia Guaranty Life Insurance Company ( Magnolia ) of Ridgeland, Mississippi, for $5.23 million.
24090_14_ITEM15_P229_S1	Security Plan paid cash in exchange for 409,553 shares of Magnolia capital stock outstanding.
24090_14_ITEM15_P229_S2	In response to receiving the Mississippi Department of Insurance order approving the transaction, Rick D. Riley, CEO of Security Plan, said, This Security Plan Life acquisition complements our home service segment.
24090_14_ITEM15_P229_S3	Magnolia customarily sells policies through independent funeral homes while Security Plan customarily sells through a debit route-based system.
24090_14_ITEM15_P229_S4	Together, we anticipate Mississippi clients will experience enhanced support from the affiliated companies.
24090_14_ITEM15_P230_S0	Rick D. Riley, Vice Chairman and President, said, Our 2013 results are in line with expectations which are reflective of our past experience in our market niche and traditional product foundations.
24090_14_ITEM15_P230_S1	The low interest rate environment continues to impact our results and our industry as investment yields are an integral component of our business operations.
24090_14_ITEM15_P230_S2	For the year, our consolidated insurance premiums increased 3.7% , driven largely by continued growth in our international business, where endowment products continue to be our strongest selling product.
24090_14_ITEM15_P230_S3	We have seen flat premium levels in our home service segment year over year but our average policy size has increased in 2013 compared to 2012.
24090_14_ITEM15_P231_S0	Riley added, Our invested assets increased by 4.2% to $938 million from $901 million at year-end 2012 due to premium growth and increased yields on investments.
24090_14_ITEM15_P231_S1	We reported investment income growth for the fourth quarter and full year as we obtained higher yields by investing in the municipal and corporate sectors in the current market.
24090_14_ITEM15_P231_S2	Our portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed maturity investment grade bonds currently which are driving our overall yield just over 4.1% compared with 3.8% in 2012 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P232_S0	Further, book value per share of Class A common stock decreased 6% to $4.91 at December 31, 2013 , compared with $5.25 at year-end 2012 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P232_S1	The 2013 decrease was due primarily to fluctuations in the market values of bonds and stocks in our portfolio as interest rates rose thus reducing fair values on lower coupon securities, Riley said.
24090_14_ITEM15_P233_S0	Riley commented, We recognized investment losses of $0.4 million in the quarter ending December 31, 2013 primarily related to sales of two bond mutual fund issues as new circumstances arose in December surrounding tax planning reviews.
24090_14_ITEM15_P233_S1	We reported net realized losses on investments for the full year of 2012 of $0.2 million compared to gains of $0.2 million for the three months and year ended.
24090_14_ITEM15_P233_S2	No warrants were outstanding during 2013 , as they were all exercised or expired during 2012 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P234_S0	Turning to operating income, Riley noted, Income for the year was boosted by improved investment yield as noted previously.
24090_14_ITEM15_P235_S0	Non-GAAP Financial Measures - The table above reconciles Net Income to Operating Income.
24090_14_ITEM15_P235_S1	Operating Income is a "Non-GAAP" financial measure that is widely used in our industry to evaluate the performance of underwriting operations.
24090_14_ITEM15_P235_S2	Operating Income excludes the Fair Value Changes of Warrants and the after-tax net effects of Net Realized Investment Gains and Losses.
24090_14_ITEM15_P235_S3	We believe it presents a useful view of the performance of our insurance operations.
24090_14_ITEM15_P235_S4	While we believe disclosure of certain Non-GAAP information is informative, you should not consider this information without also considering the information we present in accordance with GAAP.
24090_14_ITEM15_P236_S0	t Life Insurance - Our Life Insurance segment primarily issues endowment and ordinary whole life insurance in U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents and domestically across the United States.
24090_14_ITEM15_P237_S0	Premiums Life insurance premium revenues increased for the fourth quarter and full year of 2013 , due to higher international first year and renewal premiums, which have experienced strong persistency as this block of business ages.
24090_14_ITEM15_P237_S1	Improved new business performance in 2013 reflected strong sales from Colombia, Ecuador, Taiwan, and Venezuela.
24090_14_ITEM15_P237_S2	Endowment sales represented $14.3 million or 73.0% of new first year premium as of December 31, 2013 compared to $14.3 million and 76.0% for the year in 2012.
24090_14_ITEM15_P238_S0	In addition, most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision, which allows policyholders to utilize cash value of a policy to pay premiums and keep policies in force.
24090_14_ITEM15_P239_S0	Benefits and expenses Life insurance benefits and expenses increased by 6.3%.
24090_14_ITEM15_P239_S1	Commission expense decreased 3.8% for the quarter but increased 4.6% for the year ended in 2013 due to the mix of renewals and new premium sales compared to the same periods last year.
24090_14_ITEM15_P239_S2	General expenses were down 8.0% for the quarter but rose 3.3% for the year compared to the same periods in 2012.
24090_14_ITEM15_P239_S3	The overall increase was in our self-insurance health plan claims and temporary labor cost increases in some operation areas.
24090_14_ITEM15_P239_S4	We recorded favorable claim experience which decreased 1.4% and was offset by an increase in surrender expenses and other policy benefits for the fourth quarter and full year of 2013.
24090_14_ITEM15_P239_S5	Amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased by 4.1% compared to 2012 as our persistency was lower this year and increased amortization.
24090_14_ITEM15_P240_S0	t Home Service - Our Home Service Insurance segment provides pre-need and final expense ordinary life insurance and annuities to middle and lower income individuals primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_14_ITEM15_P240_S1	Our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through funeral homes and a home service marketing distribution system.
24090_14_ITEM15_P241_S0	Premiums Home service premiums have remained flat in 2013 compared to 2012 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P241_S1	The purchase of MGLIC as noted above is expected to fit well with our overall home service strategy and increase our presence in Mississippi which we believe will benefit overall sales in that state.
24090_14_ITEM15_P242_S0	Benefits and expenses Home service benefits and expenses increased 1.8% as claims were up by 1.9% for the full year in 2013.
24090_14_ITEM15_P242_S1	We experienced favorable claims that were down 7.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2013.
24090_14_ITEM15_P242_S2	Property claims declined 12.9% to $2.0 million in 2013 compared to 2012 due to Hurricane Isaac, which impacted Louisiana policyholders in the later part of 2012.
24090_14_ITEM15_P243_S0	Our home service policyholders have been negatively impacted by the current economic conditions, including continued high levels of unemployment throughout the country.
24090_14_ITEM15_P243_S1	We have noted average policy face amount increased from $6,574 to $6,771 year over year.
24090_14_ITEM15_P244_S0	t Invested assets Total invested assets including cash and cash equivalents grew 3.7% in 2013 , reflecting additional premium income from new and renewal business and increased investment income over the past year.
24090_14_ITEM15_P245_S0	Cash and cash equivalents represented 5.5% of total cash, cash equivalents and short-term invested assets at year-end 2013 , down from 5.9% in 2012 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P245_S1	These balances fluctuate based upon the timing of premium receipts and bond maturities, bond call activity and ultimate investment into fixed maturity investments.
24090_14_ITEM15_P246_S0	t Investment income Net investment income increased 11.2% and 15.3% for the quarter ended and full year of December 31, 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P246_S1	The gains were due to higher average investment balances and yields increasing during the periods.
24090_14_ITEM15_P246_S2	The policy loan asset balance increased by 13.7% in 2013 , resulting in an increase in policy loan income, a component of investment income.
24090_14_ITEM15_P247_S0	Duration - During 2013 , the Company continued significant investments of bonds in state municipals and corporate utility sector issuers with credit ratings ranging from A A to BBB.
24090_14_ITEM15_P247_S1	The Company began increasing investments in investment-grade corporate, municipal bonds and shorter duration bond mutual funds two years ago to obtain higher yields.
24090_14_ITEM15_P247_S2	The average maturity of the fixed income bond portfolio was 12.0 years with an estimated effective maturity of 7.0 years as of December 31, 2013 .
24090_14_ITEM15_P248_S0	t Realized gains We recorded net losses of $ 0.4 million as discussed above relative to 2013.
24090_14_ITEM15_P248_S1	There were no other than temporary impairments during 2013.
24090_14_ITEM15_P248_S2	We reported a gain of $0.2 million in 2012 and we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment for the three months and year ended December 31, 2012 totaling $1.3 million related to one issuer of bonds in the coal producing energy sector.
24090_14_ITEM15_P248_S3	In 2012 , the Company sold equity mutual funds, which were previously impaired, and other securities for realized gains of $0.6 million for tax considerations.
24090_14_ITEM15_P249_S0	On Wednesday, March 12, Citizens will host a conference call to discuss operating results at 10 a.m.
24090_14_ITEM15_P249_S1	The conference call will be hosted by Rick D. Riley, Vice Chairman and President, Kay Osbourn, Chief Financial Officer, and other members of the Company s management team.

24090_14_ITEM15_P250_S1	The Company utilizes a three-pronged strategy for growth based upon worldwide sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated whole life cash value insurance policies, life insurance product sales in the U.S. and the acquisition of other U.S. based life insurance companies.

24090_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	Citizens, Inc. ( Citizens ) is an insurance holding company serving the life insurance needs of individuals in the United States since 1969 and internationally since 1975.
24090_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	Through our insurance subsidiaries, we pursue a strategy of offering traditional insurance products in niche markets where we believe we are able to achieve competitive advantages.
24090_15_ITEM1_P0_S2	We had approximately $1.4 billion of assets at December 31, 2014 and approximately $4.7 billion of insurance in force.
24090_15_ITEM1_P0_S3	Our core insurance operations include issuing and servicing:
24090_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	final expense and limited liability property policies to middle and lower income households in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas through employee and independent agents in our home service distribution channel.
24090_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	We were formed in 1969 by our Chairman, Harold E. Riley.
24090_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	Prior to our formation, Mr. Riley had many years of experience in the international and domestic life insurance business.
24090_15_ITEM1_P2_S2	Our Company has experienced growth through acquisitions in the domestic market and through market expansion in the international market.
24090_15_ITEM1_P2_S3	We seek to capitalize on the experience of our management team in marketing and operations as we strive to generate bottom line return using knowledge of our niche markets and our well-established distribution channels.
24090_15_ITEM1_P2_S4	We believe our underwriting processes, policy terms, pricing practices and proprietary administrative systems enable us to be competitive in our current markets, while protecting our shareholders and serving our policyholders.
24090_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our business has grown, both internationally and domestically, in recent years.
24090_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	Revenues rose from $190.3 million in 2010 to $230.2 million in 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM1_P3_S2	During the five years ended December 31, 2014 , our assets grew from $974.6 million to $1.4 billion .
24090_15_ITEM1_P3_S3	Total stockholders' equity increased from $219.9 million at December 31, 2010 to $258.4 million at December 31, 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	"Selected Financial Data" in this Report.
24090_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	The following pages describe the operations of our three business segments: Life Insurance, Home Service and Other Non-Insurance Enterprises.
24090_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	Revenues derived from any single customer did not exceed 10% of consolidated revenues in any of the last three years.
24090_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our Life Insurance segment issues ordinary whole life insurance domestically and in U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents.
24090_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	These contracts are designed to provide a fixed amount of insurance coverage over the life of the insured.
24090_15_ITEM1_P6_S2	Additionally, endowment contracts are issued by the Company, which are principally accumulation contracts that incorporate an element of life insurance protection.
24090_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	For the majority of our business, we retain only the first $100,000 of risk on any one life, reinsuring the remainder of the risk.
24090_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	We operate this segment through our subsidiaries: CICA Life Insurance Company of America ("CICA") and Citizens National Life Insurance Company ("CNLIC").
24090_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	We focus our sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies to high net worth, high income residents in Latin America and the Pacific Rim.
24090_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	We have successfully participated in the foreign marketplace since 1975, and we continue to seek opportunities for expansion of our foreign operations.
24090_15_ITEM1_P8_S2	We believe positive attributes of our international insurance business include:
24090_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	persistency experience and mortality rates that are comparable to our U.S. policies.
24090_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	We have implemented several policies and procedures to reduce the risks of asset and premium loss relating to our international business.
24090_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	Approvals for policy issuance are made in our Austin, Texas office and policies are issued and delivered to our independent consultants, who deliver the policies to the insureds.
24090_15_ITEM1_P10_S2	We have no offices, employees or assets outside of the United States.
24090_15_ITEM1_P10_S3	Insurance policy applications and premium payments are submitted by the independent consultants or customers to us, and we review the applications in our home offices in Austin, Texas.
24090_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	Premiums are paid in U.S. Dollars through a U.S. financial institution by check, wire or credit card.
24090_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	The policies we issue contain limitations on benefits for certain causes of death, such as homicide and careless driving.
24090_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	We have also developed disciplined underwriting criteria, which include medical reviews of applicants as well as background and reference checks.
24090_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	In addition, we have a claims policy that requires investigation of substantially all death claims.
24090_15_ITEM1_P12_S3	Furthermore, we perform background reviews and reference checks of prospective marketing firms and consultants.
24090_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	Independent marketing firms and consultants specialize in marketing life insurance products and generally have several years of insurance marketing experience.
24090_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	We maintain standard contracts with the independent marketing firms pursuant to which they provide recruitment, training and supervision of their managers and associates in the service and placement of our products; however, all associates of these firms also contract directly with us as independent contractors and receive their compensation directly from us.
24090_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	Accordingly, should an arrangement between any independent marketing firm and us be terminated for any reason, we believe we would continue with the existing marketing arrangements with the associates of these firms without a material loss of sales.
24090_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our standard agreement with independent marketing firms and consultants provides they are independent contractors responsible for their own operation expenses, and that they are the representative of the prospective insured.
24090_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	In addition, the marketing firms guarantee any debts of their associates to us.
24090_15_ITEM1_P14_S2	The marketing firms receive commissions on all new and renewal policies serviced or placed by them or their associates.
24090_15_ITEM1_P14_S3	All of these contracts provide that the independent marketing firms and consultants are aware of and responsible for compliance with local laws.
24090_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	We offer several ordinary whole life insurance and endowment products designed to meet the needs of our non-U.S. policyowners.
24090_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	These policies have been structured to provide:
24090_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	lifetime income guarantees for an insured or for surviving beneficiaries.
24090_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our international products have living benefit features.
24090_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	Every policy contains guaranteed cash values and is participating (i.e., provides for cash dividends as apportioned by the board of directors).
24090_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	Once a policyowner pays the annual premium and the policy is issued, the owner becomes entitled to a cash dividend as well as an annual guaranteed endowment, if elected.
24090_15_ITEM1_P17_S3	The policyowner has several options with regard to the dividend and annual guaranteed endowments, including the right to assign policy values to the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan, registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), and administered in the United States by our unaffiliated transfer agent.
24090_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	The life insurance business is highly competitive.
24090_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	We compete with a large number of stock and mutual life companies internationally and domestically, as well as with financial institutions that offer insurance products.
24090_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	There are more than 1,000 life insurance companies in the United States, some of which also provide insurance to foreign residents.
24090_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	We face competition primarily from companies formed and operated in the country in which the insureds reside, from companies that operate in the same manner as we do and from companies that are foreign to the countries in which policies are sold, but issue insurance policies denominated in the local currency of those countries.
24090_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	A substantial number of companies may be deemed to have a competitive advantage over us due to their significantly greater financial resources, histories of successful operations and larger marketing forces.
24090_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	However, we believe that our experience, combined with our product portfolio features, allows us to compete effectively in pursuing new business.
24090_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	Because premiums on our international policies are paid in U.S. Dollars drawn on U.S. financial institutions, and we pay claims and benefits in U.S. Dollars, we provide a product that is different from the products offered by foreign-domiciled companies.
24090_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	Our international policies are usually acquired by individuals with significant net worth and earnings that place them in the upper income brackets of their respective countries.
24090_15_ITEM1_P22_S2	The policies sold by our foreign competitors are generally offered broadly and are priced using the mortality of the entire population of the geographic region.
24090_15_ITEM1_P22_S3	Our mortality charges are therefore typically lower, which provides a competitive advantage.
24090_15_ITEM1_P22_S4	Additionally, the assets backing the reserves for our foreign competitors' policies must be substantially invested in their respective countries and, therefore, are exposed to the inflationary risks and social or economic crises that have been more common in these foreign countries.
24090_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	The majority of our domestic inforce business results from blocks of business of insurance companies we have acquired over the past 15 years.
24090_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our acquisition transition strategy focuses on the introduction of our cash accumulation ordinary whole life products to independent marketing consultants associated with companies we have acquired, while continuing to service the needs of acquired policyholders.
24090_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	In the Mountain West, Midwest and the southern United States, we seek to serve middle income households through the sale of cash accumulation ordinary whole life insurance products.
24090_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	Our distribution strategy is through marketing consultants, comprised primarily of part-time, second-career sales associates (such as teachers, coaches, community leaders and others) in rural and urban areas.
24090_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	Over the past few years, new product sales have been modest while existing policies have been running off at a greater pace compressing the block of insurance in force.
24090_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our domestic life insurance products focus primarily on living needs and provide benefits focused toward accumulating money for the policyowner.
24090_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	The features of our domestic life insurance products include:
24090_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	an option to waive premium payments in the event of disability.
24090_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our life insurance products are principally designed to address the insured's concern about outliving his or her monthly income, while at the same time providing death benefits.
24090_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	The primary purpose of our product portfolio is to help the insured create capital for needs such as retirement income, children's higher education funds, business opportunities, emergencies and health care needs.
24090_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	The U.S. life insurance industry is a mature industry that, in recent years, has experienced little to no growth.
24090_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	Competition is intense because the life insurance industry is consolidating, with larger, more efficient and more effective organizations emerging from consolidation.
24090_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	Many domestic life insurance companies have significantly greater financial, marketing forces and other resources, longer business histories and more diversified lines of insurance products than we do.
24090_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	We also face competition from companies marketing in person as well as with direct mail and Internet sales campaigns.
24090_15_ITEM1_P30_S2	Although we may be at a competitive disadvantage to these entities, we believe our premium rates and policy features are generally competitive with those of other life insurance companies selling similar types of ordinary whole life insurance.
24090_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our Home Service segment operates in this market through our subsidiaries Security Plan Life Insurance Company ("SPLIC"), Magnolia Guaranty Life Insurance Company ("MGLIC") and Security Plan Fire Insurance Company ("SPFIC"), and focuses on the life insurance needs of the middle and lower income markets, primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	To a lesser extent, our Home Service segment sells limited-liability, named peril property policies covering dwelling and contents.
24090_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our home service insurance products consist primarily of small face amount ordinary whole life and pre-need policies, which are designed to fund final expenses for the insured, primarily consisting of funeral and burial costs.
24090_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	The average life insurance policy face amount issued was approximately $6,700 in 2014 ; therefore, the underwriting performed on these applications is limited.
24090_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	Our property coverages are limited to $30,000 maximum coverage on any one dwelling and contents, while content-only coverage and dwelling-only coverage is limited to $20,000 .
24090_15_ITEM1_P33_S3	We face competition in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas from other companies specializing in home service distribution of insurance.
24090_15_ITEM1_P33_S4	We seek to compete based upon our emphasis on personal service to our customers.
24090_15_ITEM1_P33_S5	We intend to continue premium growth within this segment via direct sales and acquisitions.
24090_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	Other Non-insurance Enterprises includes Computing Technology, Inc., which provides data processing services to the Company, and Insurance Investors, Inc., which provides aviation transportation to the Company.
24090_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	This segment also includes the results of Citizens, Inc., the parent Company.
24090_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our administrative operations principally serve our life insurance segment and are conducted primarily at our executive offices in Austin, Texas through approximately 120 administrative, operating and underwriting personnel.
24090_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	Our Home Service operations are conducted to a large degree from our district offices in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, as well as our support center in Donaldsonville, Louisiana through approximately 70 operations personnel.
24090_15_ITEM1_P36_S2	At our executive offices, we also perform policy design, marketing oversight, underwriting, accounting and reporting, customer service, administration and investing activities.
24090_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our senior management has significant experience in insurance company application system design and implementation.
24090_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	Since the mid-1960's, our senior management has been leading development of evolving insurance applications.
24090_15_ITEM1_P37_S2	We have a single integrated system for our entire Company, which is a centrally-controlled, mainframe-based administrative system.
24090_15_ITEM1_P37_S3	Functions of our policy administrative system include policy set up, administration, billing and collections, commission calculation, valuation, automated internal audit functions, storage backup, image management and other related functions.
24090_15_ITEM1_P37_S4	Each company we acquire is ultimately converted onto our administrative system.
24090_15_ITEM1_P37_S5	This system has been in place for many years, and we believe it is a significant asset to us.
24090_15_ITEM1_P37_S6	We update our administrative system on an ongoing basis but it does require programmers experienced in our IT environment.
24090_15_ITEM1_P37_S7	This system is also capable of significant expansion of volume without substantial capital outlay or increase in staff.
24090_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	We do not believe issuance of insurance policies to residents of foreign countries subjects us to the jurisdiction of those countries.
24090_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	We have never qualified to do business in any foreign country and have never submitted our insurance policies issued to residents of foreign countries for approval by any foreign or domestic insurance regulatory agency.
24090_15_ITEM1_P38_S2	We sell our policies to residents of foreign countries using foreign independent marketing firms and independent consultants, and we rely on those persons to comply with laws applicable to them in marketing our insurance products in their respective countries.
24090_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our U.S. insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations.
24090_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	State insurance laws establish supervisory agencies with broad regulatory authority to regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of each state in which they are licensed.
24090_15_ITEM1_P39_S2	In addition, U.S. laws, such as the USA Patriot Act of 2001, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("the Dodd-Frank Act"), are examples of U.S. regulations that affect our business.
24090_15_ITEM1_P39_S3	We are subject to comprehensive regulations under the USA Patriot Act with respect to money laundering, as well as federal regulations regarding privacy and confidentiality.
24090_15_ITEM1_P39_S4	Our insurance products and thus our businesses also are affected by U.S. federal, state and local tax laws.
24090_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act focuses on financial reform and may result in significant changes to the regulation of institutions operating in the financial services industry, including the Company.
24090_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	Legislative or regulatory requirements imposed by or promulgated in connection with this Act may make it more expensive for the Company to conduct its business, may have a material adverse effect on the overall business climate and could materially affect the profitability of the results of operations and financial condition of financial institutions.
24090_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	assurance it will not adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	In general, government regulation at the federal level may increase and may result in unpredictable consequences for the Company.
24090_15_ITEM1_P41_S2	In addition, other federal laws and regulations apply to us in areas such as pension regulations, privacy, tort reform and taxation.
24090_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	The purpose of the laws and regulations that affect our insurance business is primarily to protect our insureds and not our stockholders.
24090_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations.
24090_15_ITEM1_P42_S2	In addition, insurance regulatory authorities (including state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general) periodically make inquiries and regularly conduct examinations regarding compliance by us and our subsidiaries with insurance, and other laws and regulations regarding the conduct of our insurance businesses.
24090_15_ITEM1_P42_S3	We cooperate with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action when warranted.
24090_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are collectively licensed to transact business in 32 states.
24090_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	We have insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the states of Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.
24090_15_ITEM1_P43_S2	Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are licensed and regulated in all U.S. jurisdictions in which they conduct insurance business.
24090_15_ITEM1_P43_S3	The extent of this regulation varies, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations based upon the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) model rules governing the financial condition of insurers, including standards of solvency, types and concentration of investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, credit for reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy, and the business conduct of insurers, including marketing and sales practices and claims handling.
24090_15_ITEM1_P43_S4	In addition, statutes and regulations usually require the licensing of insurers and their agents, the approval of policy forms and related materials and the approval of rates for certain types of insurance products.
24090_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	All U.S. jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries conduct insurance business have enacted legislation that requires each U.S. insurance company in a holding company system, except captive insurance companies, to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its jurisdiction of domicile and to furnish that regulatory authority financial and other information concerning the operations of, and the interrelationships and transactions among, companies within its holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system.
24090_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	These laws and regulations also regulate transactions between insurance companies and their parents and affiliates.
24090_15_ITEM1_P44_S2	Generally, these laws and regulations require that all transactions within a holding company system between an insurer and its affiliates be fair and reasonable and that the insurer's statutory capital and surplus following any transaction with an affiliate be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.
24090_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	Statutory surplus is the excess of admitted assets over the sum of statutory liabilities and capital.
24090_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	For certain types of agreements and transactions between an insurer and its affiliates, these laws and regulations require prior notification to, and non-disapproval or approval by, the insurance regulatory authority of the insurer's jurisdiction of domicile.
24090_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	The payment of dividends or other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by the insurance laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile.
24090_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	The laws and regulations of some of these jurisdictions also prohibit an insurer from declaring or paying a dividend except out of its earned surplus or require the insurer to obtain regulatory approval before it may do so.
24090_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	In addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employee or other services) if they determine such payment could be adverse to policyholders or insurance contract holders of the subsidiary.
24090_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled require that a controlling party obtain the approval of the insurance commissioner of the insurance company's jurisdiction of domicile prior to acquiring control of the insurer and may delay, deter or prevent a transaction our shareholders might consider desirable.
24090_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements are imposed on life and property and casualty insurance companies.
24090_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	The NAIC has established minimum capital requirements in the form of RBC.
24090_15_ITEM1_P48_S2	RBC factors the type of business written by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company's business to develop a minimum level of capital called "authorized control level risk-based capital" and compares this level to adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves.
24090_15_ITEM1_P48_S3	Should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk-based capital fall below 200%, a series of actions by the affected company would begin.
24090_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	Government actions in response to the recent financial crisis and market volatility could significantly impact our current regulations.
24090_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	As part of a comprehensive reform of financial services regulation known as the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress established an office within the federal government to collect information about the insurance industry, recommend standards, and represent the United States in dealing with foreign insurance regulators.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investing in our Company involves certain risks.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Set forth below are certain risks with respect to our Company.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Readers should carefully review these risks, together with the other information contained in this report.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties we have described in this report are not the only ones we face.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem not material, may also adversely affect our business.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Any of the risks discussed in this report or that are presently unknown or not material, if they were to actually occur, could result in a significant adverse impact on our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	References in the risk factors below to "we," "us," "our," "Citizens" and like terms relate to Citizens, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statement basis, unless specifically identified otherwise.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We operate our subsidiaries as separate and distinct entities with respect to corporate formalities.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	A substantial amount of our revenue comes from residents of foreign countries and is subject to risks associated with widespread political instability, foreign insurance laws and asset transfer restrictions.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	A substantial part of our insurance policy sales are from foreign countries, primarily those in Latin America and the Pacific Rim.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	There is a risk that we may lose a significant portion of these sales should widespread political instability occur in these countries.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We cannot confidently predict what impact we might see relative to widespread political instability in the foreign countries we operate, but it could significantly impact our business.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Traditionally, we have sought to address risks associated with foreign countries by, among other things, not accepting insurance applications outside of the U.S., maintaining all of our assets in the U.S. and requiring policy premiums be paid to us in U.S. Dollars.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Accordingly, we have never qualified to do business in any foreign country and have never submitted our insurance policies issued to residents of foreign countries for approval by any foreign or domestic insurance regulatory agency.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We sell our policies to residents of foreign countries using foreign independent marketing firms and independent consultants, and we rely on those persons to comply with applicable laws in marketing our insurance products.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Company s future sales and financial results are dependent upon avoiding significant regulatory interruptions in receiving insurance policy applications for residents outside of the United States.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Currency control laws in foreign countries, if implemented, could materially adversely affect our revenues by imposing restrictions on asset transfers outside of a country where our insureds reside.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	There can be no assurance that such situations will not occur and that our revenues, results of operations and financial condition will not be materially, adversely affected if they do occur.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The government of a foreign country could also determine its residents may not buy life insurance from us unless we became qualified to do business in that country or unless our policies purchased by its residents receive prior approval from its insurance regulators.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Also, new laws or regulations could be implemented or new applications of existing laws or regulations could occur, which could result in the cessation of marketing activities by our independent marketing firms and consultants.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	From time to time we have become aware of new foreign laws, regulations or new interpretations of foreign laws or regulations that may have an adverse effect on the marketing efforts of our foreign independent marketing firms and consultants.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Although we believe foreign regulatory authorities have no jurisdiction over us and any actions, including fines, would be unenforceable against us, we cannot assure you any of these laws, regulations, or application of them by foreign regulatory authorities will not have an adverse effect on the marketing efforts of our independent marketing consultants and, in turn, on our revenues.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Further, there is no assurance we would be able to qualify to do business in any foreign country or that its insurance regulatory authorities would approve our policies if we decided to submit our insurance policies for approval.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Any of the foregoing could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Also, we do not determine whether our independent consultants are required to be licensed to sell insurance in the countries in which they market our policies.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	If our independent consultants were not in compliance with applicable laws, including licensing laws, they could be required to cease operations, which would reduce our revenues.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	business if regulation were to be imposed on us due to the lack of uniformity of regulation in our foreign markets, but we believe we could expend time and incur expense in assessing and complying with foreign regulation which we deem may impact our business in a particular country.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Consequently, we may decide to remove ourselves from or avoid a market if foreign regulation were deemed untenable.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our operating results and financial condition may be affected if the liabilities actually incurred differ, or if our estimates of those liabilities change, from the amounts we have reserved for in connection with the noncompliance of a substantial portion of our insurance policies with Sections 7702 and 7702A under the Internal Revenue Code.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In the first quarter of 2015, we announced that we identified that a substantial portion of the life insurance policies issued by our subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702 and 7702A of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") of 1986.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	As a result, we have established a reserve of $11.4 million for probable expenses and liabilities associated with this tax compliance matter, which amount represents the low end of management s estimated range of those probable expenses and liabilities of $11.4 million to $40.0 million net of tax.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	This estimated range includes projected toll charges and fees as well as increased claims liability for past claims, reserves increases to bring policies into compliance and other probable liabilities resulting from this tax compliance matter.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Our estimated range reflects the uncertainties with respect to the required course of action and other matters unknown at this time.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Currently, management believes there is not a specific estimable amount for these probable liabilities and expenses which is more likely than other specific amounts within our estimated range.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The process of determining our estimated range was a complex undertaking and involved management s judgment based upon a variety of factors known at the time.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Given the number of factors considered and the significant variables assumed in establishing our estimated range, actual amounts incurred may exceed our reserve and the high end of our estimated range of expenses and liabilities.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	To the extent the amount reserved by the Company is insufficient to meet the actual amount of our liability, or if our estimates of those liabilities change in the future, our financial condition and results of operation may be materially adversely affected.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The majority of our foreign policyholders elect to invest their policies annually payable cash benefits in our Class A common stock through the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan (the Plan ), a stock investment plan registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
24090_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If a securities regulatory authority were to deem the Plan's operation contrary to securities laws, a reduction in the amount of Class A common stock purchased on the open market through the Plan could occur.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	On or about April 2001, the Company adopted the Plan, as amended and restated from time to time.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The Plan is registered with the SEC pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	For further information on the filing history of the Plan s Registration Statement, please see the risk factor directly below titled The previous Registration Statement covering the Plan was not declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The general purpose of the Plan is to provide a convenient and economical means for new investors to make an initial investment in our Class A common stock and for existing investors to purchase additional shares of our Class A common stock.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Specifically, the Plan offers employees, agents, policyholders, independent consultants and potential investors stock purchase opportunities of the Company s Class A common stock, no par value per share ( Common Stock ).
24090_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	It also offers security holders the ability to maintain registered ownership of their securities in a manner which facilitates efficient purchases and sales of Citizens Class A common stock in the open market.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Plan is administered by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., located in Canton Massachusetts, ( Computershare ), a company which operates in 20 countries around the globe and also serves as our transfer agent.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Computershare is deemed an independent agent of the Company.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Computershare satisfies applicable U.S. legal requirements (including, without limitation, the requirements of Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), and facilitates open market purchases and sales of Citizens Class A common stock under the Plan through registered brokers and dealers.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Additional disclosures concerning the Plan s impact on our Capital Stock can be found in our Item 1A. Risk Factors under the heading, Risks Relating to Our Capital Stock.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Any electing person who has met the requirements to participate in the Plan and has not revoked such election to participate in the Plan is considered a Plan Participant.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	More than 89% percent of the shares of Class A common stock that have been purchased under the Plan have been purchased by foreign holders of life insurance policies (or related brokers); the remaining shares of Class A common stock that have been purchased under the Plan have been purchased by approximately 1,400 participants resident in the United States.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	International holders of life insurance policies underwritten by the Company may assign annually payable cash benefits from their insurance policies to the Plan and employees participating in the Plan may allocate a portion of their compensation to the Plan and the Company remits these amounts to Computershare.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Class A common stock in the open market from time to time through independent broker dealers selected by the Computershare.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	None of the shares of Class A common stock purchased by the Plan Participants is issued by the Company, and the Company does not receive any proceeds from these purchases.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	An international policyholder must first consent in writing to be contacted by Citizens regarding the Plan before they are given the option to assign annually payable cash benefits from their insurance policies to the Plan.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	At the point of introduction to the Plan, international policyholders receive a copy of the Plan prospectus explaining the risks associated with purchasing Citizens Class A common stock through the Plan.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Since the distribution of our Class A common stock is registered and publicly traded in the U.S. and because we believe that foreign regulatory authorities have no jurisdiction over us, the offer and sale of our Class A common stock through the Plan is not registered under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If a foreign securities regulatory authority were to determine the offer and sale of our Class A common stock under the Plan were contrary to applicable laws and regulations of its jurisdiction, such authority may issue or assert a fine, penalty or cease and desist order against us.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	While we would vigorously dispute the ability of such authority to assert jurisdiction over us, such a dispute may distract from our business and may have a material adverse impact on our financial position.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Additionally, in such a situation participation in the Plan by our international policyholders in that foreign jurisdiction could decrease.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	This also could materially reduce the amount of our Class A common stock purchased and sold in the open market under the Plan, as historically a significant volume of shares have been purchased under the Plan by policyholders through annually payable cash benefits assigned to the Plan.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We face financial and capital market risks in our operations.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	As an insurance holding company with significant investment exposure, we face material financial and capital markets risk in our operations.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Due to the low interest rate environment over the past three years, we experienced significant call activity on our fixed income portfolio that decreased our investment yields compared to prior years.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Economic uncertainty has recently been exacerbated by the increased potential for default by one or more European sovereign debt issuers, the potential partial or complete dissolution of the Eurozone and its common currency and the negative impact of such events on global financial institutions and capital markets generally.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Actions or inactions of European governments may impact these actual or perceived risks.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In the recent past, one rating agency downgraded the U.S.'s long-term debt credit rating from AAA.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Future actions or inactions of the United States government, including a shutdown of the federal government, could increase the actual or perceived risk that the U.S. may not ultimately pay its obligations when due and may disrupt financial markets.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Changes in market interest rates may significantly affect our profitability.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Some of our products, principally traditional whole life insurance with annuity riders, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our "spread," or the difference between the amounts we are required to pay under our contracts to policyholders and the rate of return we are able to earn on our investments intended to support obligations under the contracts.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our spread is an integral component of our net income.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured, prepaid, been sold, or called at lower yields, reducing our investment margin.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our fixed income bond portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk as a significant portion of the portfolio is callable.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Lowering interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in investment margins on some of our products.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	However, our ability to lower these rates could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates, and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our investment portfolio is subject to various risks that may result in realized investment losses.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	In particular, decreases in the fair value of fixed maturities may significantly reduce the value of our investments, and as a result, our financial condition may suffer.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations under these securities could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in the recognition of investment losses.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P31_S2	The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the bonds included in our portfolio and by other factors that may result in the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In particular, at December 31, 2014 , fixed maturities represented $932.2 million or 87.5% of our total investments of $1,065.0 million .
24090_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The fair value of fixed maturities and the related investment income fluctuates depending on general economic and market conditions.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The fair value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us will generally increase or decrease in line with changes in market interest rates.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	An investment has prepayment risk when there is a risk that the timing of cash flows resulting from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The impact of value fluctuations affects our consolidated financial statements, as a large portion of our fixed maturities are classified as available-for- sale, with changes in fair value reflected in our stockholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss).
24090_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	No similar adjustment is made for liabilities to reflect a change in interest rates.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Therefore, interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect our stockholders' equity, total comprehensive income and/or cash flows.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	For mortgage-backed securities, credit risk exists if mortgagees default on the underlying mortgages.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Although at December 31, 2014 , approximately 96.6% of our fixed maturities were investment grade with 81.4% rated A or above, all of our fixed maturities are subject to credit risk.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	If any of the issuers of our fixed maturities suffer financial setbacks, the ratings on the fixed maturities could fall (with a concurrent fall in fair value) and, in a worst case scenario, the issuer could default on its financial obligations.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P36_S3	If the issuer defaults, we could have realized losses associated with the impairment of the securities.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities may be realized or result in future impairments, resulting in a reduction in our net income.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and are, therefore, excluded from our net income.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Our total gross unrealized losses on our available-for-sale securities portfolio at December 31, 2014 were $3.4 million .
24090_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	The accumulated change in estimated fair value of these securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is realized upon sale of the security or in the event that the decline in estimated fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary and an impairment charge to earnings is taken.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Realized losses or impairments may have a material adverse effect on our net income in a particular quarterly or annual period.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims and we may be required to establish additional reserves, which in turn may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We maintain reserves to cover our estimated exposure for claims relating to our issued insurance policies.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Reserves, whether calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or statutory accounting practices prescribed by various state insurance regulators, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections, of what we expect claims will be based on mortality assumptions that are determined by various regulatory authorities.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Many reserve assumptions are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P40_S3	In addition, when we acquire other domestic life insurance companies, our assessment of the adequacy of acquired policy liabilities is subject to our estimates and assumptions.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops, and adjustments to reserves are reflected in our statements of operations for the period in which such estimates are updated.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, future developments may require us to increase claims reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the periods in which such increases occur.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the costs of customer relationships acquired, which would increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	At December 31, 2014 , we had $157.5 million of deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	DAC represents costs that vary with and are primarily related to the successful sale and issuance of our insurance policies and are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	These costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions, solicitation and printing costs, sales material costs and some support costs, such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Under U.S. GAAP, DAC is amortized to income over the lives of the underlying policies, in relation to the profit stream.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	In addition, when we acquire a block of insurance policies, we assign a portion of the purchase price to the right to receive future net cash flows from existing insurance and investment contracts and policies.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	This intangible asset, called the cost of customer relationships acquired, or CCRA, represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	At December 31, 2014 , we had $23.5 million of CCRA.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P44_S3	We amortize the value of this intangible asset in a manner similar to the amortization of DAC.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our amortization of DAC and CCRA generally depends upon anticipated profits from investments, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, persistency and maintenance expense margins.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	For example, if our insurance policy lapse and surrender rates were to exceed the assumptions upon which we priced our insurance policies, or if actual persistency proves to be less than our persistency assumptions, especially in the early years of a policy, we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We regularly review the quality of our DAC and CCRA to determine if they are recoverable from future income.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	If these costs are not recoverable, they are charged to expenses in the financial period in which we make this determination.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses, investment returns, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, lapses or persistency may cause us to increase the amortization of DAC or CCRA, or both, or to record a current period expense to increase benefit reserves, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We may be required to recognize an impairment on the value of our goodwill, which would increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the amount paid by us to acquire various life insurance companies over the fair value of their net assets at the date of the acquisition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Under U.S. GAAP, we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the "reporting unit" level, which is either an operating segment or a business that is one level below the operating segment.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Goodwill is impaired if its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P50_S2	This may occur for various reasons, including changes in actual or expected earnings or cash flows of a reporting unit, generation of earnings by a reporting unit at a lower rate than similar businesses or declines in market prices for publicly traded businesses similar to our reporting units.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P50_S3	If any portion of our goodwill becomes impaired, we would be required to recognize the amount of the impairment as a current-period expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Goodwill in our consolidated financial statements was $17.3 million as of December 31, 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We are a defendant in lawsuits, which may adversely affect our financial condition and detract from the time our management is able to devote to our business, and we are subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory matters.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We may from time to time be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our business operations, including, but not limited to:
24090_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	disputes over insurance coverage or claims adjudication; regulatory compliance with state laws; regulatory compliance with insurance and securities laws; disputes with our marketing firms, consultants and employee-agents over compensation, termination of contracts and related claims; disputes regarding our tax liabilities; disputes relating to reinsurance and coinsurance agreements; and disputes relating to businesses acquired and operated by us.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	In the absence of countervailing considerations, we would expect to defend any such claims vigorously.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	However, in doing so, we could incur significant defense costs, including attorneys' fees, other direct litigation costs and the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Further, if we suffer an adverse judgment as a result of any claim, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	A number of U.S. jurisdictions have been investigating life insurer practices for compliance with unclaimed property laws.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	In highly publicized incidents, the practice by certain companies of using data available on the U.S. Social Security Administration's Death Master File or a similar data base in order to avoid paying periodic benefits under annuity contracts but not using the same data base to determine when death benefits were owed was disclosed.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P55_S2	This asymmetric conduct by certain insurers has led a number of jurisdictions to require life insurers to use this same data to identify instances where amounts under life insurance policies and annuity contracts are payable and to locate and pay beneficiaries under such contracts.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The National Conference of Insurance Legislators ("NCOIL") has adopted the Model Unclaimed Life Insurance Benefits Act ("Model Act") and several states have adopted legislation that is substantially similar to the Model Act adopted by NCOIL.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	beneficiaries or, if no beneficiary can be located, escheat the policy benefit to the respective state government as unclaimed property.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P57_S1	The Model Act could result in additional payments to beneficiaries, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws, and/or administrative penalties.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P57_S2	It is also possible that life insurers may be subject to claims regarding their business practices as a result given the legal uncertainty in this area.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P57_S3	However, recent court decisions in West Virginia and Florida have upheld the well established insurance law principal that life insurance policies are not due and payable until the insurance company receives due proof of death, and have further held an insurance company has no duty to search the Death Master File or other databases to determine whether deaths have occurred that have not been reported to the company.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Despite the fact we have no history of the asymmetric conduct in question, we have received notices from Louisiana Department of Treasury, Arkansas Auditor of State and the Texas State Comptroller, indicating they intend to audit Citizens, Inc. and certain of its affiliates for compliance with unclaimed property laws.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P58_S1	The audits may result in additional payments to beneficiaries, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws, administrative penalties, interest, and changes to the Company's procedures for the identification and escheatment of abandoned property.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P58_S2	The Company believes additional escheatment of funds in Arkansas or Texas will not be material to our financial condition or results.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P58_S3	However, additional escheatment of funds in Louisiana, which may subsequently be deemed abandoned under the Louisiana Department of Treasury s audit, could be substantial for SPLIC.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P58_S4	At this time, the Company is not able to estimate any of these possible amounts.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Reinsurers with which we do business could increase their premium rates and may not honor their obligations, leaving us liable for the reinsured coverage.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We reinsure certain risks underwritten by our various insurance subsidiaries.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P60_S2	The high cost of reinsurance or lack of affordable coverage could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P61_S1	We may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities and, even if highly desirable or necessary, we may not be able to obtain replacement reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts or at rates economic to us.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P61_S2	If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling or unable to bear an increase in net exposures, we may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P61_S3	In addition, our reinsurance facilities may be canceled, pursuant to their terms, upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including a change of control of our Company (generally defined as the acquisition of 10% or more of our voting equity securities) or the failure of our insurance company subsidiaries to maintain the minimum required levels of statutory surplus.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P61_S4	Any of these potential developments could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	In 2014 , we reinsured $516.6 million of face amount of our life insurance policies.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Amounts reinsured in 2014 represented 10.5% of the face amount of direct life insurance in force in that year.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Although the cost of reinsurance is, in some cases, reflected in premium rates, under certain reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer may increase the rate it charges us for reinsurance.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P63_S1	If our cost of reinsurance were to increase, we might not be able to recover these increased costs, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P63_S2	See Note 5 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We may not be able to continue our past strategy of acquiring other U.S. life insurance companies, and we may not realize improvements to our financial results as a result of our past or any future acquisitions.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We have acquired 17 U.S. life insurance companies since 1987.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Our objective in this strategy has been to increase our assets, revenues and capital, improve our competitive position and increase our earnings, in part by realizing certain operating efficiencies associated with economies of scale.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We evaluate possible acquisitions of other insurance companies on an ongoing basis.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P66_S1	While our business model is not dependent primarily upon acquisitions, the time frame for achieving or further improving our market positions can be shortened through acquisitions.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P66_S2	There can be no assurance that suitable acquisitions presenting opportunities for continued growth and operating efficiencies will be available to us, or that we will realize the anticipated financial results from completed acquisitions.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P66_S3	In addition, we face intense competition in seeking to make acquisitions, much of which is from companies with greater financial and operational resources than we have.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Even if we identify and complete insurance company acquisitions, we may be unable to integrate them on an economically favorable basis.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities and the failure to achieve anticipated operating efficiencies, revenues, earnings or cash flow.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P68_S1	The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Our international and domestic operations face significant competition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Our international marketing plan focuses on making available U.S. Dollar-denominated life insurance products to high net worth, high income individuals residing in more than 30 countries.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P70_S1	New competition could increase the supply of available insurance, which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive profitable rates to us, thereby adversely affecting our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Existing barriers to entry in the foreign markets we serve may not be sufficient to impede potential competitors from entering such markets.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P70_S3	In connection with our business with foreign nationals, we experience competition primarily from the following sources, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have:
24090_15_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Foreign operated companies with U.S. Dollar policies.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We face direct competition from companies that operate in the same manner as we operate in our international markets.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Companies foreign to the countries in which their policies are sold but that issue local currency policies.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Another group of our competitors in the international marketplace consists of companies that are foreign to the countries in which their policies are sold but issue life insurance policies denominated in the local currencies of those countries.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Local currency policies provide the benefit of assets located in the country of foreign residents, but entail risks of uncertainty due to local currency fluctuations, as well as the perceived instability and weakness of local currencies.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Locally operated companies with local currency policies.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P75_S1	We compete with companies formed and operated in the country in which our foreign insureds reside.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Generally, these companies are subject to risks of currency fluctuations, and they primarily use mortality tables based on experience of the local population as a whole.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P75_S3	These mortality tables are typically based on significantly shorter life spans than those we use.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P75_S4	As a result, the cost of insurance from these companies tends to be higher than ours.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P75_S5	Although these companies typically market their policies to a broader section of the population than do our independent marketing firms and independent consultants, there can be no assurance that these companies will not endeavor to place a greater emphasis on our target market and compete more directly with us.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P76_S0	In the United States, we compete with more than 1,000 other life insurance companies of various sizes.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P77_S0	The life insurance business in the United States is highly competitive, in part because it is a mature industry that, in recent years, has experienced little to no growth in life insurance sales.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Many domestic life insurance companies have substantially greater financial resources, longer business histories and more diversified lines of insurance coverage than we do.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P77_S2	These companies also have larger sales forces than we have.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Competition in the United States has also increased recently because the life insurance industry is consolidating, with larger, more efficient organizations emerging from the consolidation.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P78_S0	In addition, from time to time, companies enter and exit the markets in which we operate, thereby increasing competition at times when there are new entrants.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P78_S1	We may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices, or for other reasons.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P79_S0	There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in any of our markets.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P79_S1	If we do not, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Sales of our products may be reduced if we are unable to (i) establish and maintain commercial relationships with independent marketing firms and independent consultants (ii) attract and retain employee agents or (iii) develop and maintain our distribution sources.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We distribute our insurance products through several distribution channels, including independent marketing firms and independent consultants and our employee agents.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P81_S1	These relationships are significant for both our revenues and our profits.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P81_S2	In our life insurance segment, we depend almost exclusively on the services of independent marketing firms and independent consultants.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P81_S3	In our home service insurance segment, we depend on employee agents whose role in our distribution process is integral to developing and maintaining relationships with policyholders.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Significant competition exists among insurers in attracting and maintaining marketers of demonstrated ability.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Some of our competitors may offer better compensation packages for marketing firms, independent consultants and agents and broader arrays of products and have a greater diversity of distribution resources, better brand recognition, more competitive pricing, lower cost structures and greater financial strength or claims paying ratings than we do.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Any reduction in our ability to attract and retain effective sales representatives could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Loss of the services of our senior management team would likely hinder development of our operating and marketing programs and our strategy for expanding our business.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We rely on the participation of our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Harold E. Riley (age 86 ), and our Vice Chairman of the Board and President, Rick D. Riley (age 61 ), in connection with the development and execution of our operating and marketing plans and strategy for expanding our business.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P85_S1	We anticipate that their expertise will continue to be of substantial value in connection with our operations.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P85_S2	The loss of the services of either of these individuals could have a significant adverse effect on our business and prospects.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P85_S3	We do not have an employment agreement with either of these persons nor do we carry a key-man insurance policy on either of their lives.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the United States, which increases our costs of doing business and could restrict the conduct of our business.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in U.S. jurisdictions wherein we do business, as well as anti-money laundering regulations adopted under the USA Patriot Act.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Insurance company regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, with substantially lesser protections to shareholders of the regulated insurance companies.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P88_S1	To that end, all the states in which we do business have insurance regulatory agencies with broad powers under law with respect to such things as: licensing companies to transact business; mandating capital and surplus requirements; regulating trade and claims practices; approving policy forms; and restricting companies' ability to enter and exit markets.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P89_S0	The capacity for an insurance company's growth in premiums is partially a function of its required statutory surplus.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus, as measured by statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by a company's state of domicile, is considered important by all state insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P89_S2	Failure to maintain required levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action by regulatory authorities.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Most insurance regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant, renew, suspend and revoke licenses and approvals, and could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities, including acquisitions of other insurance companies, require us to add capital to our insurance company subsidiaries, or fine us.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P90_S1	If we are unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, or if our insurance business is determined not to comply fully with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations and their interpretations, including the USA Patriot Act, our revenues, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Although the U.S. federal government has not historically regulated the insurance business, the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, expands the federal presence in insurance oversight.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P91_S1	The Act's requirements include streamlining the state-based regulation of reinsurance and non-admitted insurance (also known as surplus lines insurance, which is property or casualty insurance written by a company that is not licensed to sell policies of insurance in a given state).
24090_15_ITEM1A_P91_S2	This legislation also establishes a new Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury with powers over all lines of insurance except health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P91_S3	The Federal Insurance Office is authorized to, among other things, gather data and information to monitor aspects of the insurance industry, identify issues in the regulation of insurers about insurance matters and preempt state insurance measures under certain circumstances.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P91_S4	As this Act calls for numerous studies and contemplates further regulation, the future impact of the Act on our results of operations or our financial condition cannot be determined at this time, but could have an adverse impact on profitable operations.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Changes in U.S. regulation may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and limit our prospective growth.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Currently, the U.S. Federal Government does not directly regulate the insurance business, although initiatives for Federal regulation of insurance are proposed by members of the U.S. Congress from time to time.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P93_S1	However, Federal legislation, regulations and administrative policies in several other areas can materially and adversely affect insurance companies, including our business.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P93_S2	These areas include U.S. anti-money laundering laws and related regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations (collectively, the BSA ), other financial services regulations, securities regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P93_S3	In addition, various forms of direct federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our failure to maintain effective information systems could adversely affect our business.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P95_S0	We must maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop new information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P95_S1	If we do not maintain adequate systems, we could experience adverse consequences, including products acquired through acquisition, inadequate information on which to base pricing, underwriting and reserve decisions, regulatory problems, failure to meet prompt payment obligations, increases in administrative expenses and loss of customers.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Some of our information technology systems and software are mainframe-based, legacy-type systems that require an ongoing commitment of resources to maintain current standards.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P96_S1	Our systems utilize proprietary code requiring highly skilled personnel.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P96_S2	Due to the unique nature of our proprietary operating environment, we could have difficulty finding personnel with the skills required to provide ongoing system maintenance and development as we seek to keep pace with changes in our products and business models, information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and policyholder needs.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P96_S3	Our success is dependent upon, among other things, maintaining and enhancing the effectiveness of existing systems, as well as continuing to integrate, develop and enhance our information systems to support business processes in a cost-effective manner.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Our failure to protect confidential information and privacy could result in the loss of customers, subject us to fines and penalties and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to privacy regulations.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P99_S1	The actions we take to protect confidential information include among other things: monitoring our record retention plans and policies and any changes in state or federal privacy and compliance requirements; maintaining secure storage facilities for tangible records; and limiting access to electronic information in order to safeguard certain information.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P100_S0	In addition, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires that we deliver a notice regarding our privacy policy both at the delivery of an insurance policy and annually thereafter.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Certain exceptions are allowed for sharing of information under joint marketing agreements.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P101_S1	However, certain state laws may require us to obtain a policyholder's consent before we share information.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P102_S0	We have a written information security program with appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect such confidential information.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Cyber security attacks are on the rise throughout the World and while we believe we have taken reasonable steps to secure our customer information we could experience a breach of data.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P102_S2	We closely monitor cyber attack attempts on our system, however, we have no evidence our system has ever been penetrated or client data has been breached.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P102_S3	Nevertheless, it is possible a cyber attack could go undetected but based upon our daily monitoring we believe our exposure to undetected attacks is limited.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P103_S0	If we do not comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information, we could experience adverse consequences, including regulatory sanctions, loss of reputation and litigation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P104_S0	General economic, financial market and political conditions may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected from time to time by general economic, financial market and political conditions, both in the United States and in the foreign countries where our policyowners reside.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P105_S1	These conditions include economic cycles such as: levels of consumer spending; levels of inflation; movements of the financial markets; availability of credit; fluctuations in interest rates, monetary policy or demographics; and legislative and competitive changes.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P106_S0	During periods of economic downturn, such as the ones recently experienced, our insureds may choose not to purchase our insurance products, may terminate existing policies, permit policies to lapse or may choose to reduce the amount of coverage purchased, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P106_S1	Also, our sales of new insurance policies might decrease.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by applicable laws and regulations in the amounts of fees, dividends and other distributions they may make to us.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P107_S1	The inability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us in sufficient amounts for us to conduct our operations could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations or expand our business.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P108_S0	As a holding company, our principal asset is the stock of our subsidiaries.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P108_S1	We rely primarily on statutorily permissible payments from our insurance company subsidiaries, principally through service agreements we have with our subsidiaries, to meet our working capital and other corporate expenses.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P108_S2	The ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to make payments to us is subject to regulation by the states in which they are domiciled, and these payments depend primarily on approved service agreements between us and these subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, the statutory surplus (which is the excess of assets over liabilities as determined under statutory accounting practices prescribed by an insurance company's state of domicile), future statutory earnings (which are earnings as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices) and regulatory restrictions.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Generally, the net assets of our insurance company subsidiaries available for dividends are limited to either the lesser or greater (depending on the state of domicile) of the subsidiary's net gain from operations during the preceding year and 10% of the subsidiary's net statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Except to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of our subsidiaries' creditors, including policyholders, have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors and shareholders.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P110_S1	If any of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates or otherwise reorganizes, our creditors and shareholders will have no right to proceed in their own right against the assets of that subsidiary or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of the subsidiary under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to debt and equity capital and our cost of capital in seeking to expand our business.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P112_S0	The capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility over the past several years.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P112_S1	In some cases, the markets exerted significant downward pressure on availability of debt and equity capital for certain issuers (including short term liquidity and credit capacity).
24090_15_ITEM1A_P112_S2	We believe the availability of debt and equity capital has decreased significantly compared to prior years.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P113_S0	The availability of equity and debt financing to us will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit capacity, as well as the possibility that investors or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P113_S1	Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets may also limit our access to equity capital for us to seek to expand our business.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P113_S2	As such, we may be forced to delay raising debt or equity capital, or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could adversely affect our ability to seek any acquisitions and negatively impact profitability of an acquisition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P114_S0	Unexpected losses in future reporting periods may require us to adjust the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P115_S0	We evaluate our deferred tax asset ( DTA ) quarterly for recoverability based on available evidence.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P115_S1	This process involves management's judgment about assumptions, which are subject to change from period to period due to tax rate changes or variances between our projected operating performance and our actual results.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P116_S0	if any, will be determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P117_S0	The realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry back or carry forward periods under applicable tax law.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we may be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P118_S1	Such an adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and capital position.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P119_S0	We may experience greater risks associated with certain deficiencies recently identified in our BSA Program.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P120_S0	As required by the BSA regulations applicable to insurance companies, we have developed and implemented an anti-money laundering program that includes policies and procedures for complying with applicable BSA program, reporting and recordkeeping requirements and for preventing and detecting potential money laundering and other criminal activity ( BSA Program ).
24090_15_ITEM1A_P120_S1	Based on an internal risk assessment and review we began in the first quarter of 2015, we have identified certain deficiencies in our BSA Program, and we are in the process of addressing them and enhancing the BSA Program in order to mitigate further the risk of inadvertently becoming involved in illegal activity.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P121_S0	We face risk from a 2001 technical error made in our original Registration Statement on Form S-3 covering the Plan and filed with the SEC.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P122_S0	In December 2012 it was discovered that the original Registration Statement on Form S-3 covering the Plan and filed with the SEC was not declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, due to a technical error in the 2001 filing.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P122_S1	As such, sales under the Plan may not have fully complied with an exemption from registration under that Act.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P122_S2	This technical error could grant security holders who purchased shares of Class A common stock a right to rescind their purchases or other damages.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P123_S0	In 2001, we filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") covering the sale of shares of Class A common stock ( 2001 Registration Statement ).
24090_15_ITEM1A_P123_S1	On December 18, 2006, and again on December 18, 2009, the 2001 Registration Statement was amended (the Amendments ).
24090_15_ITEM1A_P124_S0	The 2001 Registration Statement and the Amendments treated the Plan and its predecessors as a Dividend or Interest Reinvestment Plan (a DRIP ) as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act and, accordingly, the 2001 Registration Statement and the Amendments checked the DRIP box on Form S-3 and we treated the Registration Statement and Amendments as effective immediately upon filing with the SEC.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P125_S0	In connection with the preparation of a further amendment to the Registration Statement to be filed on December 18, 2012, and further analysis of the Plan, the Company came to believe that the characterization of the Plan solely as a DRIP may not be appropriate.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P125_S1	As a result, the Company determined not to file a further amendment to the Registration Statement but instead to file a new registration statement covering a Rule 415 continuous offering under the Plan.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P125_S2	On December 18, 2012, we suspended operation of the Plan with respect to the purchase of Class A common stock.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P125_S3	On December 21, 2012, we filed with the SEC a new registration statement pursuant to Rule 415 on Form S-3 with respect to the Plan (the "New Registration Statement"), which was declared effective by the SEC on January 14, 2013.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P126_S0	Despite our full disclosure of this technical error since 2012, if and to the extent participants purchased shares of Class A common stock in the open market that were not effectively registered under the Securities Act, or exempt from such registration, prior to the time the New Registration Statement was declared effective such participants could have certain remedies available to them, including state law claims for rescission and damages.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P126_S1	Should a significant number of these purchasers bring state law claims for rescission or damages it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and reputation and our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P127_S0	The price of our Class A common stock may be adversely affected by decreased participation in the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan (the "Plan").
24090_15_ITEM1A_P128_S0	If an international applicant for insurance submits a Consent to be Contacted form to Citizens with his or her insurance application, then Citizens will submit a copy of the Plan Prospectus once the applicant s insurance policy is fully underwritten.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P129_S0	Most all of our international policyholders participate in the Plan and they invest their policy dividends and benefits in our Class A common stock pursuant to the Plan.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P129_S1	Once a policyholder elects to participate in the Plan, his or her policy benefits are assigned to purchase Citizens Class A common stock under the Plan in the open market.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P129_S2	There is a risk our Class A common stock price could be negatively impacted by a decrease in participation in the Plan.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P129_S3	If fewer policyholders elect to participate in the Plan, or our international premium collections were to decrease as a result of regulatory, economic, or marketing impediments, the trading volume of our Class A stock may decline from its present levels and the demand for our Class A common stock could be negatively impacted.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P130_S0	Control of our Company, through the ownership of our Class B Common Stock, may transfer from our Founder to a 501(c)(3) charitable foundation established by our Founder and we cannot determine whether any change in our management, operations, or operating strategies will occur as a result of such an ownership change.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P131_S0	Harold E. Riley, our Founder, Chairman and CEO, is the beneficial owner of 100% of the Citizens Class B common stock, which is held in the name of the Harold E. Riley Trust ("Trust"), of which he serves as Trustee.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P131_S1	Citizens' Class A and Class B common stock are identical in all respects, except the Class B common stock elects a simple majority of the Board and receives one-half of any cash dividends paid, on a per share basis, to the Class A shares.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P131_S2	Therefore, Mr. Riley controls our Company.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P131_S3	The Class A common stock elects the remainder of the Board.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P131_S4	The Trust documents provide that upon Mr. Riley's death, the Class B common stock will be transferred from the Trust to the Harold E. Riley Foundation, a charitable organization established under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Foundation").
24090_15_ITEM1A_P131_S5	In addition, the Trust documents provide that Mr. Riley may at any time transfer the Class B common stock held by the Trust to the Foundation.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P131_S6	It is unclear what, if any, changes would occur to our board, management structure, or corporate operating strategies as a result of different ownership of our Class B common stock.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P132_S0	There are a substantial number of our shares of Class A common stock issued to our executive officers, directors and management which are eligible for future sale in the public market.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P132_S1	The sale of these shares could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fall.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P133_S0	There were 49,080,114 shares of our Class A common stock issued as of December 31, 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM1A_P133_S1	Our executive officers, directors and management owned approximately 3,170,704 shares of our Class A common stock as of December 31, 2014 , representing approximately 6.5% of our then outstanding Class A common stock.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P133_S2	Almost all of these shares have been registered for public resale and generally may be sold freely.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P133_S3	In the event of a sale of some or all of these shares or the perceived sale of these shares, the market price of our Class A common stock could fall substantially.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P134_S0	The price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P135_S0	Our Class A common stock price has historically fluctuated and is likely to fluctuate in the future and could decline materially because of the volatility of the stock market in general, decreased participation in the Plan referred to above or a variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: quarterly or annual variations in actual or anticipated results of our operations; interest rate fluctuations; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; competition and other factors affecting the life insurance business generally; and conditions in the U.S. and world economies.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P136_S0	The international aspects of our operations, and the specific manner in which we conduct our business in those jurisdictions, may be subject to periodic negative social media publicity, which may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P137_S0	We interface with and distribute our products to residents of foreign countries that may be subject to the risks disclosed in our Item 1A. Risk Factor under the heading, A substantial amount of our revenue comes from residents of foreign countries and is subject to risks associated with widespread political instability, foreign insurance laws and asset transfer restrictions .
24090_15_ITEM1A_P137_S1	Accordingly, from time to time, bloggers or other social media outlets relevant to investors may focus attention on our exposure to these countries and the negative circumstances surrounding their governments, thereby subjecting us to periodic negative publicity.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P137_S2	Negative publicity on investor blogs could impact trading in our stock and ultimately cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fall.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P138_S0	Our Class A common shareholders do not control us and have a limited ability to influence our business policies and corporate actions and are not by themselves able to elect any of our directors.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P139_S0	It is difficult for Class A common shareholders to elect any of our directors or otherwise exert any significant influence over our business.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P140_S0	All of our Class B common stock is currently owned by the Harold E. Riley Trust, of which Harold E. Riley, our founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, is the sole trustee.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P140_S1	Additionally, Harold E. Riley beneficially owns approximately 5% of the issued shares of our Class A common stock.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P141_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as applicable state insurance laws, may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P142_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as various state insurance laws, may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a takeover attempt our shareholders might consider in their best interests.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P142_S1	As a result, our shareholders will be prevented from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our Class A common stock that may be offered by a bidder in a takeover context.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P142_S2	Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P143_S0	The following provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws make it difficult for our Class A shareholders to replace or remove our directors and have other anti-takeover effects that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt:
24090_15_ITEM1A_P144_S0	holders of shares of our Class B common stock elect a simple majority of our board of directors, and all of these shares are owned by the Harold E. Riley Trust; and our board of directors may issue one or more series of preferred stock without the approval of our shareholders.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P145_S0	State insurance laws generally require prior approval of a change in control of an insurance company.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P145_S1	Generally, such laws provide that control over an insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the insurer.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P146_S0	In considering an application to acquire control of an insurer, an insurance commissioner generally will consider such factors as the experience, competence and financial strength of the proposed acquirer, the integrity of the proposed acquirer's board of directors and executive officers, the proposed acquirer's plans for the management and operation of the insurer, and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the acquisition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P146_S1	In addition, a person seeking to acquire control of an insurance company is required in some states to make filings prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and the target insurance company and their affiliates have sufficiently large market shares in particular lines of insurance in those states.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P146_S2	These state insurance requirements may delay, deter or prevent our ability to complete an acquisition.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P147_S0	We have never paid any cash dividends on our Class A common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P148_S0	We have never paid cash dividends on our Class A common stock, as it is our policy to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business.
24090_15_ITEM1A_P148_S1	We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
24090_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	We own our principal office in Austin, Texas, consisting of an 80,000 square foot office building in addition to approximately one acre of land nearby that houses storage facilities.
24090_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	Approximately 50,000 square feet is occupied or reserved for our operations.
24090_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also own a training facility at Lake Buchanan, Texas.
24090_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	In addition, we own other properties in Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana that are incidental to our operations.
24090_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	Since August 6, 1999, the Company has been a defendant in a lawsuit filed in an Austin, Texas District Court, styled Delia Bolanos Andrade, et al., Plaintiffs, v. Citizens Insurance Company of America, et al., Defendants.
24090_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	In consideration of a Texas Supreme Court ruling on the case, the District Court ruled in December of 2009 the plaintiffs must proceed individually, and not as a class, if they intend to pursue their claims against us.
24090_15_ITEM3_P1_S0	There were 17 plaintiffs in the case.
24090_15_ITEM3_P1_S1	The plaintiffs underlying claims allege that certain life insurance policies CICA made available to non-U.S. residents were actually offers and sales of securities that occurred in Texas by unregistered dealers in violation of the Texas securities laws.
24090_15_ITEM3_P1_S2	The remedy sought is rescission and return of the insurance premium payments.
24090_15_ITEM3_P1_S3	The total net insurance premium for the 17 plaintiffs was approximately $150,000.
24090_15_ITEM3_P1_S4	We received a final judgment on this matter in March of 2015 and paid a settlement amount of $183,000.
24090_15_ITEM3_P2_S0	The Company is vigorously defending a number of matters in various stages of development and a number of individual lawsuits, which are immaterial to the Company's financial statements.
24090_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol CIA.
24090_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	Quarterly high and low closing prices per share of our Class A common stock as reported by the NYSE are shown below.
24090_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	The number of stockholders on record on March 31, 2015 was as follows:
24090_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	We have never paid cash dividends on our Class A or B common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
24090_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	We did not purchase any of our equity securities during any quarter in 2012 , 2013 or 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM5_P5_S0	We do not maintain any equity compensation plans or arrangements.
24090_15_ITEM5_P5_S1	Thus, we do not have any securities authorized for issuance under these types of plans, nor have we issued any options, warrants or similar instruments to purchase any of our equity securities.
24090_15_ITEM5_P6_S0	The following graph compares the change in the Company s cumulative total stockholder return on its common stock over a five-year period.
24090_15_ITEM5_P6_S1	Composite and the Hemscott Group Index, a peer group of major U.S.-based insurance companies.
24090_15_ITEM5_P7_S0	The peer group index weights individual company returns for stock market capitalization.
24090_15_ITEM5_P7_S1	The companies included in the peer group index are shown in the following table.
24090_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table presents selected financial data of the Company.
24090_15_ITEM6_P0_S1	This should be read in conjunction with Item 7.

24090_15_ITEM6_P0_S3	"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.
24090_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," for information that may affect the comparability of the financial data contained in the above table.
24090_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following is management's discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations of the Company.
24090_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	It is intended to be a discussion of certain key financial information regarding the Company and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes to this report on Form 10-K.
24090_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	We conduct operations as an insurance holding company emphasizing ordinary life insurance and endowment products in niche markets where we believe we can achieve competitive advantages.
24090_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	As an insurance provider, we collect premiums on an ongoing basis to pay future benefits to our policy and contract holders.
24090_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company derives its revenues principally from 1) premiums earned for insurance coverages provided to insureds; 2) net investment income; and 3) net realized capital gains and losses.
24090_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Profitability of our insurance operations depends heavily upon the Company s underwriting discipline, as we seek to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, management of claims, use of reinsurance, the size of our in force block, actual mortality and morbidity experience, and our ability to manage our expense ratio, which we accomplish through economies of scale and management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses.
24090_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future losses based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the Company s response to competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels.
24090_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Company seeks to price our insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin.
24090_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	For many of our insurance products, the Company is required to obtain approval for the premium rates from state insurance departments.
24090_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	The profitability of fixed annuities, riders and other spread-based product features depends largely on the Company s ability to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on assets and interest credited to policyholders.
24090_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	The investment return, or yield, on invested assets is an important element of the Company s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before benefits are paid.
24090_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	The majority of the Company s invested assets have been held in available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, primarily in asset classes of corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and government obligation bonds.
24090_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	The current and projected low interest rate environment is having a significant impact on the determination of insurance contract liabilities and assets regarding reserves and deferred acquisition costs.
24090_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	The primary investment objective for the Company is to maximize economic value, consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including the management of credit risk and interest rate sensitivity of invested assets, while generating sufficient after-tax income to meet policyholder and corporate obligations.
24090_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Company maintains a conservative investment strategy that may vary based on a variety of factors including business needs, regulatory requirements and tax considerations.
24090_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	In the first quarter of 2015, we announced that we identified that a substantial portion of the life insurance policies issued by our subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702 and 7702A of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") of 1986.
24090_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	As a result, we have established a reserve of $11.4 million for probable expenses and liabilities associated with this tax compliance matter, which amount represents the low end of management s estimated range of those probable expenses and liabilities of $11.4 million to $40.0 million net of tax.
24090_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	This estimated range includes projected toll charges and fees as well as increased claims liability for past claims, reserves increases to bring policies into compliance and other probable liabilities resulting from this tax compliance matter.
24090_15_ITEM7_P10_S3	Our estimated range reflects the uncertainties with respect to the required course of action and other matters unknown at this time.
24090_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	estimable amount for these probable liabilities and expenses which is more likely than other specific amounts within our estimated range.
24090_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	The process of determining our estimated range was a complex undertaking and involved management s judgment based upon a variety of factors known at the time.
24090_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	Given the number of factors considered and the significant variables assumed in establishing our estimated range, actual amounts incurred may exceed our reserve and the high end of our estimated range of expenses and liabilities.
24090_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	In addition, there is a reasonable possibility that we will incur other expenses related to this issue in 2015, including consulting fees and potential system costs.
24090_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	We are not able to reasonably estimate these amounts as of the reporting date.
24090_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	The 2014 financial results are driven by our conservative business management and traditional life product sales.
24090_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	The interest rate environment continues to impact our results and our industry as investment yields are an integral component of our business operations.
24090_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Net investment income increased 12.2% and 15.4% for 2014 and 2013 , respectively, as rates have risen in 2014 compared to the prior two years.
24090_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	The average yield on the consolidated investment portfolio has changed from a yield of 3.81% in 2012 up to 4.11% in 2013 and increasing to a yield of 4.21% in 2014 as rates have risen slightly and our new investments have been focused on municipals and corporates.
24090_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	The increase in the investment asset balances due to premium revenue growth has also contributed to the increase in net investment income.
24090_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	During 2014 , claims and surrenders expense increased 6.0% from the comparable period in 2013 primarily due to an increase in surrender benefits in the life segment compared to the 2013 levels.
24090_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	The home service segment was impacted in 2012 by Hurricane Isaac which hit the Louisiana coast on August 29, 2012 and caused increased property claims.
24090_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	2014 change in reserves resulted in liability increases resulting from increased sales of endowment products that build up reserves at a faster pace than whole life longer term mortality based products.
24090_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	Additionally, the sustained low interest rate environment also results in a higher reserve development due to the lower interest yield assumptions over the past several years.
24090_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	General expense increased in 2014 by $10.0 million primarily due to the tax compliance issue noted above relating to product qualification under IRC section 7702 and remediation costs that have been identified.
24090_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	We completed the acquisition of MGLIC in the first quarter of 2014 and the related results have been included in our financial results.
24090_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	MGLIC is now a wholly owned subsidiary of SPLIC and is reported in the home service segment.
24090_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	For over thirty-five years, CICA and its predecessors have accepted policy applications from foreign nationals for U.S. Dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies.
24090_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	We make our insurance products available using third-party marketing organizations and independent marketing consultants.
24090_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Endowment product sales have been on the rise and represented approximately 76.1% of new sales.
24090_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	The Company offers a ten, fifteen and twenty year endowment and our top selling endowment is a product that matures at age sixty-five.
24090_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	We also introduced a new product in 2012 that is an endowment at age eighteen with a payout over four or five years.
24090_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Through the domestic market of our Life Insurance segment, we provide ordinary whole life, credit life insurance, and final expense policies to middle and lower income families and individuals in certain markets in the mountain west, mid-west and southern U.S.
24090_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	The majority of our domestic revenues are generated by the policies of domestic life insurance companies we have acquired since 1987.
24090_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	We provide final expense ordinary and industrial life insurance to middle and lower income individuals in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	Our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through a home service marketing distribution system utilizing employee-agents who work on a route system to collect premiums and service policyholders, and through networks of funeral homes that collect premiums and provide personal policyholder service.
24090_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Significant economic issues impacting our business and industry currently and into the future are discussed below.
24090_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	It is predicted that the interest rate environment will remain low for the foreseeable future, which translates into lower profit margins for insurers.
24090_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	We have been impacted by the historically low interest rate environment over the past several years as our fixed income investment portfolio, primarily invested in callable securities, has been reinvested at lower yields.
24090_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	The Company s conservative investment strategy has not changed but we have focused new purchases into holding of state, municipalities and essential service issuers compared to our historical investment in U.S. government holdings.
24090_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	Our investment earnings also impact the reserve and Deferred Acquisition Costs ( DAC ) balances, as assumptions are used in the development of the balances.
24090_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Due to the recent decline in investment yields on our portfolio, our projection of long-term investment returns has declined.
24090_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	This has resulted in increasing the reserves on policies issued in the current year, as well as reducing the DAC asset.
24090_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	As an increasing percentage of the world population reaches retirement age, we believe we will benefit from increased demand for living benefit products rather than death products, as aging baby boomers will require cash accumulation to pay expenses to meet their lifetime income needs.
24090_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	Our ordinary life products are designed to accumulate cash values to provide for living expenses in a policy owner's later years, while continuously providing a death benefit.
24090_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	We believe there is a trend toward consolidation of domestic life insurance companies, due to significant losses incurred by the life insurance industry as a result of the credit crisis and recent economic pressures, as well as increasing costs of regulatory compliance for domestic life insurance companies.
24090_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	We believe this trend should be a benefit to our acquisition strategy as more complementary acquisition candidates may become available for us to consider.
24090_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Many of the events and trends affecting the life insurance industry have had an impact on the life reinsurance industry.
24090_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	These events have led to a decline in the availability of reinsurance.
24090_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	While we currently cede a limited amount of our primary insurance business to reinsurers, we may find it difficult to obtain reinsurance in the future, forcing us to seek reinsurers who are more expensive to us.
24090_15_ITEM7_P31_S3	If we cannot obtain affordable reinsurance coverage, either our net exposures will increase or we will have to reduce our underwriting commitments.
24090_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	While our management has more than 41 years of experience in writing life insurance policies for foreign residents, changes related to foreign government laws and regulations and application of them, along with currency controls affecting our foreign resident insureds could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	On August 1, 2011, SPLIC entered into assumption reinsurance agreements with Escude Life Insurance Company in Rehabilitation, and Benton Life Insurance Company in Rehabilitation.
24090_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	At the time the agreements were executed, both companies were under receivership with the Louisiana Department of Insurance.
24090_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	In total, SPLIC assumed approximately $4.5 million in reserve liabilities and received approximately $4.6 million in cash, with a minimal reinsurance ceding commission being paid.
24090_15_ITEM7_P33_S3	These transactions are accounted for under business combination accounting and are not deemed material.
24090_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	On March 7, 2014, the Company acquired Magnolia Guaranty Life Insurance Company ("MGLIC") in the amount of $5.2 million.
24090_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	MGLIC is a Mississippi domiciled company that began writing business in 1992 and issues primarily industrial life policies through independent funeral homes in the state of Mississippi.
24090_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	We recorded $0.1 million of goodwill as a result of this transaction.
24090_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	MGLIC is reported in our home service segment.
24090_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	A discussion of consolidated results is presented below, followed by a discussion of Segment Operations and financial results by segment.
24090_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Insurance revenues are primarily generated from premium revenues and investment income.
24090_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	In addition, realized gains and losses on investment holdings can significantly impact revenues from year to year.
24090_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Premium income derived from life, accident and health, and property insurance sales, increased 7.0% during 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	The increase resulted primarily from renewal premiums, which increased 6.5% and 5.3% in the life segment for 2014 and 2013 and totaled $159.7 million , $150.3 million and $144.7 million on the consolidated level in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
24090_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	New sales, termed as first year premiums, increased 13.2% , 4.0% , and 6.1% in the life segment in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
24090_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	Endowment sales represent a significant portion of new business sales internationally with the 20 year endowment and endowment to age 65 as our top products.
24090_15_ITEM7_P38_S4	In addition, most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision, which allows the policyholder to use cash value of a policy to pay premiums.
24090_15_ITEM7_P38_S5	The policy loan asset balance increased 10.6% and 13.7% in 2014 and 2013 , year over year.
24090_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Net investment income increased to $41.1 million in 2014 compared to $36.6 million in 2013 , due to an increase in yields from new investments primarily in municipal and corporate issues and as we experienced higher average invested assets as a result of investment of new premium revenue.
24090_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	Net investment income performance is summarized as follows.
24090_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	We have traditionally invested in fixed maturity securities with a large percent held in callable issues.
24090_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	In recent years, we have experienced significant call activity related to fixed maturity security holdings due to the historically low interest rate environment.
24090_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	The low yield rates have leveled off and are now beginning to rise as noted in the table above.
24090_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	If market interest rates begin to rise, our call risk will diminish and our portfolio yield will rise more slowly over time, as new money investments would be made at higher rates.
24090_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Investment income from fixed maturity securities accounted for approximately 84.9% of total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	We have increased our investment purchases of corporate and municipal securities over the past several years, focusing on utility service sectors in these security categories.
24090_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	In addition, we currently have $67.8 million invested in equity securities related to bond and stock mutual funds as these securities offer a competitive yield with a shorter duration.
24090_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Investment income from fixed maturity investments increased for the year of 2014 due to a rise in overall bond yields and an increase in the portfolio from new money investment purchases as noted above relative to the fixed maturity portfolio.
24090_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	In addition, the increase in the policy loans asset balance, which represents policyholders utilizing their accumulated policy cash value, contributed to the increase to investment income.
24090_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments .
24090_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	In 2014 , investment gains on fixed maturities of $0.4 million were recorded due to calls by issuers and several sales and net gains on equity securities of $49,000 was related to the sale of several mutual funds in the current year.
24090_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	In 2013 , we sold two equity bond funds which resulted in a realized loss of $0.4 million.
24090_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	The Company sold equity mutual funds in 2012 , which were previously impaired, and realized gains of $0.6 million .
24090_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Realized investment gains (losses) are as follows.
24090_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Included in net realized investment gains and losses are OTTI on investments.
24090_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	We recorded an OTTI write-down in 2014 of $427,000 related to two bond mutual fund issuers we no longer intend to hold until recovery of market value.
24090_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	In 2012 the write down related to a coal powered energy issuer.
24090_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Decrease in Fair Value of Warrants .
24090_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	In 2012, all of the remaining warrants outstanding were either exercised or converted into our Class A common stock, due to an election by the warrant holders, or expiration.
24090_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	We recognized a gain on the decrease in fair value of warrants of $0.5 million in 2012.
24090_15_ITEM7_P47_S3	The 2012 gain was the result of the significant decrease in the number of warrants outstanding due to expirations and exercises.
24090_15_ITEM7_P47_S4	The warrant liability was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which projects the future value of the warrants when they expire.
24090_15_ITEM7_P47_S5	Current accounting standards require the change in the value of the warrant liability be recorded as a component of revenues.
24090_15_ITEM7_P47_S6	When the liability increased we incurred a loss, and when the liability decreased we recognized income.
24090_15_ITEM7_P47_S7	There were no warrants outstanding during 2013 or 2014.
24090_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	As noted in the table below, claims and surrenders increased from $64.4 million in 2013 to $68.3 million in 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	The Company monitors death claims based upon expectations.
24090_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	These values may routinely fluctuate from year to year.
24090_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Policy surrenders increased in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , but remained at a level that represents approximately 0.6% of direct ordinary whole life insurance inforce.
24090_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	The increase in surrender expense is primarily related to our international business and is expected to increase over time due to the aging of this block of business.
24090_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	A significant portion of surrenders relates to policies that have been in force over fifteen years and no longer have a surrender charge associated with them.
24090_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	Total direct insurance inforce reported in 2014 was $4.9 billion compared to $4.7 billion in 2013 and $4.6 billion 2012 .
24090_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	Endowment benefits increased in 2014 compared to 2013 and 2012 amounts.
24090_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	We have a series of international policies that carry an immediate endowment benefit of an amount selected by the policy owner.
24090_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	These benefits have been popular in the Pacific Rim and Latin America, where the Company has experienced increased interest in our guaranteed products in recent years.
24090_15_ITEM7_P54_S2	Like policy dividends, annual guaranteed endowments are factored into the premium and, as such, the increase has no impact on profitability.
24090_15_ITEM7_P54_S3	The Company expects these benefits to continue to increase as this block of business increases and persists.
24090_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	Property claims decreased 24% to approximately $1.5 million in 2014 compared with the amount reported for 2013 due a decrease in weather related claims.
24090_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	The Hurricane Issac claims experience in 2012 included $0.5 million of losses within our retention limits.
24090_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	The change in future policy benefit reserves has increased 11.6% and 11.3% in 2014 and 2013 due primarily to the current low interest rate environment necessitating higher reserves for policies issued in the last few years due to lower long term yield projections compared to prior assumptions.
24090_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	In addition, we continue to experience growth in new sales of endowment products, which require higher initial reserve levels, than whole life products.
24090_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	Endowment sales totaled approximately $16.9 million , $14.3 million and $14.3 million in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
24090_15_ITEM7_P56_S3	In addition, we recorded an increase to reserves of $1.4 million due to estimated required additional death benefits on those life products we intend to remediate for compliance with IRC sections as noted above.
24090_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	Policyholder dividends have risen at a rate corresponding with the growth rate in new international life insurance premiums.
24090_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	The Company issues long duration participating policies to foreign residents that are expected to pay dividends to policyholders based upon actual experience.
24090_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	Policyholder dividends are factored into the premiums and have no impact on profitability.
24090_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Commission expense fluctuates in a direct relationship to new and renewal insurance premiums and has increased 8.8% in 2014 compared to 2013 as premium revenues have increased.
24090_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	Total general expenses have increased significantly on a consolidated basis in 2014 due to the tax compliance issue we identified in 2015, which resulted in a $10.2 million expense for future liabilities recorded in the current year.
24090_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	In 2013, claims cost increased compared to 2012 , related to our self insurance health plan for our employees resulting in approximately $0.5 million increase to our overall benefit expenses.
24090_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	$0.2 million related to assistance with operations projects.
24090_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	In 2013 , we also settled litigation in the amount of $0.2 million which was filed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina by the Louisiana Attorney General against all insurers writing homeowner policies in Louisiana.
24090_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	We perform an expense study on an annual basis, utilizing an enterprise-wide time study, and we adjust cost allocations among entities as needed based upon this review.
24090_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	Any allocation changes are reflected in the segment operations, but do not impact total expenses.
24090_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Capitalized deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") were $32.1 million , $29.4 million and $29.1 million in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
24090_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	These costs will vary based upon successful efforts related to newly issued policies and renewal business.
24090_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	Significantly lower amounts are capitalized related to renewal business in correlation with the lower commissions paid on that business compared to first year business which have higher commission rates.
24090_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is impacted by persistency and may fluctuate from year to year.
24090_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	Amortization in 2014 increased as we experienced lower persistency in the life segment.
24090_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	Amortization costs increased in 2013 compared to 2012 as persistency began to decline from previous levels primarily in the life segment.
24090_15_ITEM7_P63_S3	In addition, the prolonged low interest rate environment impacted the assumptions used in the development of the DAC asset for new policies issued.
24090_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Cost of Customer Relationships Acquired and Other Intangibles .
24090_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	The lower amortization in 2014 was related primarily to lower amortization in SPLIC offset somewhat by amortization in MGLIC which was not in prior years amortization.
24090_15_ITEM7_P64_S2	The amortization level recorded in 2013 and 2012 was consistent due to no acquisition changes.
24090_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	Federal income tax expense was $3.7 million , $2.1 million and $1.5 million in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of (134.0)% , 30.8% and 25.0% , respectively.
24090_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	The current year impact is the result of the tax compliance issue we identified in 2015 which impacted our current year effective tax rate negatively by approximately $3.5 million due to approximately $10.0 million of these costs not being deductible for tax.
24090_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	Additionally, the Company set up a tax expense of $2.1 million for an uncertain tax position that is effecting the 2014 tax rate.
24090_15_ITEM7_P65_S3	The Company began purchasing tax-exempt state and local bonds in the second half of 2011 and continued to do so the last several years in the non-insurance companies where the full tax benefit can be realized.
24090_15_ITEM7_P65_S4	In addition, the fair value change related to outstanding warrants of $0.5 million was reported as an increase in revenues in 2012 which was not taxable and also impacted our corporate tax rate.
24090_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	Differences between our effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate result from income and expense items that are treated differently for financial reporting and tax purposes.
24090_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	Our business is comprised of three operating business segments, as detailed below.
24090_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	Our insurance operations are the primary focus of the Company, as those segments generate the majority of our income.
24090_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	The amount of insurance, number of policies, and average face amounts of policies issued during the periods indicated are shown below.
24090_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	These segments are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
24090_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	The Company evaluates profit and loss performance based on net income before federal income taxes.
24090_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	Our Life Insurance segment primarily issues ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies in U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents in approximately 30 countries through approximately 1,500 independent marketing consultants, and domestically through over 400 independent marketing firms and consultants throughout the United States.
24090_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	Premium revenues increased for 2014 compared to 2013 and 2012 , due to higher international renewal premiums, which have experienced strong persistency as this block of insurance ages.
24090_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	First year premiums increased in the current year, reflecting improved new business production in all products internationally.
24090_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	Sales from Colombia, Ecuador, Taiwan and Venezuela represented the majority of the first year premium increase.
24090_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	Life Insurance premium breakout is detailed below.
24090_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	Endowment sales represent a significant portion of new business sales internationally, as these products continue to exceed our whole life sales in the current markets.
24090_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	In addition, most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision, which allows the policyholder to use cash value of a policy to pay premiums.

24090_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	A number of domestic life insurance companies we acquired had blocks of accident and health insurance policies.
24090_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	We entered a coinsurance agreement with an unaffiliated insurance company, Unified Life Insurance Company ("Unified"), under which it assumes substantially all of our accident and health policies.
24090_15_ITEM7_P79_S2	The coinsurance agreement allows for full assumption by Unified of this business upon approval by state insurance authorities.
24090_15_ITEM7_P79_S3	The decrease in premiums for 2014 and 2013 was due to the fact that Unified received state approval in many states and has obtained over 98% assumption of all policies through 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	Net investment income has increased as the annual yield has increased 19 basis points in this segment from 2013 , as discussed in the Consolidated Results of Operations above.

24090_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	Death claims expense decreased 3.0% in 2014 and decreased 21.1% in 2013 compared to 2012 .
24090_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	Mortality experience has reflected improved results the past two years which is likely due to increased endowment sales and a client base that results in lower deaths reported.
24090_15_ITEM7_P83_S2	Mortality experience is closely monitored by the Company as a key performance indicator and these amounts were within expected levels.
24090_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	The increase in surrender expense is primarily related to our international business and is expected to increase over time due to the aging of this block of business.
24090_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	The majority of policy surrender benefits paid is attributable to our international business and was related to policies that have been in force over fifteen years, where surrender charges are no longer applicable.
24090_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	Endowment benefit expense results from the election by policyholders of a product feature that provides an annual benefit.
24090_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	This is a fixed benefit over the life of the contract, and this expense will increase with new sales and improved persistency.
24090_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	Other policy benefits increased in the current year due primarily to premium deposits and dividend accumulations policyholder liability accounts which have increased as these amounts credit a 4% interest rate, making them an attractive deposit in this low interest rate environment.
24090_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Increase in Future Policy Benefit Reserves .
24090_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	Policy benefit reserves in 2014 increased compared to the same period in 2013 , primarily from the effect of the current low interest rate environment on reserve development for policies issued in the last few years which have higher reserve build up compared to prior issue years.
24090_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	The accounting guidance of long duration contracts we sell requires the Company to lock in the original assumptions such as mortality, interest, surrenders and expenses at the time the initial policies are written, therefore gains or losses attributable to actual experience that differs from the original assumptions flows through the income statement in the period where in the differences occur.
24090_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	In addition, reserves have risen year over year for all periods presented due to the increased sales of endowment products, which build up reserve balances more quickly compared to other life product sales.
24090_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	Endowment sales totaled approximately $16.9 million , $14.3 million and $14.3 million , representing approximately 76.1% , 73.0% and 76.0% of total new first year premium in 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively.

24090_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	The premiums in this segment increased 5.7% in 2014 due to $2.0 million of premiums recorded related to the MGLIC acquisition in the current year.
24090_15_ITEM7_P97_S1	Premiums for 2013 compared to 2012 were flat as there was an increase in 2012 of approximately $180,000 of single premium revenues related to a system error in recording increasing policy benefits that are used to pay for paid up additions and were reflected as a one time adjustment as noted below under Policyholders' dividends.

24090_15_ITEM7_P106_S1	The current year change in reserves was minimal, excluding MGLIC additional reserves, as premiums were relatively flat and lapse experience was comparable for all three periods presented.
24090_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	The increase in 2012 compared to subsequent years resulted from a manual adjustment that was properly set up in 2012 in the policy administration system to appropriately reflect increasing policy values from annual paid up additions.
24090_15_ITEM7_P108_S0	segment earnings for the year 2012.
24090_15_ITEM7_P108_S1	The reserve liability had been previously set up relative to this policy feature and was decreased by $35,000 based upon the system calculated value.
24090_15_ITEM7_P109_S0	Commission expense, excluding MGLIC amounts of $0.5 million, were comparable for all three periods presented based upon premiums collected.
24090_15_ITEM7_P109_S1	We consolidated some collection routes in 2012, which resulted in elimination of one district office and its related staffing thereby also reducing some commission expense.
24090_15_ITEM7_P110_S0	These expenses are allocated by segment based upon an annual expense study performed by the Company.
24090_15_ITEM7_P110_S1	2014 amounts are higher by $2.4 million as compared to 2013 .

24090_15_ITEM7_P110_S3	In addition, expenses in 2014 increased as MGLIC related expenses are included in this segment in the current year.
24090_15_ITEM7_P110_S4	Overall expenses were up in 2013 compared to 2012 due to an increase in employee health claims, as we are self insured and due to temporary employee labor costs as we had added staffing to assist with operations projects.
24090_15_ITEM7_P110_S5	In 2013, we also settled litigation in the amount of $0.2 million which was filed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina by the Louisiana Attorney General against all insurers writing homeowner policies in Louisiana.

24090_15_ITEM7_P113_S0	This segment represents the administrative support entities to the insurance operations whose revenues are primarily intercompany and have been eliminated in consolidation under GAAP, which typically results in a segment loss.
24090_15_ITEM7_P113_S1	In 2012 the fair value adjustment related to the Company's warrants to purchase Class A common stock were recorded which resulted in a gain of $0.5 million.
24090_15_ITEM7_P113_S2	These amounts fluctuated due to the movement in our Class A common stock price and fair value calculation for warrants using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
24090_15_ITEM7_P113_S3	There were no warrants outstanding during 2014 or 2013.
24090_15_ITEM7_P114_S0	Financial stability and the prevention of capital erosion are important investment considerations for the Company.
24090_15_ITEM7_P115_S0	A primary investment goal is the conservation of assets due to the long-term nature of a significant portion of our liabilities.
24090_15_ITEM7_P115_S1	The administration of our investment portfolios is handled internally, pursuant to board-approved investment guidelines, with all trading activity approved by a committee of each entity s respective board of directors.

24090_15_ITEM7_P119_S0	The current year decline in U.S. government-sponsored securities is due to call activity from this sector and reinvestment into fixed maturity corporate and municipal bond categories.
24090_15_ITEM7_P119_S1	The Company has increased investments in municipals primarily related to Build America taxable bonds, essential services and corporate issuer holdings in the utility sector.
24090_15_ITEM7_P120_S0	At December 31, 2014 , investments in fixed maturity and equity securities were 89.8% of our total cash, cash equivalents and investments.

24090_15_ITEM7_P122_S0	Yields on investment assets vary between segment operations due to different portfolio mixes and durations in the segments.
24090_15_ITEM7_P122_S1	The life segment previously invested more in U.S. Government securities however over the past few years it has invested in municipal and corporate issuers and is now more similar to the home service segment which has had concentrations primarily in the corporate and municipal sectors.
24090_15_ITEM7_P123_S0	Credit ratings reported for the periods indicated are assigned by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ("NRSRO") such as Moody s Investors Service, Standard Poor s and Fitch Ratings.
24090_15_ITEM7_P123_S1	A credit rating assigned by a NRSRO is a quality based rating, with AAA representing the highest quality and D the lowest, with BBB and above being considered investment grade.
24090_15_ITEM7_P123_S2	In addition, the Company may use credit ratings of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") Securities Valuation Office ("SVO") as assigned, if there is no NRSRO rating.

24090_15_ITEM7_P129_S0	The tables below represent the Company s detailed exposure of municipal holdings in Louisiana and Texas, which comprise the most significant state concentrations of the total municipal portfolio as of December 31, 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM7_P130_S0	The Company invests in municipal securities of issuers in the state of Louisiana and receives a credit that reduces its premium tax liability in that state.
24090_15_ITEM7_P130_S1	At December 31, 2014 , total holdings of municipal securities in Louisiana represented 8.8% of all municipal holdings based upon fair value.

24090_15_ITEM7_P131_S0	There were no other states or individual issuer holdings that represented or exceeded 10% of the total municipal portfolio as of December 31, 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM7_P132_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of our fixed maturity and equity securities at least quarterly.
24090_15_ITEM7_P133_S0	The Company monitors all debt and equity securities on an on-going basis relative to changes in credit ratings, market prices, earnings trends and financial performance, in addition to specific region or industry reviews.
24090_15_ITEM7_P134_S0	The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on a case-by-case evaluation of underlying reasons for the decline in fair value.
24090_15_ITEM7_P135_S0	The Company determines other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) by reviewing all relevant evidence related to the specific security issuer as well as the Company's intent to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost.
24090_15_ITEM7_P136_S0	When an OTTI has occurred, the amount of the OTTI recognized in earnings depends on whether the Company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis.
24090_15_ITEM7_P136_S1	If the Company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, an OTTI is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_15_ITEM7_P136_S2	If the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Company is required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the OTTI will be separated into the following: a) the amount representing the credit loss; and b) the amount related to all other factors.
24090_15_ITEM7_P136_S3	The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings.
24090_15_ITEM7_P136_S4	The amount of the total OTTI related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_15_ITEM7_P136_S5	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_15_ITEM7_P136_S6	The new amortized cost is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value.
24090_15_ITEM7_P137_S0	We recorded a write-down in 2014 of $0.4 million as a result of our OTTI analysis.
24090_15_ITEM7_P137_S1	There were no OTTI impairments recorded during 2013.
24090_15_ITEM7_P137_S2	We recorded an OTTI write-down in 2012 of $1.3 million related to one coal powered energy issuer debt security holding which has a maturity date in 2017.
24090_15_ITEM7_P137_S3	Based upon our analysis of whether declines in fair value below cost are temporary or other-than-temporary, management believes that our investments in fixed maturity investments at December 31, 2014 were not impaired, and no additional other-than-temporary losses need to be recorded.
24090_15_ITEM7_P138_S0	Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities available-for-sale amounted to $2.5 million as of December 31, 2014 and $13.1 million as of December 31, 2013 .
24090_15_ITEM7_P138_S1	This decrease in gross unrealized losses was due to a decrease in the interest rate environment.
24090_15_ITEM7_P138_S2	There were $0.9 million and $0.4 million of gross unrealized losses on equity securities as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
24090_15_ITEM7_P139_S0	As is customary among insurance companies, our insurance company subsidiaries reinsure with other companies portions of the life insurance risks they underwrite.
24090_15_ITEM7_P139_S1	A primary purpose of reinsurance agreements is to enable an insurance company to reduce the amount of risk on any particular life and, by reinsuring the amount exceeding the maximum amount the insurance company is willing to retain, to insure individuals in amounts larger than it could without such agreements.
24090_15_ITEM7_P139_S2	Even though a portion of the risk may be reinsured, our insurance company subsidiaries remain liable to perform all the obligations imposed by the policies issued by them and could be liable if their reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements.
24090_15_ITEM7_P140_S0	We believe we have established appropriate reinsurance coverage based upon our net retained insured liabilities compared to our surplus.
24090_15_ITEM7_P141_S0	The effect of reinsurance on premiums is as follows.
24090_15_ITEM7_P142_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries monitor the solvency of their reinsurers in seeking to minimize the risk of loss in the event of default by a reinsurer.
24090_15_ITEM7_P143_S0	The primary reinsurers of our insurance subsidiaries are large, well-capitalized entities.
24090_15_ITEM7_P144_S0	The effect of reinsurance on life insurance in force is as follows.
24090_15_ITEM7_P145_S0	Virtually all of the Company's non-credit accident and health insurance has been reinsured and is administered by Unified Life Insurance Company, an unaffiliated party.
24090_15_ITEM7_P145_S1	The reinsurance recoverables under this agreement are collateralized by assets held in a trust for the benefit of the reinsured policies.
24090_15_ITEM7_P146_S0	The Company monitors the credit ratings of our life and property reinsurers.
24090_15_ITEM7_P146_S1	The ratings by A.M. Best Company range from B+ (Good) to A+ (Superior).
24090_15_ITEM7_P147_S0	SPFIC has first and second event catastrophe reinsurance coverage of $10.0 million per event and a retention level of $500,000 per event.
24090_15_ITEM7_P147_S1	Thus, the first $500,000 of incurred claims and any claims in excess of $10.0 million are SPFIC's responsibility.
24090_15_ITEM7_P148_S0	The reinsurance premium for first event catastrophe reinsurance was $967,000 , $1,107,000 and $1,025,000 in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
24090_15_ITEM7_P149_S0	Liquidity refers to a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the needs of its operations.
24090_15_ITEM7_P149_S1	Liquidity is managed on insurance operations to ensure stable and reliable sources of cash flows to meet obligations and is provided by a variety of sources.
24090_15_ITEM7_P150_S0	Our liquidity requirements are met primarily by funds provided from operations.
24090_15_ITEM7_P150_S1	Premium deposits and revenues, investment income and investment maturities are the primary sources of funds, while investment purchases, policy benefits, and operating expenses are the primary uses of funds.
24090_15_ITEM7_P150_S2	We historically have not had to liquidate investments to provide cash flow, and there were no liquidity issues in 2014 or 2013 .
24090_15_ITEM7_P150_S3	Our investments consist of 66.4% of marketable debt securities and 6.6% of equity securities classified as available-for-sale that could be readily converted to cash for liquidity needs.
24090_15_ITEM7_P151_S0	A primary liquidity concern is the risk of an extraordinary level of early policyholder withdrawals.
24090_15_ITEM7_P151_S1	We include provisions within our insurance policies, such as surrender charges, that help limit and discourage early withdrawals.
24090_15_ITEM7_P151_S2	Since these contractual withdrawals, as well as the level of surrenders experienced, have been largely consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management, our associated cash outflows have, historically, not had an adverse impact on our overall liquidity.
24090_15_ITEM7_P152_S0	Individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy.
24090_15_ITEM7_P152_S1	Cash flow projections and cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios are also performed annually to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy.
24090_15_ITEM7_P153_S0	We currently anticipate that available liquidity sources and future cash flows will be adequate to meet our needs for funds.
24090_15_ITEM7_P154_S0	Cash flows from our insurance operations historically have been sufficient to meet current needs.
24090_15_ITEM7_P154_S1	Cash flows from operating activities were $97.9 million , $81.4 million and $69.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
24090_15_ITEM7_P154_S2	We have traditionally also had significant cash flows from both scheduled and unscheduled fixed maturity security calls, maturities, redemptions, and prepayments, which totaled $71.4 million , $92.7 million and $326.7 million in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
24090_15_ITEM7_P154_S3	These cash flows, for the most part, are reinvested in fixed income securities.
24090_15_ITEM7_P154_S4	Net cash outflows from investment activity totaled $104.0 million , $84.9 million and $50.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
24090_15_ITEM7_P154_S5	The outflows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 , primarily related to the investment of excess cash and cash equivalents generated from operations during 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM7_P154_S6	The Company's cash flows from financing activities were $2.1 million in 2014 , $1.7 million in 2013 and $3.8 million in 2012 .
24090_15_ITEM7_P155_S0	In the first quarter of 2015, we announced that we identified that a substantial portion of the life insurance policies issued by our subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702 and 7702A of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") of 1986.
24090_15_ITEM7_P155_S1	As a result, we have established a reserve of $11.4 million for probable expenses and liabilities associated with this tax compliance matter, which amount represents the low end of management s estimated range of those probable expenses and liabilities of $11.4 million to $40.0 million net of tax.
24090_15_ITEM7_P155_S2	This estimated range includes projected toll charges and fees as well as increased claims liability for past claims, reserves increases to bring policies into compliance and other probable liabilities resulting from this tax compliance matter.
24090_15_ITEM7_P155_S3	Our estimated range reflects the uncertainties with respect to the required course of action and other matters unknown at this time.
24090_15_ITEM7_P155_S4	Currently, management believes there is not a specific estimable amount for these probable liabilities and expenses which is more likely than other specific amounts within our estimated range.
24090_15_ITEM7_P156_S0	The process of determining our estimated range was a complex undertaking and involved management s judgment based upon a variety of factors known at the time.
24090_15_ITEM7_P156_S1	Given the number of factors considered and the significant variables assumed in establishing our estimated range, actual amounts incurred may exceed our reserve and may exceed the high end of our estimated range of expenses and liabilities.
24090_15_ITEM7_P157_S0	This tax compliance issue impacts our policyholders and their tax liabilities relative to these products that fail 7702 qualifications and will not be remediated.
24090_15_ITEM7_P157_S1	The exposure related to future sales or products in force is unknown at this time.
24090_15_ITEM7_P158_S0	decide to surrender their policies due to this issue which would subsequently result in higher cash outflows due to an increase in surrender activity.
24090_15_ITEM7_P159_S0	The NAIC has established minimum capital requirements in the form of RBC.
24090_15_ITEM7_P159_S1	RBC considers the type of business written by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company's business to develop a minimum level of capital called "Authorized Control Level Risk-based Capital" and compares this level to an adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves.
24090_15_ITEM7_P159_S2	Should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk-based capital fall below 200%, a series of remedial actions by the affected company would be required.
24090_15_ITEM7_P160_S0	At December 31, 2014 , all of our insurance subsidiaries were above the required minimum RBC levels.
24090_15_ITEM7_P161_S0	In 2013, CICA contributed 50,000 shares of Citizens, Inc.
24090_15_ITEM7_P161_S1	Class A common stock to CNLIC as a capital contribution due to minimum capital and surplus considerations.
24090_15_ITEM7_P161_S2	The contributed shares had a fair market contributed value of and $0.4 million .
24090_15_ITEM7_P161_S3	These shares were subsequently purchased by Citizens, Inc., the ultimate parent, for $0.4 million cash in 2013.
24090_15_ITEM7_P161_S4	Citizens, Inc. also purchased Class A Common shares in 2012 from CTI with an approximate fair value of $0.5 million.
24090_15_ITEM7_P161_S5	These transactions have been eliminated under consolidation accounting rules.
24090_15_ITEM7_P162_S0	We have committed to the following contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 , with the payments due by the period indicated below:
24090_15_ITEM7_P163_S0	The payments related to the future policy benefits and policy claims payable reflected in the table above have been projected utilizing assumptions based upon our historical experience and anticipated future experience.
24090_15_ITEM7_P164_S0	The Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2014 and, therefore, does not expect any future effects on the Company's financial condition related to any such arrangements.
24090_15_ITEM7_P165_S0	We do not utilize special purpose entities as investment vehicles, nor are there any such entities in which we have an investment that engages in speculative activities of any nature, and we do not use such investments to hedge our investment positions.
24090_15_ITEM7_P166_S0	Citizens is a holding company and has had minimal operations of its own.
24090_15_ITEM7_P166_S1	Our assets consist of the capital stock of our subsidiaries, cash, fixed income securities, mutual funds and investment real estate.
24090_15_ITEM7_P166_S2	Our cash flows depend primarily upon the availability of statutorily permissible payments, primarily payments under management agreements from our two primary life insurance subsidiaries, CICA and SPLIC.
24090_15_ITEM7_P166_S3	The ability to make payments is limited by applicable laws and regulations of Colorado, CICA's state of domicile, and Louisiana, SPLIC's state of domicile, which subject insurance operations to significant regulatory restrictions.
24090_15_ITEM7_P166_S4	These laws and regulations require, among other things, that these insurance subsidiaries maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company.
24090_15_ITEM7_P167_S0	We historically have not relied upon dividends from subsidiaries for our cash flow needs.
24090_15_ITEM7_P167_S1	However, CICA and SPLIC both dividend available funds from time to time in relation to new acquisition target strategies.
24090_15_ITEM7_P168_S0	CICA has contributed amounts in the form of dividends to Citizens totaling $5.3 million and $5.4 million in 2014 and 2012 , respectively.
24090_15_ITEM7_P169_S0	Additionally, a substantial portion of our international policyholders invest their policy cash dividends and benefits in our Class A common stock through our Stock Investment Plan (the Plan ).
24090_15_ITEM7_P169_S1	Once a policyholder elects to participate in the Plan, their policy benefits can be used to purchase Citizens Class A common stock through the Plan in the open market.
24090_15_ITEM7_P169_S2	In addition, our existing holders of Class A common stock, our employees and our independent consultants are eligible to participate in the Plan.
24090_15_ITEM7_P169_S3	If fewer policyholders elect to participate in the Plan, or if our international premium collections were to decrease as a result of regulatory or marketing impediments, the trading volume of our Class A common stock may decline from its present levels.
24090_15_ITEM7_P170_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
24090_15_ITEM7_P170_S1	Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM7_P170_S2	While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available.
24090_15_ITEM7_P170_S3	Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
24090_15_ITEM7_P171_S0	Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.
24090_15_ITEM7_P172_S0	No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting policies.
24090_15_ITEM7_P173_S0	Our critical accounting policies are as follows:
24090_15_ITEM7_P174_S0	Future policy benefit reserves have been computed by the net level premium method with assumptions as to investment yields, dividends on participating business, mortality and withdrawals based upon our experience.
24090_15_ITEM7_P174_S1	The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of policy liabilities and the increase in future policy benefit reserves.
24090_15_ITEM7_P174_S2	Management's judgments and estimates for future policy benefit reserves provide for possible unfavorable deviation.
24090_15_ITEM7_P175_S0	We continue to use the original assumptions (including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation) in subsequent periods to determine the changes in the liability for future policy benefits (the "lock-in concept ) unless a premium deficiency exists.
24090_15_ITEM7_P175_S1	Management monitors these assumptions and has determined that a premium deficiency did not exist as of December 31, 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM7_P175_S2	Management believes that our policy liabilities and increase in future policy benefit reserves as of the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 are based upon assumptions, including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation, that do not warrant revision.
24090_15_ITEM7_P176_S0	Acquisition costs, consisting of commissions and policy issuance, underwriting and agency expenses that relate to and vary with the successful production of new business, are deferred.
24090_15_ITEM7_P176_S1	These deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized primarily over the estimated profits, using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_15_ITEM7_P177_S0	We utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance.
24090_15_ITEM7_P177_S1	The factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period.
24090_15_ITEM7_P177_S2	The factor method ensures that policies which lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation.
24090_15_ITEM7_P177_S3	The factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value, provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors.
24090_15_ITEM7_P178_S0	Inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred, the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_15_ITEM7_P178_S1	Approximately 93.0% of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year excess commissions.
24090_15_ITEM7_P178_S2	The remaining 7.0% are attributed to costs that vary with and are directly related to the successful acquisition of new insurance business.
24090_15_ITEM7_P178_S3	Those costs generally include costs related to the production, underwriting and issuance of new business.
24090_15_ITEM7_P179_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_15_ITEM7_P179_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 30 years.
24090_15_ITEM7_P179_S2	The available premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated.
24090_15_ITEM7_P179_S3	The deferred policy acquisition costs are then evaluated over two methods utilizing reasonable assumptions and two other methods using pessimistic assumptions.
24090_15_ITEM7_P179_S4	The two methods using reasonable assumptions illustrate an early-deferred policy acquisition recoverability period.
24090_15_ITEM7_P179_S5	The two methods utilizing pessimistic assumptions still support early recoverability of our aggregate deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_15_ITEM7_P180_S0	Management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value.
24090_15_ITEM7_P180_S1	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on capitalized expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business, utilization of the factor method and annual recoverability testing.
24090_15_ITEM7_P181_S0	Cost of Customer Relationships Acquired ("CCRA") is established when we purchase a block of insurance.
24090_15_ITEM7_P181_S1	CCRA is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_15_ITEM7_P182_S0	We utilize various methods to determine the amount of the ending asset balance, including a static model and a dynamic model.
24090_15_ITEM7_P182_S1	Inherent in the amortization of CCRA are certain management judgments about the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_15_ITEM7_P182_S2	The assumptions used are based upon interest, mortality and lapses at the time of purchase.
24090_15_ITEM7_P183_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_15_ITEM7_P183_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next thirty years.
24090_15_ITEM7_P183_S2	The CCRA is then evaluated utilizing reasonable assumptions.
24090_15_ITEM7_P183_S3	Management believes our CCRA and related amortization is recoverable for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
24090_15_ITEM7_P183_S4	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on estimated future results of the block and our annual recoverability testing.
24090_15_ITEM7_P184_S0	Current accounting guidance requires that goodwill balances be reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event has occurred.
24090_15_ITEM7_P185_S0	A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment on one level below an operating segment.
24090_15_ITEM7_P185_S1	Most of the Company's reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated, are equivalent to the Company's operating segment, as there is no discrete financial information available for the separate components of the segment or all of the components of the segment have similar economic characteristics.
24090_15_ITEM7_P186_S0	The goodwill impairment test follows a multi-step process as defined under current accounting guidance.
24090_15_ITEM7_P186_S1	An initial review may be performed whereby the assessment is based upon a qualitative factors before performing the first test step.
24090_15_ITEM7_P187_S0	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
24090_15_ITEM7_P187_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment.
24090_15_ITEM7_P187_S2	In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value.
24090_15_ITEM7_P188_S0	carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
24090_15_ITEM7_P189_S0	Management's determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations, peer company price to earnings multiples, the level of the Company's Class A common stock price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit.
24090_15_ITEM7_P189_S1	Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections.
24090_15_ITEM7_P190_S0	The evaluation of securities for impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings.
24090_15_ITEM7_P190_S1	The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition or future prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period.
24090_15_ITEM7_P191_S0	Based upon current accounting guidance, investment securities must be classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading.
24090_15_ITEM7_P191_S1	Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase.
24090_15_ITEM7_P192_S0	The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities.
24090_15_ITEM7_P192_S1	Fixed maturity securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the Company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity.
24090_15_ITEM7_P192_S2	Securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings until realized.
24090_15_ITEM7_P193_S0	The Company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if an OTTI exists pursuant to the accounting guidelines.
24090_15_ITEM7_P193_S1	In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the ability and intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
24090_15_ITEM7_P193_S2	In analyzing an issuer's financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the Federal government or its agencies, by government-sponsored agencies, or whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and reviews of the issuer's financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM7_P194_S0	If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, management must then determine the amount of OTTI to be recognized in earnings.
24090_15_ITEM7_P194_S1	If management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.
24090_15_ITEM7_P194_S2	The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.
24090_15_ITEM7_P194_S3	The amount of OTTI related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_15_ITEM7_P194_S4	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_15_ITEM7_P194_S5	If management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_15_ITEM7_P194_S6	Any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain (as other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold.
24090_15_ITEM7_P195_S0	The Company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions, future market movements, business plan changes, or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time.
24090_15_ITEM7_P196_S0	Premiums on life and accident and health policies are reported as earned when due or, for short duration contracts, over the contract period on a pro rata basis.
24090_15_ITEM7_P196_S1	Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in recognition of profits over the estimated life of the contracts.
24090_15_ITEM7_P196_S2	This matching is accomplished by means of provisions for future benefits and the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_15_ITEM7_P197_S0	Annuities are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest bearing financial instruments.
24090_15_ITEM7_P198_S0	Our primary annuity products do not include fees or other such charges.
24090_15_ITEM7_P199_S0	A deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recorded only if a determination is made that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax treatment on which the deferred tax item depends will be sustained in the event of an audit.
24090_15_ITEM7_P199_S1	These determinations inherently involve management's judgment.
24090_15_ITEM7_P199_S2	In addition, the Company must record a tax valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
24090_15_ITEM7_P199_S3	This valuation allowance is in essence a contra account to the deferred tax asset.
24090_15_ITEM7_P199_S4	Management must determine the portion of the deferred tax asset and resulting tax benefit that may not be realized based upon judgment of expected outcomes.
24090_15_ITEM7_P200_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_15_ITEM7_P200_S1	Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position.
24090_15_ITEM7_P201_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The nature of our business exposes us to market risk relative to our invested assets and policy liabilities.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Market risk is the risk of loss that may occur when changes in interest rates and public equity prices adversely affect the value of our invested assets.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Interest rate risk is our primary market risk exposure.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can affect the fair value of our investments.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio generally increases when interest rates decrease and decreases when interest rates increase.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The following table summarizes net unrealized gains and losses as of the dates indicated.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our exposure to interest rate changes results from our significant holdings of fixed maturity investments, policy loans and mortgage loans on real estate, all of which comprised over 88.4% of our cash and investment portfolio as of December 31, 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	These investments are mainly exposed to changes in U.S. Treasury rates.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Our fixed maturities investments include U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, U.S. Government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, state and municipal bonds, and corporate bonds.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Approximately 66.2% of the fixed maturities we owned at market value on December 31, 2014 are state and political subdivisions which are primarily municipal holdings.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P2_S4	These holdings are diversified over several states.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	To manage interest risk, we perform periodic projections of asset and liability cash flows to evaluate the potential sensitivity of our investments and liabilities.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We assess interest rate sensitivity on an annual basis with respect to our fixed maturities investments using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward shifts in the prevailing interest rates.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The Company performed an analysis of fair value changes using assumed 100 basis point upward shifts in interest rates, noting that the fair value of our fixed maturity investment portfolio of $940.1 million would decrease approximately $60.6 million to a fair value of $879.5 million upon a 100 basis point increase.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The following table shows the effects on the fair values of our fixed maturity investments based upon these scenarios.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	While the test scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed-income markets, it is a near-term change that illustrates the potential impact of such events.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Due to the composition of our book of insurance business, we believe it is unlikely we would encounter large surrender activity due to an interest rate increase that would force us to dispose of our fixed maturities at a loss.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Our fixed maturity portfolio is exposed to call risk as a significant portion of the current holdings are callable.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P7_S1	A decreasing interest rate environment can result in increased call activity as experienced over the past several years, and an increasing rate environment will likely result in securities being paid at their stated maturity.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	There are no fixed maturities or other investments that we classify as trading instruments.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Approximately 75.2% of fixed maturities were held in available-for-sale and 24.8% in held-to-maturity based upon fair value at December 31, 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM7A_P8_S2	At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had no investments in derivative instruments, subprime loans or CDOs (collateralized debt obligations).
24090_15_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Changes in the level or volatility of equity prices affect the value of equity securities we hold as investments.
24090_15_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Our equity investments portfolio represented 6.6% of our total investments at December 31, 2014 , with 97.1% % invested in diversified equity and bond mutual funds.
24090_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	Reference is made to the financial statements, the notes thereto, and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm, as listed on the table of contents.
24090_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	All other schedules have been omitted as the required information is inapplicable or the information required is presented in the financial statements or the notes thereto filed elsewhere herein.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure, among other things, material information relating to our Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to our officers who certify our financial reports and to the other members of our senior management and the Board of Directors.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and our Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") are responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")).
24090_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based upon an evaluation at the end of the period, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management of our Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Management assessed internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 Framework("COSO").
24090_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on this assessment, management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 was not effective due to a material weakness in our control environment related to key employee competency as described below.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	We became aware of an ineffective executive management review control as it pertains to our actuarial function that was relied upon by management.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	As part of an internal operation review of the life insurance products issued by our subsidiary insurance companies, the Company s management determined during the first quarter of 2015 that a substantial portion of its endowment policies and whole life insurance policies do not qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702 and 7702A of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") of 1986.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P4_S1	The policies at issue were primarily sold to non-U.S. citizens residing abroad.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P4_S2	As a result, we have estimated that the failure of these policies to qualify under the IRC sections above could result in additional expenses of $11.4 million to $40.0 million net of tax, related to projected toll charges and fees as well as increased claims liability for past claims and reserves increases to bring policies into compliance.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P4_S3	Due to the nature of this failure we believe this is an entity level control failure related to personnel competency and a lack of the appropriate sensitivity and precision in executive management s review of the actuarial function.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P4_S4	Therefore, management assesses that there was a reasonable possibility that the Company's annual or quarterly financial statements could have contained a material misstatement that would not have been detected.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Management has begun to remediate this material weakness by removing the Company s Chief Actuary and obtaining additional actuarial resources with appropriate expertise.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Management also intends to initiate an enhanced risk assessment program to mitigate this type of risk in the future, including, but not limited to, more robust internal controls directly related to the review of all aspects of the actuarial process.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P6_S1	The report is included in item 9A(d) of this annual report.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P7_S0	During 2014 , there have been no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that materially affect or are reasonably likely to affect the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P8_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Citizens, Inc.:
24090_15_ITEM9A_P9_S0	We have audited Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
24090_15_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting .
24090_15_ITEM9A_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P10_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
24090_15_ITEM9A_P10_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P10_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P10_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P11_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P11_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P12_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P13_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P13_S1	The following material weakness has been identified and included in management s assessment.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P14_S0	Management has identified a material weakness in the executive management review control as it pertains to the actuarial function that was relied upon by management.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P14_S1	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P14_S2	This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2014 financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated April 6, 2015, which expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
24090_15_ITEM9A_P15_S0	In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the COSO criteria.
24090_15_ITEM9B_P0_S0	Items 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of this Report incorporate by reference the information in our definitive proxy material under the headings "Election of Directors and Executive Officers," "Executive Officer and Director Compensation," "Stock and Principal Stockholders," "Control of the Company," and "Principal Accounting Fees and Services," to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 120 days after December 31, 2014 .

24090_15_ITEM15_P3_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.
24090_15_ITEM15_P4_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
24090_15_ITEM15_P4_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
24090_15_ITEM15_P5_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
24090_15_ITEM15_P5_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
24090_15_ITEM15_P5_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
24090_15_ITEM15_P6_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
24090_15_ITEM15_P6_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
24090_15_ITEM15_P7_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 Framework and our report dated April 6, 2015 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.

24090_15_ITEM15_P15_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
24090_15_ITEM15_P16_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Citizens, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP").
24090_15_ITEM15_P17_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of Citizens, Inc.

("CTI"), and Insurance Investors, Inc. ("III").
24090_15_ITEM15_P17_S1	All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
24090_15_ITEM15_P18_S0	In accordance with our purchase agreement dated October 7, 2013, we finalized the MGLIC stock acquisition on March 7, 2014 for approximately $5.2 million in cash consideration.
24090_15_ITEM15_P18_S1	The assets recorded as of acquisition were $12.0 million , liabilities of $ 6.8 million and stockholders equity of $5.2 million .
24090_15_ITEM15_P18_S2	We recorded goodwill of $0.1 million related to this purchase.
24090_15_ITEM15_P18_S3	This entity is reported as part of our home service segment and is a wholly owned subsidiary of SPLIC.
24090_15_ITEM15_P19_S0	We provide primarily life insurance and endowments, as well as a small amount of health insurance policies, through four of our subsidiaries - CICA, SPLIC, MGLIC, and CNLIC.
24090_15_ITEM15_P19_S1	CICA and CNLIC issue ordinary whole-life policies, burial insurance, pre-need policies, and accident and health related policies throughout the Midwest and southern United States.
24090_15_ITEM15_P19_S2	CICA also issues ordinary whole-life and endowment policies to non-U.S. residents.
24090_15_ITEM15_P20_S0	SPLIC and MGLIC offer final expense and industrial life insurance in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, and SPFIC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SPLIC, writes a limited amount of property insurance in Louisiana.
24090_15_ITEM15_P21_S0	CTI provides data processing systems and services, as well as furniture and equipment, to the Company.
24090_15_ITEM15_P22_S0	III provides aviation transportation to the Company.
24090_15_ITEM15_P23_S0	Investment securities are classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading.
24090_15_ITEM15_P23_S1	Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase.
24090_15_ITEM15_P24_S0	The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities.
24090_15_ITEM15_P24_S1	Fixed maturity securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the Company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity.
24090_15_ITEM15_P24_S2	Securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings until realized.
24090_15_ITEM15_P25_S0	Fixed maturities consist primarily of bonds classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.
24090_15_ITEM15_P25_S1	The Company does not classify any fixed maturities as trading.
24090_15_ITEM15_P25_S2	Equity securities (including non-redeemable preferred stock) are considered available-for-sale and are reported at fair value.
24090_15_ITEM15_P26_S0	Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of equity securities and fixed maturities held as available-for-sale is shown as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of tax, and is a separate component of comprehensive income.
24090_15_ITEM15_P27_S0	The Company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if an other-than-temporary impairment ("OTTI") exists pursuant to the accounting guidelines.
24090_15_ITEM15_P27_S1	In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the ability and intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
24090_15_ITEM15_P27_S2	In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the Federal government or its agencies, by government-sponsored agencies, or whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and reviews of the issuer s financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM15_P28_S0	If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, management must then determine the amount of OTTI to be recognized in earnings.
24090_15_ITEM15_P28_S1	If management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.
24090_15_ITEM15_P28_S2	The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.
24090_15_ITEM15_P28_S3	The amount of OTTI related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_15_ITEM15_P28_S4	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_15_ITEM15_P28_S5	If management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_15_ITEM15_P28_S6	Any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain (as other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold.
24090_15_ITEM15_P29_S0	The Company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions, future market movements, business plan changes, or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time.
24090_15_ITEM15_P30_S0	Mortgage loans on real estate and policy loans are reported at unpaid principal balances.
24090_15_ITEM15_P31_S0	Real estate and other long-term investments consist primarily of land and buildings that are recorded at depreciated cost.
24090_15_ITEM15_P31_S1	If the fair value of the real estate is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized and charged to earnings.
24090_15_ITEM15_P32_S0	Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method.
24090_15_ITEM15_P33_S0	Dividend and interest income is recognized when earned.
24090_15_ITEM15_P33_S1	Realized gains and losses are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold.
24090_15_ITEM15_P34_S0	The Company had cash equivalents and fixed maturities with an aggregate fair value of $10.3 million and $9.3 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, on deposit with various state regulatory authorities to fulfill statutory requirements.
24090_15_ITEM15_P35_S0	Premiums on life policies are recognized as earned when due.
24090_15_ITEM15_P35_S1	Due premiums on the balance sheet are net of allowances.
24090_15_ITEM15_P36_S0	Accident and health policies are recognized as revenue over the contract period on a pro rata basis.
24090_15_ITEM15_P36_S1	Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in the recognition of profits over the estimated lives of the contracts.
24090_15_ITEM15_P36_S2	This matching is accomplished by means of a provision for future policy benefits and the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	Annuity policies, primarily flexible premium fixed annuity products, are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest bearing financial instruments.
24090_15_ITEM15_P37_S1	Premium receipts are not reported as revenue, rather as deposit liabilities to annuity contracts.
24090_15_ITEM15_P37_S2	The annuity products issued do not include fees or other such charges.
24090_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	Acquisition costs, consisting of commissions and policy issuance, underwriting and agent convention expenses that are primarily related to and vary with the successful production of new and renewal business, have been deferred.
24090_15_ITEM15_P38_S1	These deferred amounts, referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC"), are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and amortized to income in a systematic manner, based on related contract revenues or gross profits as appropriate.
24090_15_ITEM15_P39_S0	Traditional life insurance and accident and health insurance acquisition costs are being amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing future policy benefit liabilities.
24090_15_ITEM15_P39_S1	For universal life type contracts and investment contracts that include significant surrender charges or that yield significant revenues from sources other than the investment contract holders' funds, the deferred contract acquisition cost amortization is matched to the recognition of gross profit.
24090_15_ITEM15_P39_S2	The effect on the DAC asset that would result from realization of unrealized gains or losses is recognized with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income in consolidated stockholders' equity.
24090_15_ITEM15_P40_S0	substantially changes a contract as defined in current accounting guidance, then the DAC is written off immediately through income and any new deferrable costs associated with the new replacement are deferred.
24090_15_ITEM15_P40_S1	If a contract modification does not substantially change the contract, the DAC amortization on the original contract will continue and any acquisition costs associated with the related modification are immediately expensed.
24090_15_ITEM15_P41_S0	We utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance.
24090_15_ITEM15_P41_S1	The factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period.
24090_15_ITEM15_P41_S2	The factor method ensures that policies lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation.
24090_15_ITEM15_P41_S3	The factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value, provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors.
24090_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	Inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred, the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_15_ITEM15_P42_S1	Approximately 93% of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year and renewal excess commissions.
24090_15_ITEM15_P42_S2	The remaining 7% are attributed to costs that vary with and are directly related to the successful acquisition of new insurance business.
24090_15_ITEM15_P42_S3	Those costs generally include costs related to the production, underwriting and issuance of new business.
24090_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_15_ITEM15_P43_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less the benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 30 years.
24090_15_ITEM15_P43_S2	The available premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated.
24090_15_ITEM15_P43_S3	The deferred policy acquisition costs are then evaluated over two methods utilizing reasonable assumptions and two other methods using pessimistic assumptions.
24090_15_ITEM15_P43_S4	Management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value.
24090_15_ITEM15_P43_S5	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on capitalized expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business, utilization of the factor method and annual recoverability testing.
24090_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	The components of deferred acquisition costs from year to year are summarized as follows:
24090_15_ITEM15_P45_S0	Cost of customer relationships acquired ("CCRA") is established when we purchase a block of insurance.
24090_15_ITEM15_P45_S1	CCRA is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_15_ITEM15_P46_S0	We utilize various methods to determine the amount of the ending asset balance, including a static model and a dynamic model.
24090_15_ITEM15_P46_S1	Inherent in the amortization of CCRA are certain management judgments about the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_15_ITEM15_P46_S2	The assumptions used are based upon interest, mortality and lapses at the time of purchase.
24090_15_ITEM15_P47_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_15_ITEM15_P47_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less the benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next thirty years.
24090_15_ITEM15_P47_S2	The CCRA is then evaluated utilizing reasonable assumptions.
24090_15_ITEM15_P47_S3	Management believes that our CCRA and related amortization is recoverable for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
24090_15_ITEM15_P47_S4	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on estimated future results of the block and our annual recoverability testing.
24090_15_ITEM15_P48_S0	Cost of customer relationships acquired relative to purchased blocks of insurance is summarized as follows:
24090_15_ITEM15_P49_S0	Estimated amortization of cost of customer relationship acquired in each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows.
24090_15_ITEM15_P49_S1	Actual future amortization will differ from these estimates due to variances from estimated future withdrawal assumptions.
24090_15_ITEM15_P50_S0	The value of CCRA in our various acquisitions, which is included in cost of customer relationships acquired in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, was determined based on the present value of future profits discounted at annual rates ranging from 3.7% to 8.5% .
24090_15_ITEM15_P51_S0	Future policy benefit reserves for traditional life insurance and accident and health insurance contract benefits and expenses are computed using a net level premium method, with assumptions as to investment yields, dividends on participating business, mortality and withdrawals based upon our experience, modified as necessary to reflect anticipated trends and to include provisions for possible unfavorable deviations.
24090_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	The accrued account balance for non-traditional life insurance and investment contracts is computed as deposits net of withdrawals made by the contract holder, plus amounts credited based on contract specifications, less contract fees and charges assessed, plus any additional interest.
24090_15_ITEM15_P52_S1	Annuity interest crediting rates range from 3.0% to 5.5% annually.
24090_15_ITEM15_P52_S2	Benefits and expenses are charged against the account balance to recognize costs as incurred over the estimated lives of the contracts.
24090_15_ITEM15_P52_S3	Expenses include interest credited to contract account balances and benefits paid in excess of contract account balances.
24090_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	Unpaid claims on accident and health policies represent the estimated liability for benefit expenses, both reported but not paid and incurred but not reported to the Company.
24090_15_ITEM15_P53_S1	Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated using individual case basis valuations and statistical analyzes.
24090_15_ITEM15_P53_S2	Those estimates are subject to the effects of trends in claim severity and frequency.
24090_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	Anticipated investment income is not considered in determining whether a premium deficiency exists with respect to short-duration contracts.
24090_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	Premium deposits accrue interest at rates ranging from 4.0% to 8.25% per annum.
24090_15_ITEM15_P55_S1	The cost of insurance is included in the premium when collected and interest is credited annually to deposit accounts.
24090_15_ITEM15_P56_S0	The development of liabilities for future policy benefits requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding mortality, morbidity, lapse, expense, and investment experience.
24090_15_ITEM15_P56_S1	These estimates are based primarily on historical experience and future expectations of mortality, morbidity, expense, persistency, and investment assumptions.
24090_15_ITEM15_P56_S2	Actual results could differ materially from estimates.
24090_15_ITEM15_P56_S3	We monitor actual experience and revise assumptions as necessary.
24090_15_ITEM15_P57_S0	Goodwill is the difference between the purchase price in a business combination and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, and is not amortized.
24090_15_ITEM15_P57_S1	Other intangible assets include various state insurance licenses, which have been determined to have indefinite useful lives and, therefore, are not amortized.
24090_15_ITEM15_P57_S2	Both goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are subject to annual impairment analyzes.
24090_15_ITEM15_P58_S0	The goodwill impairment test uses a two-step process as set forth under current accounting guidance.
24090_15_ITEM15_P58_S1	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
24090_15_ITEM15_P58_S2	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment.
24090_15_ITEM15_P58_S3	In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value.
24090_15_ITEM15_P58_S4	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
24090_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	Management's determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations, peer company price to earnings multiples, the level of the Company's Class A common stock price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit.
24090_15_ITEM15_P59_S1	Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections.
24090_15_ITEM15_P60_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company had goodwill of $12.6 million allocated to the Life Insurance segment and $4.6 million allocated to the Home Service Insurance segment.
24090_15_ITEM15_P60_S1	The Company completes its annual goodwill assessment for the individual reporting units within the Life Insurance segment and Home Service Insurance segment as of December 31 each year.
24090_15_ITEM15_P60_S2	There was no impairment of goodwill in 2014 , 2013 or 2012 .
24090_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , participating business approximated 60.7% of direct life insurance in force.
24090_15_ITEM15_P62_S0	Future policy benefits on participating policies are estimated based on net level premium reserves for death and endowment policy benefits with interest rates ranging from 3% to 8% , and the cash surrender values described in such contracts.
24090_15_ITEM15_P62_S1	The scaling rate used for the 2014 portfolio ranged between 3.7% for 2 years and then going up to 5% over 15 years and remaining there for the duration.
24090_15_ITEM15_P63_S0	Earnings and dividends on participating policies are allocated based on policies in force.
24090_15_ITEM15_P64_S0	Policyholder dividends are determined based on the discretion of the Board of Directors of the policy issuing subsidiary.
24090_15_ITEM15_P64_S1	Policyholder dividends are accrued over the premium paying periods of the insurance contract.
24090_15_ITEM15_P65_S0	Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.
24090_15_ITEM15_P65_S1	Diluted earnings per share are computed under the if-converted method for convertible securities and the treasury stock method for warrants, giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock, including options, warrants and convertible/redeemable preferred stock.
24090_15_ITEM15_P65_S2	The basic and diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock are one half the earnings per share of the Class A common stock.
24090_15_ITEM15_P66_S0	During 2012, the warrants associated with the Series A-2 Preferred Stock were either exercised or expired.
24090_15_ITEM15_P66_S1	Shares issued from the exercise of warrants totaled 113,057 and 13,606 common Class A shares were issued under a cashless provision in the Preferred Stock contract.
24090_15_ITEM15_P67_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
24090_15_ITEM15_P68_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
24090_15_ITEM15_P68_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered.
24090_15_ITEM15_P69_S0	A deferred tax asset is recorded only if a determination is made that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax treatment on which the deferred tax asset depends will be sustained in the event of an audit.
24090_15_ITEM15_P69_S1	These determinations inherently involve management's judgment.
24090_15_ITEM15_P69_S2	In addition, the Company must record a tax valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
24090_15_ITEM15_P69_S3	This valuation allowance is in essence a contra account to the deferred tax asset.
24090_15_ITEM15_P69_S4	Management must determine the portion of the deferred tax asset and resulting tax benefit that may not be realized based upon judgment of expected outcomes.
24090_15_ITEM15_P70_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_15_ITEM15_P70_S1	Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position.
24090_15_ITEM15_P71_S0	Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
24090_15_ITEM15_P71_S1	Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to thirty years.
24090_15_ITEM15_P72_S0	We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated life of the improvements.
24090_15_ITEM15_P72_S1	The Company has no capital leases.
24090_15_ITEM15_P73_S0	The following is a summary of property and equipment.
24090_15_ITEM15_P74_S0	Reinsurance recoverable includes expected reimbursements for policyholder claim amounts in excess of the Company's retention, as well as profit sharing and experience refund accruals.
24090_15_ITEM15_P74_S1	Reinsurance recoverable is reduced for estimated uncollectible amounts, if any.
24090_15_ITEM15_P75_S0	Reinsurance premiums, losses and adjustment expenses are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts.
24090_15_ITEM15_P75_S1	The cost of reinsurance related to long duration contracts is accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies.
24090_15_ITEM15_P75_S2	The cost of reinsurance related to short duration contracts is accounted for over the coverage period.
24090_15_ITEM15_P75_S3	Profit-sharing and similar adjustable provisions are accrued based on the experience of the underlying policies.
24090_15_ITEM15_P76_S0	The Company considers as cash equivalents all securities whose duration does not exceed 90 days at the date of acquisition.
24090_15_ITEM15_P77_S0	The Company considers investments maturing within one year at acquisition as short-term.
24090_15_ITEM15_P77_S1	These securities are carried at amortized cost, which approximates market value.
24090_15_ITEM15_P78_S0	Depreciation on most property and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis using estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years.
24090_15_ITEM15_P78_S1	Building improvements are depreciated over the estimated lives of thirty years.
24090_15_ITEM15_P79_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
24090_15_ITEM15_P79_S1	Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
24090_15_ITEM15_P80_S0	Certain amounts presented in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
24090_15_ITEM15_P81_S0	On January 1, 2014, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) ASU 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists to eliminate diversity in practice.
24090_15_ITEM15_P81_S1	This ASU requires that companies net their unrecognized tax benefits against all same-jurisdiction net operating losses or tax credit carryforwards that would be used to settle the position with a tax authority.
24090_15_ITEM15_P81_S2	The adoption of this ASU did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.
24090_15_ITEM15_P82_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.
24090_15_ITEM15_P82_S1	The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
24090_15_ITEM15_P82_S2	The guidance provides a five-step process to achieve that core principle.
24090_15_ITEM15_P83_S0	ASU 2014-09 requires disclosures enabling users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
24090_15_ITEM15_P83_S1	Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.
24090_15_ITEM15_P84_S0	ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, using one of two retrospective application methods.
24090_15_ITEM15_P84_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this ASU will have on its financial statements.
24090_15_ITEM15_P85_S0	The Affordable Care Act, was passed by the U.S. Congress in 2010.
24090_15_ITEM15_P85_S1	The Company has considered its medical and dental plans provided for employees and agents.
24090_15_ITEM15_P85_S2	While the Company will incur additional costs associated with the implementation of this Act, it does not believe these costs or ongoing costs associated with this Act will have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.
24090_15_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Company does not provide a separate prescription drug plan to its retirees.
24090_15_ITEM15_P86_S1	In addition, the Company does not sell any medical insurance or prescription drug coverage.
24090_15_ITEM15_P86_S2	The Company will continue to assess the information contained in this Act as additional guidance becomes available and as additional implications are understood or clarified.
24090_15_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( the Financial Reform Act ) includes a provision to establish a Federal Insurance Office with the primary purpose of collecting information to better understand insurance issues at the federal level and to monitor the extent to which traditional underserved communities and consumers, minorities and low and moderate income persons have access to affordable insurance products.
24090_15_ITEM15_P87_S1	The Financial Reform Act also contains provisions affecting financial institutions, credit rating agencies and other commercial and consumer businesses.
24090_15_ITEM15_P88_S0	The Company invests primarily in fixed maturity securities, which totaled 83.6% of total investments and cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM15_P88_S1	Holdings in high quality fixed maturity securities rated A or higher by Standard Poor's, Inc. totaled 81.4% of investment holdings in this category, reflecting the conservative investment philosophy of the Company.
24090_15_ITEM15_P89_S0	The cost, gross unrealized gains and losses and fair value of investments in fixed maturities and equity securities, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , are as follows.
24090_15_ITEM15_P90_S0	For investments of available-for-sale fixed maturities that have unrealized losses as of December 31, 2014 , the cost, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer and fair value are as follows.
24090_15_ITEM15_P91_S0	The available-for-sale fixed maturities in a gross unrealized loss position for more than 12 months is primarily related to rises in interest rates which results in lower market prices on fixed maturity securities that have lower coupons than the current market rate.
24090_15_ITEM15_P91_S1	This is interest rate risk and is not a signal of impairment.
24090_15_ITEM15_P91_S2	Management has completed its assessment of other-than-temporary impairment of these securities.
24090_15_ITEM15_P91_S3	Based on our evaluation of the credit worthiness of the issuers and because we do not intend to sell the investments, nor is it likely that we would be required to sell these investments, before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, none of the unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporary.
24090_15_ITEM15_P92_S0	We monitor all debt and equity securities on an on-going basis relative to changes in credit ratings, market prices, earnings trends and financial performance, in addition to specific region or industry reviews.
24090_15_ITEM15_P92_S1	Our impairment review, in accordance with current guidance, is performed by the Company at each reporting date and management uses its best judgment to decide if impairment is other-than-temporary.
24090_15_ITEM15_P92_S2	We determine other-than-temporary impairment by reviewing relevant evidence related to the specific security issuer, as well as our intent to sell the security or whether we more likely than not will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery.
24090_15_ITEM15_P93_S0	All securities with a market price below par were segregated and reviewed as of December 31, 2014 based upon the items above for impairment.
24090_15_ITEM15_P94_S0	For investments of available-for-sale fixed maturities and equity securities that have unrealized losses as of December 31, 2013 , the cost, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer and fair value are as follows.
24090_15_ITEM15_P95_S0	The amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturities at December 31, 2014 by contractual maturity are shown below.
24090_15_ITEM15_P96_S0	Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
24090_15_ITEM15_P97_S0	Securities not due at a single maturity date have been reflected based upon the final stated maturity.
24090_15_ITEM15_P98_S0	The Company had no investments in any one entity which exceeded 10% of stockholders' equity at December 31, 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM15_P98_S1	In addition, there were no investments that were non-income producing for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM15_P99_S0	Major categories of net investment income are summarized as follows:
24090_15_ITEM15_P100_S0	Proceeds and gross realized gains and losses from sales of fixed maturities available-for-sale for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 are summarized as follows:
24090_15_ITEM15_P101_S0	In 2014 , two bonds were sold for a gain related to the non-insurance subsidiaries holdings.
24090_15_ITEM15_P101_S1	Certain securities were sold during 2012 from a tax planning perspective and due to statutory reporting considerations related to non-rated securities.
24090_15_ITEM15_P101_S2	There were no securities sold from the held-to-maturity portfolio in 2014 , 2013 or 2012 .
24090_15_ITEM15_P102_S0	Proceeds and gross realized gains and losses from sales of equity securities for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 are summarized as follows:
24090_15_ITEM15_P103_S0	In 2014 , the Company sold three equity and bond mutual funds that resulted in a net loss of $51,000 due to circumstances that arose based upon the current environment and due to the fact that they were shorter duration funds.
24090_15_ITEM15_P103_S1	In 2013 two equity mutual funds were sold resulting in a net loss of $0.4 million for tax planning considerations.
24090_15_ITEM15_P103_S2	During 2012 , the Company sold holdings of equity mutual funds that were previously impaired, generating realized capital gains for financial reporting purposes of $0.6 million , but realized losses for tax purposes.
24090_15_ITEM15_P103_S3	The tax losses offset current year tax gains and were carried back to recover taxes paid on gains in prior years.
24090_15_ITEM15_P104_S0	Realized investment gains (losses) are as follows:
24090_15_ITEM15_P105_S0	We recorded an OTTI write-down in 2014 of $0.4 million related to two equity bond mutual funds as we no longer have the intent to hold these shorter duration issues until recovery.
24090_15_ITEM15_P105_S1	We also recorded impairments in 2012 of $1.3 million related to a bond issuer that declared bankruptcy in 2011.
24090_15_ITEM15_P106_S0	The Company had realized gains of $525 from calls of held-to-maturity fixed maturities in 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM15_P107_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
24090_15_ITEM15_P107_S1	We hold fixed maturity and equity securities that are carried at fair value.
24090_15_ITEM15_P108_S0	Fair value measurements are generally based upon observable and unobservable inputs.
24090_15_ITEM15_P108_S1	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.
24090_15_ITEM15_P108_S2	We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
24090_15_ITEM15_P109_S0	All assets and liabilities carried at fair value are required to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
24090_15_ITEM15_P110_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
24090_15_ITEM15_P111_S0	Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose inputs or whose significant value drivers are observable.
24090_15_ITEM15_P112_S0	Level 3 - Instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable.
24090_15_ITEM15_P113_S0	Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as U.S. Treasury securities, publicly traded mutual fund investments and individual stocks.
24090_15_ITEM15_P114_S0	Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued by independent pricing services or broker quotes.
24090_15_ITEM15_P114_S1	These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various inputs, such as interest rates, credit spreads and foreign exchange rates for the underlying financial instruments.
24090_15_ITEM15_P115_S0	Financial instruments in this category primarily include corporate fixed maturity securities, U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise securities, municipal securities and certain mortgage and asset-backed securities.
24090_15_ITEM15_P116_S0	Level 3 is comprised of financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on non-binding broker prices utilizing significant inputs not based on, or corroborated by, readily available market information.
24090_15_ITEM15_P116_S1	This category consists of two private placement mortgage-backed securities where we cannot corroborate the significant valuation inputs with market observable data.
24090_15_ITEM15_P117_S0	The following table sets forth our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the date indicated.
24090_15_ITEM15_P118_S0	At December 31, 2014 , the fixed maturities, valued using a third-party pricing source, totaled $694.0 million for Level 2 assets and comprised 89.3% of total reported fair value.
24090_15_ITEM15_P118_S1	Fair values for Level 3 assets are based upon unadjusted broker quotes that are non-binding.
24090_15_ITEM15_P119_S0	The Level 1 and Level 2 valuations are reviewed and validated quarterly through random testing by comparisons to separate pricing models, other third party pricing services, and back tested to recent trades.
24090_15_ITEM15_P119_S1	In addition, we obtain information relative to the third party pricing models and review model parameters for reasonableness.
24090_15_ITEM15_P119_S2	For the period ended December 31, 2014 , there were no material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine fair values, and no broker or third party prices were changed from the values received.
24090_15_ITEM15_P120_S0	There were no transfers made between level 1 and 2 securities at December 31, 2014 or 2013 .
24090_15_ITEM15_P121_S0	Fair values of these securities are based upon quoted market price and are classified as Level 1 assets.
24090_15_ITEM15_P122_S0	The following table presents additional information about fixed maturity securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and for which we have utilized significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs to determine fair value:
24090_15_ITEM15_P123_S0	We review the fair value hierarchy classifications each reporting period.
24090_15_ITEM15_P124_S0	Changes in the observability of the valuation attributes may result in a reclassification of certain financial assets.
24090_15_ITEM15_P124_S1	Such reclassifications, if any, are reported as transfers in and out of Level 3 at the beginning fair value for the reporting period in which the changes occur.
24090_15_ITEM15_P125_S0	Estimates of fair values are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market prices and information about the financial instrument.
24090_15_ITEM15_P125_S1	The estimated fair values of financial instruments presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company might realize in actual market transactions.
24090_15_ITEM15_P125_S2	The carrying amount and fair value for the financial assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at each year-end were as follows:
24090_15_ITEM15_P126_S0	Fair values for fixed income securities, which are characterized as Level 2 assets in the fair value hierarchy, are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar securities.
24090_15_ITEM15_P126_S1	In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other assumptions, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.
24090_15_ITEM15_P127_S0	Mortgage loans are secured principally by residential properties and commercial properties.
24090_15_ITEM15_P127_S1	Weighted average interest rates for these loans were approximately 6.3% and 6.4% per year, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, with maturities ranging from 2 to 29 years.
24090_15_ITEM15_P127_S2	Management estimated the fair value using an annual interest rate of 6.25% at December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
24090_15_ITEM15_P127_S3	Our mortgage loans are considered Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_15_ITEM15_P128_S0	Policy loans have a weighted average annual interest rate of 7.7% as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and have no specified maturity dates.
24090_15_ITEM15_P129_S0	These loans typically carry an interest rate that is tied to the crediting rate applied to the related policy and contract reserves.
24090_15_ITEM15_P130_S0	Policy loans are an integral part of the life insurance policies that we have in force and cannot be valued separately and are not marketable.
24090_15_ITEM15_P130_S1	Therefore, the fair value approximates the carrying value and policy loans are considered Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_15_ITEM15_P131_S0	The fair value of short-term investments approximate carrying value due to their short-term nature.
24090_15_ITEM15_P131_S1	Our short-term investments are considered Level 2 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_15_ITEM15_P132_S0	The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximate carrying value and are characterized as Level 1 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_15_ITEM15_P133_S0	The fair value of the Company's liabilities under annuity contract policies, which are considered Level 3 assets, was estimated at December 31, 2014 using discounted cash flows based upon a swap rate curve with interest rates ranging from 0.1% to 3.8% based upon swap rates adjusted for various risk adjustments.
24090_15_ITEM15_P133_S1	The fair value of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in the overall management of interest rate risk, which seeks to minimize exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment maturities with amounts due under insurance contracts.
24090_15_ITEM15_P134_S0	Various assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit reserves of life insurance include the following: a) valuation interest rates from 4% to 9% per year; b) mortality assumptions are from the 1955 to 1960, 1965 to 1970, 1975 to 1980 and 2001 Select and Ultimate mortality tables; and c) withdrawals are based primarily on actual historical termination rates.
24090_15_ITEM15_P135_S0	The following table presents information on changes in the liability for life, accident and health and property policy and contract claims for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
24090_15_ITEM15_P136_S0	The Company experienced favorable development in 2014 of which $0.6 million was primarily related to SPLIC.
24090_15_ITEM15_P136_S1	IRC Section 7702 remediation claims costs have added $ 591,000 to the prior years claims incurred making it look less favorable than actual experience.
24090_15_ITEM15_P137_S0	The favorable developments in 2013 of $417,000 primarily related to CICA and the favorable development in 2012 of $687,000 was primarily related to the release of higher claim reserves in SPLIC due to longer claim reporting lags following Hurricane s and the relocation of insured lives.
24090_15_ITEM15_P137_S1	The claims related to these events have stabilized and the higher claim reserves are no longer deemed necessary.
24090_15_ITEM15_P138_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company reinsures portions of certain policies that we underwrite to limit disproportionate risks.
24090_15_ITEM15_P138_S1	During 2014 and 2013 , we retained varying amounts of individual insurance up to a maximum retention of $100,000 on any life.
24090_15_ITEM15_P138_S2	The Company also reinsures 100% of our accidental death benefit rider coverage.
24090_15_ITEM15_P138_S3	Catastrophe reinsurance is in place for our property policies.
24090_15_ITEM15_P138_S4	In 2014 and 2013 , this reinsurance provided $10,000,000 of coverage above a $500,000 deductible.
24090_15_ITEM15_P139_S0	Our health insurance policies are substantially all reinsured on a 100% coinsurance basis.
24090_15_ITEM15_P139_S1	We remain contingently liable to the extent that the reinsuring companies cannot meet their obligations under these reinsurance treaties.
24090_15_ITEM15_P140_S0	Our amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and reserves ceded to reinsurers.
24090_15_ITEM15_P140_S1	We obtain reinsurance from multiple reinsurers, and we monitor concentration as well as financial strength ratings of our principal reinsurers.
24090_15_ITEM15_P140_S2	The ratings by A.M. Best Company range from B+ (Good) to A+ (Superior).
24090_15_ITEM15_P141_S0	To protect our position, we have established and funded a trust to cover the contingent liabilities related to accident and health reinsurance ceded to Unified Life Insurance Company, which represents $64,000 of the $4.4 million of reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM15_P142_S0	Assumed and ceded life reinsurance activity as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 is summarized as follows:
24090_15_ITEM15_P143_S0	The Company's reinsurance recoveries on ceded reinsurance were $4.4 million in 2014 and $4.4 million in 2013 .
24090_15_ITEM15_P143_S1	Premiums, claims and surrenders assumed and ceded for all lines of business for these years are summarized as follows:
24090_15_ITEM15_P144_S0	SPFIC has catastrophe reinsurance that covers the first event in excess of a $500,000 deductible up to $10.0 million .
24090_15_ITEM15_P144_S1	In consideration for a reinstatement premium, second event coverage is provided in excess of a $500,000 deductible up to $10.0 million .
24090_15_ITEM15_P144_S2	The annual premium was approximately $1.0 million in 2014 , $1.1 million in 2013 and $1.0 million in 2012 .
24090_15_ITEM15_P145_S0	The two classes of our common stock are equal in all respects, except (a) each Class A share receives twice the cash dividends paid on a per share basis to the Class B common stock; and (b) the Class B common stock elects a simple majority of the Board of Directors of Citizens and the Class A common stock elects the remaining directors.
24090_15_ITEM15_P146_S0	The table below shows the combined total of all of our insurance subsidiaries' capital and surplus and net income (loss) for life insurance operations and property insurance operations, although these amounts are not all available as dividends to Citizens, Inc., because only CICA is directly owned by Citizens, Inc.
24090_15_ITEM15_P146_S1	All other subsidiaries are owned by CICA.
24090_15_ITEM15_P147_S0	Generally, the net assets of the insurance subsidiaries available for transfer to their immediate parent are limited to the greater of the subsidiary net gain from operations during the preceding year or 10% of the subsidiary net statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_15_ITEM15_P147_S1	Under these practices, total surplus at December 31, 2014 was $40.0 million and net gain from operations was $(3.1) million for CICA.
24090_15_ITEM15_P147_S2	Based upon statutory net gain from operations and surplus of CICA as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 , a dividend of approximately $4.0 million could be paid to the Company without prior regulatory approval in 2015 .
24090_15_ITEM15_P147_S3	Payments of dividends in excess of such amounts would generally require approval by regulatory authorities.
24090_15_ITEM15_P148_S0	CICA, CNLIC, SPLIC, MGLIC and SPFIC have calculated their risk based capital ("RBC") in accordance with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' Model Rule and the RBC rules as adopted by their respective states of domicile.
24090_15_ITEM15_P148_S1	All insurance subsidiaries exceeded RBC minimum levels at December 31, 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM15_P149_S0	In July 2004, the Company completed a private placement of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series A-1 Preferred ) to four unaffiliated institutional investors.
24090_15_ITEM15_P149_S1	We also issued to the investors warrants to purchase shares of our Class A common stock, at an exercise price of $6.95 per share, and unit warrants to purchase Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series A-2 Preferred ).
24090_15_ITEM15_P149_S2	The conversion, exercise and redemption prices, along with the number of shares and warrants, were adjusted for stock dividends paid on December 31, 2004 and on December 30, 2005.
24090_15_ITEM15_P150_S0	All outstanding warrants were exercised or expired in 2012 and none were remaining as of December 31, 2013.
24090_15_ITEM15_P151_S0	The fair value of the warrants was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and was classified as a liability on the balance sheet.
24090_15_ITEM15_P152_S0	The change in fair value of warrants for the year ended December 31, 2012 caused an increase in revenues of $0.5 million .
24090_15_ITEM15_P153_S0	In the first quarter of 2015, we announced that we identified that a substantial portion of the life insurance policies issued by our subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702 and 7702A of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") of 1986.
24090_15_ITEM15_P153_S1	This tax code section allows for qualifying products sold to clients to have favorable tax treatment such as the death benefit is not taxable.
24090_15_ITEM15_P153_S2	By identifying certain products that we have sold with the intention of this favorable tax treatment but in fact they do not qualify under the IRC rules, our policyholders may now be subject to additional tax liabilities.
24090_15_ITEM15_P154_S0	The policies at issue were primarily sold to non-U.S. citizens residing abroad.
24090_15_ITEM15_P154_S1	Based upon a review of the options available to the Company we have determined that will not remediate our endowments and endowment like products we have sold to non-U.S. citizens.
24090_15_ITEM15_P154_S2	We do intend to remediate the domestic products we have sold to U.S. citizens.
24090_15_ITEM15_P154_S3	Failure of these policies to qualify under Sections 7702 and 7702A has resulted in additional expenses as described below.
24090_15_ITEM15_P155_S0	The products have been and continue to be appropriately reported under U.S. GAAP for financial reporting.
24090_15_ITEM15_P156_S0	The failure of these policies to qualify under Sections 7702 and 7702A resulted in additional expense of $ 11.4 million, after tax, related to projected IRS toll charges and fees of $ 10.1 million as well as claims liability for past claims and reserves increases to bring policies into compliance totaling $ 1.3 million.
24090_15_ITEM15_P156_S1	The range of financial estimates relative to this issue is $11.4 million to $40.0 million , after tax.
24090_15_ITEM15_P156_S2	This estimated range includes projected toll charges and fees as well as increased claims liability for past claims, reserves increases to bring policies into compliance and other probable liabilities resulting from this tax compliance matter.
24090_15_ITEM15_P156_S3	Our estimated range reflects the uncertainties with respect to the required course of action and other matters unknown at this time.
24090_15_ITEM15_P156_S4	Currently, management believes there is not a specific estimable amount for these probable liabilities and expenses which is more likely than other specific amounts within our estimated range.
24090_15_ITEM15_P157_S0	The process of determining our estimated range was a complex undertaking and involved management s judgment based upon a variety of factors known at the time.
24090_15_ITEM15_P157_S1	In addition, it is reasonably possible that we may incur additional costs associated with this issue in 2015 related to system remediation and consulting costs.
24090_15_ITEM15_P157_S2	We believe these costs could be $0.5 million to $0.8 million but due to the uncertainty of actions we cannot reasonably estimate these costs with any reliability.
24090_15_ITEM15_P157_S3	Actual amounts incurred may exceed this estimate and will be recorded as they become probable and can be reasonably estimated.
24090_15_ITEM15_P158_S0	We are a defendant in a lawsuit filed on August 6, 1999 , in the Texas District Court, Austin, Texas, now styled Delia Bolanos Andrade, et al., Plaintiffs, v. Citizens Insurance Company of America, et al., Defendants in which a class was originally certified by the trial court and reversed by the Texas Supreme Court in 2007 with an order to the trial court to conduct further proceedings consistent with its ruling.
24090_15_ITEM15_P158_S1	The underlying lawsuit alleged that certain life insurance policies CICA made available to non-U.S. residents, when combined with a policy feature that allowed certain cash benefits to be assigned to two non-U.S. trusts for the purpose of accumulating ownership of our Class A common stock, along with allowing the policyholders to make additional contributions to the trusts, were actually offers and sales of securities that occurred in Texas by unregistered dealers in violation of the Texas securities laws.
24090_15_ITEM15_P158_S2	The remedy sought was rescission and return of the insurance premium payments.
24090_15_ITEM15_P158_S3	On December 9, 2009 , the trial court denied the recertification of the class after conducting additional proceedings in accordance with the Texas Supreme Court's ruling.
24090_15_ITEM15_P158_S4	The remaining plaintiffs must now proceed individually, and not as a class, if they intend to pursue their claims against us.
24090_15_ITEM15_P158_S5	Since the December 9, 2009 trial court ruling, no individual cases have been further pursued by the plaintiffs.
24090_15_ITEM15_P158_S6	The probability of the plaintiffs further pursuing their cases individually is unknown.
24090_15_ITEM15_P158_S7	An estimate of any possible loss or range of losses cannot be made at this time in regard to individuals pursuing claims.
24090_15_ITEM15_P158_S8	However, should the plaintiffs further pursue their claims individually, we intend to vigorously defend any proceedings.
24090_15_ITEM15_P159_S0	In 2007 and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the Attorney General for the State of Louisiana filed suit against SPFIC and every other homeowner insurer doing business in the State of Louisiana, on behalf of the State of Louisiana and certain Road Home fund recipients.
24090_15_ITEM15_P160_S0	State of Louisiana resolving all claims against SPFIC in the Road Home matter for approximately $183,000 .
24090_15_ITEM15_P160_S1	This amount did not have a material impact on the consolidated financials.
24090_15_ITEM15_P161_S0	As part of our efforts to review and improve our compliance controls, we discovered potential non-compliance with Treasury regulations such as Section 7702, described earlier, as well as unrelated applicable BSA requirements.
24090_15_ITEM15_P161_S1	Although we are not yet able to determine the extent of any oversights or estimate any other potential loss, we cannot assure you that the impact of any non-compliance will not have a material impact upon the company.
24090_15_ITEM15_P162_S0	Unclaimed Property Contingencies The Company is currently performing an internal audit related to unclaimed property for all legal reporting entities.
24090_15_ITEM15_P162_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company had been informed by the Louisiana Department of Treasury, Arkansas Auditor of State and the Texas State Comptroller, that they authorized an audit of Citizens, Inc. and its affiliates for compliance with unclaimed property laws.
24090_15_ITEM15_P162_S2	This audit is being conducted by Verus Financial LLC on behalf of the states.
24090_15_ITEM15_P162_S3	These internal and external audits may result in additional payments to beneficiaries, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws, administrative penalties, interest, and changes to the Company's procedures for the identification and escheatment of abandoned property.
24090_15_ITEM15_P162_S4	At this time, the Company is not able to estimate any of these possible amounts, but such costs could be substantial for a company our size.
24090_15_ITEM15_P163_S0	However, in doing so, we could incur significant defense costs, including attorneys' fees, other direct litigation costs and the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_15_ITEM15_P163_S1	If we suffer an adverse judgment as a result of litigation claims, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_15_ITEM15_P164_S0	We have the following lease commitments as of December 31, 2014 with the payments due by the periods indicated below.
24090_15_ITEM15_P165_S0	Operating lease expense was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , and $0.6 million and $0.6 million for the same periods ended 2013 and 2012 .
24090_15_ITEM15_P166_S0	The Company has three reportable segments: Life Insurance, Home Service Insurance, and Other Non-Insurance Enterprises.
24090_15_ITEM15_P166_S1	The accounting policies of the segments are in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are the same as those described in the summary of significant account policies.
24090_15_ITEM15_P167_S0	We evaluate profit and loss performance based on U.S. GAAP net income before federal income taxes for our three reportable segments.
24090_15_ITEM15_P168_S0	The Company has no reportable differences between segments and consolidated operations.
24090_15_ITEM15_P169_S0	The table below summarizes assets by segment.
24090_15_ITEM15_P170_S0	Major categories of earned premiums are summarized as follows:
24090_15_ITEM15_P171_S0	The following table sets forth the Company's annual total of earned premiums from geographic area for the years indicated:
24090_15_ITEM15_P172_S0	Our federal income tax expense was $3.7 million , $2.1 million and $1.5 million in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
24090_15_ITEM15_P172_S1	This represents effective tax rates of (134.0)% , 30.8% and 25.0% , respectively.
24090_15_ITEM15_P172_S2	The current year impact is the result of costs to remediate the tax compliance issue we identified in 2015 which impacted our current year effective tax rate negatively by approximately $3.5 million due to approximately $ 10.0 million of these costs not being deductible for tax.
24090_15_ITEM15_P173_S0	The Company previously had a valuation allowance related to OTTI writedowns on stocks and stock mutual funds in 2008.
24090_15_ITEM15_P173_S1	Due to the sale of these mutual funds in 2009 and 2010, the valuation allowance was released in its entirety in 2009 and 2010.
24090_15_ITEM15_P173_S2	Part of this valuation allowance was released to other comprehensive income ("OCI") in 2009 due to the increase in fair value of mutual funds and stocks still owned.
24090_15_ITEM15_P173_S3	As the stocks and mutual funds have been disposed of since 2009, this valuation allowance has been released as reductions of tax expense.
24090_15_ITEM15_P173_S4	During 2014, 2013 and 2012, $21,000 , and $20,000 and $188,000 has been released as a reduction of tax expense, respectively.
24090_15_ITEM15_P174_S0	The table below summarizes the changes in the valuation allowance.
24090_15_ITEM15_P175_S0	A reconciliation of federal income tax expense computed by applying the federal income tax rate of 35% in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 to income (loss) before federal income tax expense is as follows:
24090_15_ITEM15_P176_S0	Income tax expense (benefit) consists of:
24090_15_ITEM15_P177_S0	Deferred tax benefit is comprised of $79.2 million deferred tax benefit and $21,000 tax benefit released from OCI.
24090_15_ITEM15_P178_S0	The components of deferred federal income taxes are as follows:
24090_15_ITEM15_P179_S0	A summary of the changes in the components of deferred federal and state income taxes is as follows:
24090_15_ITEM15_P180_S0	The Company and our subsidiaries had net operating losses at December 31, 2014 available to offset future taxable income of approximately $47,000 , expiring at various times through 2024.
24090_15_ITEM15_P180_S1	A portion of the net operating loss carryforward is subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
24090_15_ITEM15_P181_S0	At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we determined that as a result of our historical income, projected future income, tax planning strategies, and the nature of the items from which the deferred tax assets are derived, other than assets for which OTTI was recorded, it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized.
24090_15_ITEM15_P182_S0	The Company has sufficient unrealized gains in its available-for-sale portfolio so as not to need a valuation allowance for OTTI writedowns.
24090_15_ITEM15_P183_S0	The Company and our subsidiaries had no capital loss carry-forwards at December 31, 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM15_P184_S0	No new additions are expected to be made to this account.
24090_15_ITEM15_P184_S1	Federal income taxes will become payable thereon at the then current tax rate (a) when and if distributions to shareholders, other than stock dividends and other limited exceptions, are made in excess of the accumulated previously taxed income; or (b) when a company ceases to be a life insurance company as defined by the Internal Revenue Code and such termination is not due to another life insurance company acquiring its assets in a nontaxable transaction.
24090_15_ITEM15_P185_S0	We do not anticipate any transactions that would cause any part of this amount to become taxable.
24090_15_ITEM15_P185_S1	However, should the balance at December 31, 2014 become taxable, the tax computed at present rates would be approximately $1.2 million .
24090_15_ITEM15_P186_S0	The Company recognizes only the impact of tax positions that, based on their technical merits, are more likely than not to be sustained upon an audit by the taxing authority.
24090_15_ITEM15_P187_S0	A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
24090_15_ITEM15_P188_S0	None of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2014 would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.
24090_15_ITEM15_P188_S1	There is a reasonable possibility that the unrecognized tax benefit relative to reserve deductions will decrease by $81.5 million within the next twelve months based upon the filing of an accounting method change in 2015.
24090_15_ITEM15_P189_S0	The Company s practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
24090_15_ITEM15_P189_S1	The Company has recorded a material interest expense uncertainty of $3.1 million , net of tax, with respect to an unrecognized tax benefit as of December 31, 2014 .
24090_15_ITEM15_P190_S0	The Company's Federal income tax return is filed on a consolidated basis with the following entities:
24090_15_ITEM15_P191_S0	CICA Life Insurance Company of America Security Plan Life Insurance Company Security Plan Fire Insurance Company Computing Technology, Inc.
24090_15_ITEM15_P192_S0	The method of allocation among companies is subject to a written tax sharing agreement, approved by the Board of Directors, whereby allocation is made primarily on a separate return basis with current credit for any net operating losses or other items utilized in the consolidated tax return.
24090_15_ITEM15_P193_S0	Intercompany tax balances are settled quarterly.
24090_15_ITEM15_P194_S0	The Company and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction and various U.S. states.

24090_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	Citizens, Inc. ( Citizens ) is an insurance holding company incorporated in Colorado serving the life insurance needs of individuals in the United States since 1969 and internationally since 1975.
24090_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	Through our insurance subsidiaries, we pursue a strategy of offering traditional insurance products in niche markets where we believe we are able to achieve competitive advantages.
24090_16_ITEM1_P0_S2	We had approximately $1.5 billion of assets at December 31, 2015 and approximately $4.5 billion of insurance in force.
24090_16_ITEM1_P0_S3	Our core insurance operations include issuing and servicing:
24090_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	We were formed in 1969 by our founder, Harold E. Riley.
24090_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	Prior to our formation, Mr. Riley had many years of experience in the international and domestic life insurance business.
24090_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	Historically, our Company has experienced growth through acquisitions in the domestic market and through organic market expansion in the international market.
24090_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	We strive to generate bottom line return using knowledge of our niche markets and our well-established distribution channels.
24090_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our business has grown, both internationally and domestically, in recent years, though our profitability has declined.
24090_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	From 2011 through 2015, revenues rose 22% from $194.2 million in 2011 to $236.3 million in 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM1_P3_S2	During that same period, our assets grew 37% from $1,079.5 million to $1,484.0 million .
24090_16_ITEM1_P3_S3	During this same period, our net income declined 142% from $8.5 million to a net loss of $(3.6) million, primarily as a result of other than temporary impairments ("OTTI"), expense related to additional tax liability contingency and higher consulting costs in 2015.
24090_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	"Selected Financial Data" and Item 7.
24090_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this Report.
24090_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	In June 2015, the Company's Board of Directors appointed Harold E. Riley as Chairman Emeritus and his son Rick D. Riley as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.
24090_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	The Board also promoted former Chief Financial Officer Kay E. Osbourn to Chief Corporate Officer and President, promoted Geoffrey M. Kolander to Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Strategy and hired David S. Jorgensen as Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
24090_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	In October 2015, Rick Riley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, assumed leadership of our international business, replacing Randall H. Riley, the international marketing officer of one of our primary insurance subsidiaries, CICA Life Insurance Company of America.
24090_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Company's Board of Directors and executive management team are currently assessing the Company's business model and business strategies with the assistance and support of external consultants and advisors.
24090_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	Specifically, we are evaluating certain elements and assumptions underlying the Company's historical business model to consider potential changes to align with our risk profile, the current economic and regulatory environment and sustainable business objectives.
24090_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	Incorporated in our business model review are analyses of (1) our products and profitability; (2) a potential restructuring of our international business and operations; (3) potential upgrades to our technology systems and operations with a strategic focus on cyber risk and our future business needs; and (4) potential changes in our executive management structure, personnel needs and compensation incentives.
24090_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	A prolonged low interest rate period has forced us to revisit the benefits and dividends included under many policies offered internationally.
24090_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	In many cases, policy holders stand to benefit from significantly higher guarantees and dividends than the financial markets might otherwise offer.
24090_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	As such, the Company has responded to cut discretionary dividends on existing policies and revisit the structure of new policies sold internationally to better reflect the prolonged low interest rate environment that we face.
24090_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Company also is revisiting its investment strategies for premiums received in order to augment its rate of return.
24090_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	By combining more conservative interest rate features in our insurance policies with a more flexible investment strategy to manage our investment portfolio, we intend to grow bottom line returns to shareholders.
24090_16_ITEM1_P9_S2	There is risk that these changes will result in lower demand for new policies, or that the financial markets will make our investment strategy more difficult.
24090_16_ITEM1_P9_S3	Despite the risks, the Company believes that such moves are in the best interest of our shareholders.
24090_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	The following pages describe the operations of our three business segments: Life Insurance, Home Service and Other Non-Insurance Enterprises.
24090_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	Revenues derived from any single customer did not exceed 10% of consolidated revenues in any of the last three years.
24090_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our Life Insurance segment issues ordinary whole life insurance in the United States and in U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents.
24090_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	These contracts are designed to provide a fixed amount of insurance coverage over the life of the insured and can utilize rider benefits to provide additional increasing or decreasing coverage and annuity benefits to enhance accumulations.
24090_16_ITEM1_P11_S2	Additionally, endowment contracts are issued by the Company, which are principally accumulation contracts that incorporate an element of life insurance protection.
24090_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	For the majority of our business, we retain the first $100,000 of risk on any one life, reinsuring the remainder of the risk.
24090_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	We operate this segment through our subsidiaries: CICA Life Insurance Company of America ("CICA") and Citizens National Life Insurance Company ("CNLIC").
24090_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	We focus our sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies to residents in Latin America and the Pacific Rim.
24090_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	As of December 31, 2015, we had insurance policies in force in approximately 30 countries, including Columbia, Venezuela, Taiwan, Ecuador and Argentina as our top producing countries.
24090_16_ITEM1_P13_S2	In 2015, international direct premiums comprised approximately 72% of our total direct premiums, and exceeded 10% or more of our premiums for each of the last three years.
24090_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	We have participated in the foreign marketplace since 1975.
24090_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	We believe positive attributes of our international insurance business include:
24090_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	persistency experience and mortality rates that are comparable to our U.S. policies.
24090_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	We have implemented several policies and procedures to limit the risks of asset and premium loss relating to our international business.
24090_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	Approvals for policy issuance are made in our Austin, Texas office and policies are issued and delivered to the independent consultants, who deliver the policies to the insureds.
24090_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	We have no offices, employees or assets outside of the United States.
24090_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	Insurance policy applications and premium payments are submitted by the independent consultants or customers to us, and we review the applications in our home offices in Austin, Texas.
24090_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	Premiums are paid in U.S. Dollars by check, wire or credit card.
24090_16_ITEM1_P17_S3	The policies we issue contain limitations on benefits for certain causes of death, such as homicide and careless driving.
24090_16_ITEM1_P17_S4	We have also developed disciplined underwriting criteria, which include medical reviews of applicants as well as background and reference checks.
24090_16_ITEM1_P17_S5	In addition, we have a claims policy that requires investigation of substantially all death claims.
24090_16_ITEM1_P17_S6	Furthermore, we perform background reviews and reference checks of prospective independent marketing firms and consultants.
24090_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	Independent marketing firms and consultants specialize in marketing life insurance products and generally have several years of insurance marketing experience.
24090_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	We maintain contracts with the independent marketing firms pursuant to which they provide recruitment, training and supervision of their managers and associates in the service and placement of our products; however, all associates of these firms also contract directly with us as independent contractors and receive their compensation directly from us.
24090_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	Accordingly, should an arrangement between any independent marketing firm and us be terminated for any reason, we expect that we would seek to continue with the existing marketing arrangements with the associates of these firms.
24090_16_ITEM1_P18_S3	Our agreements with independent marketing firms and consultants typically provide that they are independent contractors responsible for their own operation expenses and are the representative of the prospective insured.
24090_16_ITEM1_P18_S4	In addition, the marketing firms guarantee any debts of their associates to us.
24090_16_ITEM1_P18_S5	The marketing firms receive commissions on all new and renewal policies serviced or placed by them or their associates.
24090_16_ITEM1_P18_S6	All of these contracts provide that the independent marketing firms and consultants are aware of and responsible for compliance with local laws.
24090_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	We offer several ordinary whole life insurance and endowment products designed to meet the needs of our non-U.S. policyowners.
24090_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	These policies have been structured to provide:
24090_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	lifetime income guarantees for an insured or for surviving beneficiaries.
24090_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our international products have living benefit features.
24090_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	Every policy contains guaranteed cash values and is participating (i.e., provides for cash dividends as apportioned by the board of directors).
24090_16_ITEM1_P21_S2	Once a policyowner pays the annual premium and the policy is issued, the owner becomes entitled to a cash dividend as well as an annual guaranteed endowment, if elected.
24090_16_ITEM1_P21_S3	The policyowner has several options with regard to the dividend and annual guaranteed endowments, including the right to assign policy values to the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan, registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), and administered in the United States by Computershare, our plan administrator and transfer agent.
24090_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	The life insurance business is highly competitive.
24090_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	We compete with a large number of stock and mutual life insurance companies internationally and domestically, as well as with financial institutions that offer insurance products.
24090_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	There are more than 800 life insurance companies in the United States, some of which also provide insurance to foreign residents.
24090_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	We face competition primarily from companies formed and operated in the country in which the insureds reside, from companies that operate in the same manner as we do and from companies that are foreign to the countries in which policies are sold, but issue insurance policies denominated in the local currency of those countries.
24090_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	A substantial number of companies may be deemed to have a competitive advantage over us due to their significantly greater financial resources, histories of successful operations and larger marketing forces.
24090_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	Because premiums on our international policies are paid in U.S. Dollars, and we pay claims and benefits in U.S. Dollars, we provide a product that is different from the products offered by foreign-domiciled companies.
24090_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	We believe our international policies are usually acquired by individuals in the upper middle class in their countries and those with significant net worth and earnings that place them in the upper income brackets of their respective countries.
24090_16_ITEM1_P26_S2	The policies sold by our foreign competitors are generally offered broadly and are priced using the mortality of the entire population of the geographic region.
24090_16_ITEM1_P26_S3	Our mortality charges are therefore typically lower, which provides a competitive advantage.
24090_16_ITEM1_P26_S4	Additionally, the assets backing the reserves for our foreign competitors' policies must be substantially invested in their respective countries and, therefore, are exposed to the inflationary risks and social or economic crises that have been more common in these foreign countries.
24090_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	In 2015, domestic direct premiums comprised approximately 28% of our total direct premiums.
24090_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	The majority of our domestic inforce business results from blocks of business of insurance companies we have acquired over the past 17 years.
24090_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	Our acquisition transition strategy focuses on the introduction of our cash accumulation ordinary whole life products to independent marketing consultants associated with companies we have acquired, while continuing to service the needs of acquired policyholders.
24090_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	In the Mountain West, Midwest and the southern United States, we seek to serve middle-income households through the sale of cash accumulation ordinary whole life insurance products.
24090_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	Our distribution strategy is through independent agents.
24090_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	Over the past few years, new product sales have been modest while existing policies have been running off at a greater pace compressing the block of insurance in force.
24090_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our domestic life insurance products focus primarily on living needs and provide benefits focused toward accumulating money for the policyowner.
24090_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	The features of our domestic life insurance products include:
24090_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	an option to waive premium payments in the event of disability.
24090_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our life insurance products are principally designed to address the insured's concern about outliving his or her monthly income, while at the same time providing death benefits.
24090_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	The primary purpose of our product portfolio is to help the insured create capital for needs such as retirement income, children's higher education funds, business opportunities, emergencies and health care needs.
24090_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	The U.S. life insurance industry is a mature industry that, in recent years, has experienced little to no growth.
24090_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	Competition is intense because the life insurance industry is consolidating, with larger, more efficient and more effective organizations emerging from consolidation.
24090_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	Many domestic life insurance companies have significantly greater financial, marketing forces and other resources, longer business histories and more diversified lines of insurance products than we do.
24090_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	We also face competition from companies marketing in person as well as with direct mail and Internet sales campaigns.
24090_16_ITEM1_P34_S2	Although we may be at a competitive disadvantage to these entities, we believe our premium rates and policy features are generally competitive with those of other life insurance companies selling similar types of ordinary whole life insurance.
24090_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	Our domestic Home Service segment operates in this market through our subsidiaries Security Plan Life Insurance Company ("SPLIC"), Magnolia Guaranty Life Insurance Company ("MGLIC") and Security Plan Fire Insurance Company ("SPFIC"), and focuses on the life insurance needs of the middle and lower income markets, primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	Our policies are sold and serviced through a home service marketing distribution system of approximately 313 employee-agents who work on a route system and through over 307 funeral homes and independent agents to sell policies, collect premiums and service policyholders.
24090_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	To a lesser extent, our Home Service segment sells limited-liability, named peril property policies covering dwelling and contents.
24090_16_ITEM1_P35_S3	In 2015, our Home Service segment comprised 24%, or $47.6 million of our total direct premiums.
24090_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our home service insurance products consist primarily of small face amount ordinary whole life and pre-need policies, which are designed to fund final expenses for the insured, primarily consisting of funeral and burial costs.
24090_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	The average life insurance policy face amount issued was approximately $6,700 in 2015 ; therefore, the underwriting performed on these applications is limited.
24090_16_ITEM1_P36_S2	Our property coverages are limited to $30,000 maximum coverage on any one dwelling and contents, while content-only coverage and dwelling-only coverage is limited to $20,000 .
24090_16_ITEM1_P36_S3	We face competition in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas from other companies specializing in home service distribution of insurance.
24090_16_ITEM1_P36_S4	We seek to compete based upon our emphasis on personal service to our customers.
24090_16_ITEM1_P36_S5	We intend to continue premium growth within this segment via direct sales and acquisitions.
24090_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	Other Non-insurance Enterprises includes Computing Technology, Inc., which provides data processing services to the Company, and Insurance Investors, Inc., which provides aviation transportation to the Company.
24090_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	This segment also includes the results of Citizens, Inc., the parent Company.
24090_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our administrative operations principally serve our life insurance segment and are conducted primarily at our executive offices in Austin, Texas through approximately 122 administrative, operating and underwriting personnel.
24090_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	Our Home Service operations are conducted to a large degree from our district offices in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, as well as our service center in Donaldsonville, Louisiana.
24090_16_ITEM1_P39_S2	At our executive offices, we also perform policy design, marketing oversight, underwriting, accounting and reporting, actuarial, customer service, claims processing, administration and investing activities.
24090_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	We have a single integrated system for our entire Company, which is a centrally-controlled, mainframe-based administrative system.
24090_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	Functions of our policy administrative system include policy set up, administration, billing and collections, commission calculation, valuation, automated data edits, storage backup, image management and other related functions.
24090_16_ITEM1_P40_S2	Each company we acquire is ultimately converted onto our administrative system.
24090_16_ITEM1_P40_S3	This system has been in place for more than 30 years and operated across multiple platforms and operating environments as technological efficiencies evolved.
24090_16_ITEM1_P40_S4	We update our administrative system on an ongoing basis but it does require programmers experienced in our IT environment.
24090_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	We are currently reviewing technology options to transition from our legacy administration system to an upgraded, modernized technology platform that will service our needs into the future.
24090_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	The Company has recently established an enterprise risk management function ( ERM ) that is charged with providing analyses of the Company s risks on an individual and aggregated basis and with ensuring that the Company s risks remain within its risk appetite and tolerances.
24090_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	The Company's focus on ERM strengthens its risk management culture and discipline.
24090_16_ITEM1_P42_S2	The mission of ERM is to support the Company in achieving its strategic priorities by:
24090_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	Providing insight to assist in growing the businesses and achieving optimal risk-adjusted returns within established guidelines.
24090_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	While it is the job of the CEO and senior management to assess and manage the Company risk exposure, the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors is charged with discussing guidelines and policies to govern the process by which ERM is handled.
24090_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	The Audit Committee periodically discusses the Company s major financial risk exposure and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures.
24090_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	The categories of risk exposures assessed and managed by senior management include, but are not limited to:
24090_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Any other risk that poses a material threat to the strategic viability of the Company.
24090_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our U.S. insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations.
24090_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	State insurance laws establish supervisory agencies with broad regulatory authority to regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of each state in which they are licensed.
24090_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	Act of 2001, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("the Dodd-Frank Act"), are examples of U.S. regulations that affect our business.
24090_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	We are subject to comprehensive regulations under the USA Patriot Act and the Bank Secrecy Act with respect to money laundering, as well as federal regulations regarding privacy and confidentiality.
24090_16_ITEM1_P48_S2	Our insurance products and thus our businesses also are affected by U.S. federal, state and local tax laws.
24090_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act focuses on financial reform and may result in significant changes to the regulation of institutions operating in the financial services industry, including the Company.
24090_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	Legislative or regulatory requirements imposed by or promulgated in connection with this Act may make it more expensive for the Company to conduct its business, may have a material adverse effect on the overall business climate and could materially affect the profitability of the results of operations and financial condition of financial institutions.
24090_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	The Company is uncertain as to all of the impacts this legislation will have and cannot provide assurance it will not adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1_P49_S3	In general, government regulation at the federal level may increase and may result in unpredictable consequences for the Company.
24090_16_ITEM1_P49_S4	In addition, other federal laws and regulations apply to us in areas such as pension regulations, privacy, tort reform and taxation.
24090_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	The purpose of the laws and regulations that affect our insurance business is primarily to protect our insureds and not our stockholders.
24090_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations.
24090_16_ITEM1_P50_S2	In addition, insurance regulatory authorities (including state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general) periodically make inquiries and regularly conduct examinations regarding compliance by us and our subsidiaries with insurance, and other laws and regulations regarding the conduct of our insurance businesses.
24090_16_ITEM1_P50_S3	We cooperate with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action when warranted.
24090_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are collectively licensed to transact business in 32 states.
24090_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	We have insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the states of Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.
24090_16_ITEM1_P51_S2	Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are licensed and regulated in all U.S. jurisdictions in which they conduct insurance business.
24090_16_ITEM1_P51_S3	The extent of this regulation varies, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations based upon the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) model rules governing the financial condition of insurers, including standards of solvency, types and concentration of investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, credit for reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy, and the business conduct of insurers, including marketing and sales practices and claims handling.
24090_16_ITEM1_P51_S4	In addition, statutes and regulations usually require the licensing of insurers and their agents, the approval of policy forms and related materials and the approval of rates for certain types of insurance products.
24090_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	All U.S. jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries conduct insurance business have enacted legislation that requires each U.S. insurance company in a holding company system, except captive insurance companies, to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its jurisdiction of domicile and to furnish that regulatory authority financial and other information concerning the operations of, and the interrelationships and transactions among, companies within its holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system.
24090_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	These laws and regulations also regulate transactions between insurance companies and their parents and affiliates.
24090_16_ITEM1_P52_S2	Generally, these laws and regulations require that all transactions within a holding company system between an insurer and its affiliates be fair and reasonable and that the insurer's statutory capital and surplus following any transaction with an affiliate be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.
24090_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	Statutory surplus is the excess of admitted assets over the sum of statutory liabilities and capital.
24090_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	For certain types of agreements and transactions between an insurer and its affiliates, these laws and regulations require prior notification to, and non-disapproval or approval by, the insurance regulatory authority of the insurer's jurisdiction of domicile.
24090_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	We have never qualified to do business in any foreign country and have never submitted our insurance policies issued to residents of foreign countries for approval by any foreign or domestic insurance regulatory agency.
24090_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	We sell our policies to residents of foreign countries using foreign independent marketing firms and independent consultants, and we rely on those persons to comply with laws applicable to them in marketing our insurance products in their respective countries.
24090_16_ITEM1_P54_S2	We recently have undertaken a comprehensive compliance review of risks associated with foreign insurance laws and regulations, with assistance from independent outside advisors.
24090_16_ITEM1_P54_S3	We cannot predict the outcome of this review and cannot assure you that any of these laws, regulations, or application of them by foreign regulatory authorities will not have an adverse effect on the marketing efforts of our independent marketing consultants and, in turn, on our revenues and profitability.
24090_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	The payment of dividends or other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by the insurance laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile.
24090_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	The laws and regulations of some of these jurisdictions also prohibit an insurer from declaring or paying a dividend except out of its earned surplus or require the insurer to obtain regulatory approval before it may do so.
24090_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	us (such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employee or other services) if they determine such payment could be adverse to policyholders or insurance contract holders of the subsidiary.
24090_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled require that a controlling party obtain the approval of the insurance commissioner of the insurance company's jurisdiction of domicile prior to acquiring control of the insurer and may delay, deter or prevent a transaction our shareholders might consider desirable.
24090_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	Risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements are imposed on life and property and casualty insurance companies.
24090_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	The NAIC has established minimum capital requirements in the form of RBC.
24090_16_ITEM1_P58_S2	RBC factors the type of business written by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company's business to develop a minimum level of capital called "authorized control level risk-based capital" and compares this level to adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves.
24090_16_ITEM1_P58_S3	Should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk-based capital fall below 200%, a series of actions by the affected company would begin.
24090_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	Government actions in response to the recent financial crisis and market volatility could significantly impact our current regulations.
24090_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	As part of a comprehensive reform of financial services regulation known as the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress established an office within the federal government to collect information about the insurance industry, recommend standards, and represent the United States in dealing with foreign insurance regulators.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investing in our Company involves certain risks.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Set forth below are certain risks with respect to our Company.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Readers should carefully review these risks, together with the other information contained in this report.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties we have described in this report are not the only ones we face.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem not material, may also adversely affect our business.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Any of the risks discussed in this report or that are presently unknown or not material, if they were to actually occur, could result in a significant adverse impact on our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	References in the risk factors below to "we," "us," "our," "Citizens" and like terms relate to Citizens, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statement basis, unless specifically identified otherwise.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We operate our subsidiaries as separate and distinct entities with respect to corporate formalities.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The majority of our sales derive from residents of foreign countries and are subject to risks associated with political instability, currency control laws and foreign insurance laws.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	A significant loss of sales in these foreign markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The majority of our direct premiums, approximately 72% in 2015, are from foreign countries, primarily those in Latin America and the Pacific Rim.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	These sales are made through independent consultants who are located in these foreign countries.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of these countries have a history of political instability, including regime changes, political uprisings, currency fluctuations and anti-democratic or anti-U.S. policies.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	There is a risk that political instability in these countries could have a material adverse effect on the ability of people living in these countries to purchase our insurance policies or our ability to sell our policies in those countries through our independent consultants or otherwise.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Company s future sales and financial results depend upon avoiding significant regulatory interruptions in receiving insurance policy applications and premiums from, and issuing insurance policies to, residents outside of the United States.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Currency control laws or other currency exchange restrictions in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our revenues by imposing restrictions on asset transfers outside of a country where our insureds reside.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries could prevent our insureds in those countries from purchasing or paying premiums on our policies.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	There can be no assurance that such restrictions will not be imposed and that our revenues, results of operations and financial condition will not be materially adversely affected if they do occur.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We also face risks associated with the application of foreign laws to our sales of policies to residents in foreign countries.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	to and accepted only in our offices in the U.S., and requiring that policy premiums be paid to us in U.S. Dollars.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Because we consider ourselves to be doing business only in the U.S., we have never sought to qualify to do business in any foreign country and have never submitted the insurance policies that we issue to residents of foreign countries for approval by any foreign or domestic insurance regulatory agency.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We have sold our policies to residents of foreign countries using independent consultants and we have relied on those persons to comply with applicable laws in marketing our insurance products.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We recently have undertaken a comprehensive review of risks associated with the potential application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in foreign countries, including laws that might require us to qualify to do business in a foreign country or to submit our policies for approval by a foreign insurance regulatory authority.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in foreign countries requires a country-by-country analysis due to the lack of uniformity of regulation in those countries, and the application of the laws of some countries to our sales of insurance policies may be uncertain due to unclear regulations or the absence of legal precedent addressing circumstances similar to ours.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	While our compliance review is ongoing and we cannot predict its ultimate outcome, preliminary results indicate a risk that the government of a foreign country could determine, under its existing laws, that its residents may not buy life insurance from us unless we become qualified to do business in that country or unless our policies purchased by its residents receive prior approval from its insurance regulators.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	There also is a risk that foreign regulators may become more aggressive in enforcing any perceived violations of their laws.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P10_S4	There is no assurance that, if a foreign country were to deem our sales of policies in that country to require that we qualify to do business in that country or submit our policies for approval by that country s regulatory authorities, we would be able to, or would conclude that it is advisable to, comply with those requirements.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Any determination by a foreign country that we or our policy sales are subject to regulation under their laws could therefore have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell policies in that country and, in turn, on our revenues and profitability.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Ultimately, we may decide to withdraw from or avoid a particular market if we conclude that we are subject to its laws and regulations.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Any disruption to the marketing and sale of our policies to residents of a foreign country, resulting from the action of foreign regulatory authorities or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our operating results and financial condition may be affected if the liabilities actually incurred differ, or if our estimates of those liabilities change, from the amounts we have reserved for in connection with the noncompliance of a portion of our life insurance policies with Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code and the failure of certain annuity contracts to qualify under Section 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We previously announced that we determined that a portion of the life and annuity insurance policies issued by our subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702 and 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") of 1986.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	To the extent that these policies had unreported income build-up, we may be liable to the IRS for failure to withhold taxes or to notify policyholders of their obligation to pay taxes directly to the IRS.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We have undertaken an analysis of our potential liability to the IRS arising from this matter, as well as other expenses we may incur to remediate (i.e., conform to the requirements of the IRS) certain previously issued domestic life insurance and annuity policies and to address any missed reporting for policies issued to non-U.S. citizens and have established a best estimate reserve of $ 14.6 million, net of tax as of December 31, 2015 for probable liabilities and expenses.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	We estimate the range of those probable liabilities and expenses to be $9.0 million to $45.5 million , net of tax.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P13_S4	This estimated range includes projected toll charges and fees payable to the IRS, as well as estimated increased payout obligations to current and former holders of non-compliant domestic life insurance policies expected to result from remediation of those policies.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P13_S5	The amount of our liabilities and expenses depends on a number of uncertainties, including the number of prior tax years for which we may be liable to the IRS, the number of domestic life insurance policies we will be required to remediate, and the methodology applicable to the calculation of taxable benefits under non-compliant policies.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Given the range of potential outcomes and the significant variables assumed in establishing our estimates, actual amounts incurred may exceed our reserve and also could exceed the high end of our estimated range of liabilities and expenses.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P13_S7	To the extent the amount reserved by the Company is insufficient to meet the actual amount of our liability and expenses, or if our estimates of those liabilities and expenses change in the future, our financial condition and results of operation may be materially adversely affected.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We face financial and capital market risks in our operations.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	As an insurance holding company with significant investment exposure, we face material financial and capital markets risk in our operations.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Due to the low interest rate environment in recent years, we experienced significant call activity on our fixed income portfolio that decreased our investment yields compared to prior years.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We also have recorded other-than-temporary impairments in the past several years due to credit related market declines and equity market volatility.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Economic uncertainty has recently been exacerbated by the increased potential for default by one or more European sovereign debt issuers, the potential partial or complete dissolution of the Eurozone and its common currency and the negative impact of such events on global financial institutions and capital markets generally.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Actions or inactions of European governments may impact these actual or perceived risks.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Future actions or inactions of the United States government, including a shutdown of the federal government, could increase the actual or perceived risk that the U.S. may not ultimately pay its obligations when due and may disrupt financial markets.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Changes in market interest rates may significantly affect our profitability.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Some of our products, principally traditional whole life insurance with annuity riders, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our "spread," or the difference between the amounts we are required to pay under our contracts to policyholders and the rate of return we are able to earn on our investments intended to support obligations under the contracts.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Our spread is an integral component of our net income.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured, prepaid, been sold, or called at lower yields, reducing our investment margin.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our fixed income bond portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk as a significant portion of the portfolio is callable.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Lowering interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in investment margins on some of our products.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	However, our ability to lower these rates could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates, and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our investment portfolio is subject to various risks that may result in realized investment losses.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In particular, decreases in the fair value of fixed maturities may significantly reduce the value of our investments, and as a result, our financial condition may suffer.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations under these securities could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in the recognition of investment losses.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the bonds included in our portfolio and by other factors that may result in the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	In particular, at December 31, 2015 , fixed maturities represented $995.6 million or 91.5% of our total investments of $1,088.1 million .
24090_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The fair value of fixed maturities and the related investment income fluctuates depending on general economic and market conditions.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The fair value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us will generally increase or decrease in line with changes in market interest rates.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	An investment has prepayment risk when there is a risk that the timing of cash flows resulting from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The impact of value fluctuations affects our consolidated financial statements, as a large portion of our fixed maturities are classified as available-for- sale, with changes in fair value reflected in our stockholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss).
24090_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	No similar adjustment is made for liabilities to reflect a change in interest rates.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Therefore, interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect our stockholders' equity, total comprehensive income and/or cash flows.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Although at December 31, 2015 , approximately 97.4% of our fixed maturities were investment grade with 82.5% rated A or above, all of our fixed maturities are subject to credit risk.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P26_S4	If any of the issuers of our fixed maturities suffer financial setbacks, the ratings on the fixed maturities could fall (with a concurrent fall in fair value) and, in a worst-case scenario, the issuer could default on its financial obligations.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P26_S5	If the issuer defaults, we could have realized losses associated with the impairment of the securities.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities may be realized or result in future impairments, resulting in a reduction in our net income.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and are, therefore, excluded from our net income.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Our total gross unrealized losses on our available-for-sale securities portfolio at December 31, 2015 were $ 8.5 million .
24090_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	temporary and an impairment charge to earnings is taken.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Realized losses or impairments may have a material adverse effect on our net income in a particular quarterly or annual period.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, and we may be required to establish additional reserves, which in turn may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We maintain reserves to cover our estimated exposure for claims relating to our issued insurance policies.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Reserves, whether calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or statutory accounting practices prescribed by various state insurance regulators, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections, of what we expect claims will be based on mortality assumptions that are determined by various regulatory authorities.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Many reserve assumptions are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P31_S3	In addition, when we acquire other domestic life insurance companies, our assessment of the adequacy of acquired policy liabilities is subject to our estimates and assumptions.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops, and adjustments to reserves are reflected in our statements of operations for the period in which such estimates are updated.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P31_S5	Because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, future developments may require us to increase claims reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the periods in which such increases occur.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Unanticipated increases in early policyholder withdrawals or surrenders could negatively impact liquidity.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	A primary liquidity concern is the risk of unanticipated or extraordinary early policyholder withdrawals or surrenders.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Our insurance policies include provisions, such as surrender charges, that help limit and discourage early withdrawals, and we track and manage liabilities and attempt to align our investment portfolio to maintain sufficient liquidity to support anticipated withdrawal demands.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	However, early withdrawal and surrender levels may differ from anticipated levels for a variety of reasons, including changes in economic conditions, changes in policyholder behavior or financial needs, changes in relationships with our independent consultants, changes in our claims-paying ability, or increases in surrenders among more mature policies that have been in force for more than fifteen years and are no longer subject to surrender charges.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our liquidity, profitability and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	While we own a significant amount of liquid assets, a certain portion of investment assets are relatively illiquid.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If we experience unanticipated early withdrawal or surrender activity, we could exhaust all other sources of liquidity and be forced to obtain additional financing or liquidate assets, perhaps on unfavorable terms.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the availability of credit in general or more specifically in the insurance industry, the strength or weakness of the capital markets, the volume of trading activities, our credit capacity, and the perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large realized or unrealized investment losses or if the level of business activity declines due to a market downturn.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P34_S3	If we are forced to dispose of assets on unfavorable terms, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the costs of customer relationships acquired, which would increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	At December 31, 2015 , we had $165.4 million of deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	DAC represents costs that vary with and are primarily related to the successful sale and issuance of our insurance policies and are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	These costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions, solicitation and printing costs, sales material costs and some support costs, such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Under U.S. GAAP, DAC is amortized to income over the lives of the underlying policies, in relation to the profit stream.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In addition, when we acquire a block of insurance policies, we assign a portion of the purchase price to the right to receive future net cash flows from existing insurance and investment contracts and policies.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	This intangible asset, called the cost of customer relationships acquired, or CCRA, represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	At December 31, 2015 , we had $21.6 million of CCRA.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We amortize the value of this intangible asset in a manner similar to the amortization of DAC.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our amortization of DAC and CCRA generally depends upon anticipated profits from investments, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, persistency and maintenance expense margins.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We regularly review the quality of our DAC and CCRA to determine if they are recoverable from future income.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	If these costs are not recoverable, they are charged to expenses in the financial period in which we make this determination.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses, investment returns, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, lapses or persistency may cause us to increase the amortization of DAC or CCRA, or both, or to record a current period expense to increase benefit reserves, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We may be required to recognize an impairment on the value of our goodwill, which would increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the amount paid by us to acquire various life insurance companies over the fair value of their net assets at the date of the acquisition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Under U.S. GAAP, we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the "reporting unit" level, which is either an operating segment or a business that is one level below the operating segment.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Goodwill is impaired if its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	This may occur for various reasons, including changes in actual or expected earnings or cash flows of a reporting unit, generation of earnings by a reporting unit at a lower rate than similar businesses or declines in market prices for publicly traded businesses similar to our reporting units.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P44_S3	If any portion of our goodwill becomes impaired, we would be required to recognize the amount of the impairment as a current-period expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Goodwill in our consolidated financial statements was $17.3 million as of December 31, 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We are a defendant in lawsuits, which may adversely affect our financial condition and detract from the time our management is able to devote to our business, and we are subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory matters.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	From time to time we are, and have been, subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions and investigations relating to our business operations, including, but not limited to:
24090_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	disputes with our independent marketing firms, independent consultants and employee-agents over compensation, termination of contracts and related claims; disputes regarding our tax liabilities; disputes relating to reinsurance and coinsurance agreements; and disputes relating to businesses acquired and operated by us.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	In the absence of countervailing considerations, we would expect to defend any such claims vigorously.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	However, in doing so, we could incur significant defense costs, including attorneys' fees, other direct litigation costs and the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Further, if we suffer an adverse judgment as a result of any claim, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	A number of U.S. jurisdictions have been investigating life insurer practices for compliance with unclaimed property laws.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Highly publicized incidents disclosed the practice by certain companies of using data available on the U.S. Social Security Administration's Death Master File or a similar database in order to avoid paying periodic benefits under annuity contracts, but not using the same data base to determine when death benefits were owed.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P49_S2	This asymmetric conduct by certain insurers has led a number of jurisdictions to require life insurers to use this same data to identify instances where amounts under life insurance policies and annuity contracts are payable and to locate and pay beneficiaries under such contracts.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The National Conference of Insurance Legislators ("NCOIL") has adopted the Model Unclaimed Life Insurance Benefits Act ("Model Act") and several states have adopted legislation that is substantially similar to the Model Act adopted by NCOIL.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	The Model Act imposes new requirements on insurers to periodically compare their in force life insurance and annuity policies against the Death Master File, investigate any identified matches to confirm the death of the insured and determine whether benefits are due and attempt to locate the beneficiaries or, if no beneficiary can be located, escheat the policy benefit to the respective state government as unclaimed property.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P50_S2	The Model Act could result in additional payments to beneficiaries, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws, and/or administrative penalties.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P50_S3	It is also possible that life insurers may be subject to claims regarding their business practices as a result given the legal uncertainty in this area.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	law principal that life insurance policies are not due and payable until the insurance company receives due proof of death, and have further held an insurance company has no duty to search the Death Master File or other databases to determine whether deaths have occurred that have not been reported to the company.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Despite the fact we have no history of the asymmetric conduct in question, we have received notices from the Louisiana Department of Treasury, the Arkansas Auditor of State and the Texas State Comptroller, indicating they intend to audit Citizens, Inc. and certain of its affiliates for compliance with unclaimed property laws.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	The audits may result in additional payments to beneficiaries, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws, administrative penalties, interest, and changes to the Company's procedures for the identification and escheatment of abandoned property.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P52_S2	The Company believes additional escheatment of funds in Arkansas or Texas will not be material to our financial condition or results.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P52_S3	However, additional escheatment of funds in Louisiana, which may subsequently be deemed abandoned under the Louisiana Department of Treasury s audit, could be substantial for SPLIC.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P52_S4	At this time, the Company is not able to estimate any of these possible amounts.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Reinsurers with which we do business could increase their premium rates and may not honor their obligations, leaving us liable for the reinsured coverage.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We reinsure certain risks underwritten by our various insurance subsidiaries.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P54_S2	The high cost of reinsurance or lack of affordable coverage could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	We may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities and, even if highly desirable or necessary, we may not be able to obtain replacement reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts or at rates economic to us.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P55_S2	If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling or unable to bear an increase in net exposures, we may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P55_S3	In addition, our reinsurance facilities may be canceled, pursuant to their terms, upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including a change of control of our Company (generally defined as the acquisition of 10% or more of our voting equity securities) or the failure of our insurance company subsidiaries to maintain the minimum required levels of statutory surplus.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Any of these potential developments could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	In 2015 , we reinsured $516.9 million of face amount of our life insurance policies.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Amounts reinsured in 2015 represented 10.4% of the face amount of direct life insurance in force in that year.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Although the cost of reinsurance is, in some cases, reflected in premium rates, under certain reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer may increase the rate it charges us for reinsurance.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	If our cost of reinsurance were to increase, we might not be able to recover these increased costs, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P57_S2	See Note 5 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Our international and domestic markets face significant competition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P58_S1	If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, our business, results of operations and profitability may be adversely affected.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Our international marketing plan focuses on making available U.S. Dollar-denominated life insurance products to upper middle income and high net worth, high income individuals residing in more than 30 countries.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P59_S1	New competition could increase the supply of available insurance, which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive profitable rates to us, thereby adversely affecting our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Existing barriers to entry in the foreign markets we serve may not be sufficient to impede potential competitors from entering such markets.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P59_S3	In connection with our business with foreign nationals, we experience competition primarily from the following sources, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have:
24090_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Foreign operated companies with U.S. Dollar policies.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We face direct competition from companies that operate in the same manner as we operate in our international markets.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Companies foreign to the countries in which their policies are sold but that issue local currency policies.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Another group of our competitors in the international marketplace consists of companies that are foreign to the countries in which their policies are sold but issue life insurance policies denominated in the local currencies of those countries.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Local currency policies provide the benefit of assets located in the country of foreign residents, but entail risks of uncertainty due to local currency fluctuations, as well as the perceived instability and weakness of local currencies.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Locally operated companies with local currency policies.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P64_S1	We compete with companies formed and operated in the country in which our foreign insureds reside.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Generally, these companies are subject to risks of currency fluctuations, and they primarily use mortality tables based on experience of the local population as a whole.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P64_S3	These mortality tables are typically based on significantly shorter life spans than those we use.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P64_S4	As a result, the cost of insurance from these companies tends to be higher than ours.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P64_S5	Although these companies typically market their policies to a broader section of the population than do our independent marketing firms and independent consultants, there can be no assurance that these companies will not endeavor to place a greater emphasis on our target market and compete more directly with us.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	In the United States, we compete with more than 800 other life insurance companies of various sizes.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The life insurance business in the United States is highly competitive, in part because it is a mature industry that, in recent years, has experienced little to no growth in life insurance sales.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Many domestic life insurance companies have substantially greater financial resources, longer business histories, larger sales forces and more diversified lines of insurance coverage than we do.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Competition in the United States has also increased recently because the life insurance industry is consolidating, with larger, more efficient organizations emerging from the consolidation.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	In addition, from time to time, companies enter and exit the markets in which we operate, thereby increasing competition at times when there are new entrants.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P67_S1	We may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices, or for other reasons.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in any of our markets.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P68_S1	If we do not, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Sales of our insurance products may be reduced if we are unable to (i) establish and maintain commercial relationships with independent marketing firms and independent consultants, (ii) attract and retain employee agents or (iii) develop and maintain our distribution sources.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We distribute our insurance products through several distribution channels, including independent marketing firms, independent consultants and our employee agents.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P70_S1	These relationships are significant for both our revenues and our profits.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P70_S2	In our life insurance segment, we depend almost exclusively on the services of independent marketing firms and independent consultants.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P70_S3	In our home service insurance segment, we depend on employee agents whose role in our distribution process is integral to developing and maintaining relationships with policyholders.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Significant competition exists among insurers in attracting and maintaining marketers of demonstrated ability.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Some of our competitors may offer better compensation packages for marketing firms, independent consultants and agents and broader arrays of products and have a greater diversity of distribution resources, better brand recognition, more competitive pricing, lower cost structures and greater financial strength or claims paying ratings than we do.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P71_S2	We compete with other insurers for marketing firms, independent consultants and employee agents primarily on the basis of our compensation and support services.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P71_S3	Any reduction in our ability to attract and retain effective sales representatives could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Loss of the services of our senior management team, or the failure to fill key vacancies, could hinder our operations, marketing and business strategy and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or prospects.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We rely on our senior executive team comprised of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Rick D. Riley (age 62), President and Chief Corporate Officer, Kay E. Osbourn (age 49), Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, David S. Jorgensen (age 52) and Chief Legal Officer, Geoffrey M. Kolander (age 40) to develop and execute our operating and marketing plans and strategy for expanding our business.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P73_S1	We anticipate that their expertise will continue to be of substantial value in connection with our business and compliance strategies.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P73_S2	The loss of the services of any of these individuals, or the failure to fill key vacancies such as our Chief Actuary position for an extended period of time, could have a significant adverse effect on our business and prospects.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P73_S3	Due to our historical compensation philosophy that has focused primarily on cash compensation and excluded equity-based incentive compensation, employment agreements, change of control agreements or other compensation components of similar publicly traded companies, we face risk that we may limit our ability to retain and effectively incentivize our key executives and our ability to attract new executive talent in the competitive insurance industry.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P73_S4	Further, we do not carry key-man insurance policies on any of their lives.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the United States, which increases our costs of doing business and could restrict the conduct of our business.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in U.S. jurisdictions where we do business, including state insurance regulations and U.S. federal securities, tax, anti-money laundering, bank secrecy, anti-corruption and foreign asset control laws.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Insurance company regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, with substantially lesser protections to shareholders of the regulated insurance companies.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P76_S1	To that end, all the states in which we do business have insurance regulatory agencies with broad legal powers with respect to licensing companies to transact business; mandating capital and surplus requirements; regulating trade and claims practices; approving policy forms; and restricting companies' ability to enter and exit markets.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P77_S0	The capacity for an insurance company's growth in premiums is partially a function of its required statutory surplus.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus, as measured by statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by a company's state of domicile, is considered important by all state insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Failure to maintain required levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action by regulatory authorities.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Most insurance regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant, renew, suspend and revoke licenses and approvals, and could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities, including acquisitions of other insurance companies, require us to add capital to our insurance company subsidiaries, or fine us.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P78_S1	If we are unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, or if our insurance business is determined not to comply fully with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations and their interpretations, including the USA Patriot Act, our revenues, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Although the U.S. federal government has not historically regulated the insurance business, the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, expands the federal presence in insurance oversight.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P79_S1	The Act's requirements include streamlining the state-based regulation of reinsurance and non-admitted insurance (also known as surplus lines insurance, which is property or casualty insurance written by a company that is not licensed to sell policies of insurance in a given state).
24090_16_ITEM1A_P79_S2	This legislation also establishes a new Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury with powers over all lines of insurance except health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P79_S3	The Federal Insurance Office is authorized to, among other things, gather data and information to monitor aspects of the insurance industry, identify issues in the regulation of insurers about insurance matters and preempt state insurance measures under certain circumstances.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P79_S4	As this Act calls for numerous studies and contemplates further regulation, the future impact of the Act on our results of operations or our financial condition cannot be determined at this time, but could have an adverse impact on profitable operations.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Changes in U.S. regulation may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and limit our prospective growth.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Currently, the U.S. Federal Government does not directly regulate the insurance business, although initiatives for federal regulation of insurance are proposed by members of the U.S. Congress from time to time.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P81_S1	However, federal legislation, regulations and administrative policies in several other areas can materially and adversely affect insurance companies, including our business.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P81_S2	These areas include U.S. anti-money laundering laws and related regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations (collectively, the BSA ), other financial services regulations, securities regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P81_S3	In addition, various forms of direct federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Our failure to maintain effective information systems could adversely affect our business.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We must maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop new information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P83_S1	If we do not maintain adequate systems, we could experience adverse consequences, including products acquired through acquisition, inadequate information on which to base pricing, underwriting and reserve decisions, regulatory problems, failure to meet prompt payment obligations, increases in administrative expenses and loss of customers.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Some of our information technology systems and software are mainframe-based, legacy-type systems that require an ongoing commitment of resources to maintain current standards.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Due to the unique nature of our proprietary operating environment, we could have difficulty finding personnel with the skills required to provide ongoing system maintenance and development as we seek to keep pace with changes in our products and business models, information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and policyholder needs.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Our success is dependent upon, among other things, maintaining and enhancing the effectiveness of existing systems, as well as continuing to integrate, develop and enhance our information systems to support business processes in a cost-effective manner.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Our failure to protect confidential information and privacy could result in the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential corporate or customer information, damage to our reputation, loss of customers, fines, penalties and adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to privacy regulations.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P88_S1	The actions we take to protect confidential information include among other things: monitoring our record retention plans and policies and any changes in state or federal privacy and compliance requirements; maintaining secure storage facilities for tangible records; and limiting access to electronic information in order to safeguard certain information.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P89_S0	In addition, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires that we deliver a notice regarding our privacy policy both at the delivery of an insurance policy and annually thereafter.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Certain exceptions are allowed for sharing of information under joint marketing agreements.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P90_S1	However, certain state laws may require us to obtain a policyholder's consent before we share information.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We have a written information security program with appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect such confidential information.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P91_S1	Cyber security attacks are on the rise throughout the world and while we believe we have taken reasonable steps to secure our customer information we could experience a breach of data.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P91_S2	We closely monitor cyber attack attempts on our system, and we are not aware of any material breach of our cybersecurity, administrative, technical and physical safeguards or client data.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P91_S3	Nevertheless, it is possible a cyber attack could go undetected and that preventative actions we take to reduce this risk of cyber-incidents and protect our information may be insufficient to prevent cyber attacks or other security breaches.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P92_S0	If we do not comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information, we could experience adverse consequences, including regulatory sanctions, loss of reputation, litigation exposure, disruptions to our operations or significant technical, legal and operating expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P93_S0	General economic, financial market and political conditions may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected from time to time by general economic, financial market and political conditions, both in the United States and in the foreign countries where our policyowners reside.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P94_S1	These conditions include economic cycles such as: levels of consumer spending; levels of inflation; movements of the financial markets; availability of credit; fluctuations in interest rates, monetary policy or demographics; and legislative and competitive changes.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P95_S0	During periods of economic downturn, our insureds may choose not to purchase our insurance products, may terminate existing policies, permit policies to lapse or may choose to reduce the amount of coverage purchased, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Also, our sales of new insurance policies might decrease.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by applicable laws and regulations in the amounts of fees, dividends and other distributions they may make to us.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P96_S1	The inability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us in sufficient amounts for us to conduct our operations could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations or expand our business.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P97_S0	As a holding company, our principal asset is the stock of our subsidiaries.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P97_S1	We rely primarily on statutorily permissible payments from our insurance company subsidiaries, principally through service agreements we have with our subsidiaries, to meet our working capital and other corporate expenses.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P98_S0	to regulation by the states in which they are domiciled, and these payments depend primarily on approved service agreements between us and these subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, the statutory surplus (which is the excess of assets over liabilities as determined under statutory accounting practices prescribed by an insurance company's state of domicile), future statutory earnings (which are earnings as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices) and regulatory restrictions.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Generally, the net assets of our insurance company subsidiaries available for dividends are limited to either the lesser or greater (depending on the state of domicile) of the subsidiary's net gain from operations during the preceding year and 10% of the subsidiary's net statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Except to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of our subsidiaries' creditors, including policyholders, have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors and shareholders.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P100_S1	If any of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates or otherwise reorganizes, our creditors and shareholders will have no right to proceed in their own right against the assets of that subsidiary or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of the subsidiary under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to debt and equity capital and our cost of capital in seeking to expand our business.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P102_S0	The availability of equity and debt financing to us will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit capacity, as well as the possibility that investors or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets may also limit our access to equity capital for us to seek to expand our business.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P102_S2	As such, we may be forced to delay raising debt or equity capital, or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could adversely affect our ability to seek any acquisitions and negatively impact profitability of an acquisition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Unexpected losses in future reporting periods may require us to adjust the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P104_S0	We evaluate our deferred tax asset ( DTA ) quarterly for recoverability based on available evidence.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P104_S1	This process involves management's judgment about assumptions, which are subject to change from period to period due to tax rate changes or variances between our projected operating performance and our actual results.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P104_S2	Ultimately, future adjustments to the DTA valuation allowance, if any, will be determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P105_S0	The realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry back or carry forward periods under applicable tax law.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we may be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P106_S1	Such an adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and capital position.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P107_S0	We may experience greater risks associated with certain deficiencies recently identified in our BSA Program.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P108_S0	As required by the BSA regulations applicable to insurance companies, we have developed and implemented an anti-money laundering program that includes policies and procedures for complying with applicable BSA program, reporting and recordkeeping requirements and for preventing and detecting potential money laundering and other criminal activity ( BSA Program ).
24090_16_ITEM1A_P108_S1	Based on an internal risk assessment and review we began in the first quarter of 2015, we have identified certain deficiencies in our BSA Program, and we are in the process of enhancing our BSA Program with additional controls based on our internal risk assessment.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P109_S0	If our foreign policyholders reduced or ceased participation in our Stock Investment Plan (the Plan ) or if a securities regulatory authority were to deem the Plan's operation contrary to securities laws, the volume of Class A common stock purchased on the open market through the Plan, and the price of our Class A common stock, could fall.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P110_S0	More than 98% percent of the shares of Class A common stock purchased under the Plan in 2015 were purchased by foreign holders of life insurance policies (or related brokers); the remaining 2% of the shares of Class A common stock purchased under the Plan in 2015 were purchased by approximately 640 participants resident in the United States.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P110_S1	The Plan is registered with the SEC pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, but is not registered under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P110_S2	If a foreign securities regulatory authority were to determine the offer and sale of our Class A common stock under the Plan were contrary to applicable laws and regulations of its jurisdiction, such authority may issue or assert a fine, penalty or cease and desist order against us in that foreign jurisdiction.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P110_S3	There is a risk our Class A common stock price could be negatively impacted by a decrease in participation in the Plan.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P110_S4	If fewer policyholders elect to participate in the Plan, or our international premium collections were to decrease as a result of regulatory, economic, or marketing impediments, the trading volume of our Class A common stock may decline from its present levels, the demand for our Class A common stock could be negatively impacted and the price of our Class A common stock could fall.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Control of our Company, through the ownership of our Class B Common Stock, may transfer from our Founder to a 501(c)(3) charitable foundation established by our Founder, and we cannot determine whether any change in our management, operations, or operating strategies will occur as a result of such an ownership change.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Harold E. Riley, our Founder and Chairman Emeritus, is the beneficial owner of 100% of our Class B common stock, which is held in the name of the Harold E. Riley Trust ("Trust"), of which he serves as Trustee.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P112_S1	Our Class A and Class B common stock are identical in all respects, except the Class B common stock elects a simple majority of the Board and receives one-half of any cash dividends paid, on a per share basis, to the Class A shares.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P112_S2	Therefore, Mr. Riley controls our Company.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P112_S3	The Class A common stock elects the remainder of the Board.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P112_S4	The Trust documents provide that upon Mr. Riley's death, the Class B common stock will be transferred from the Trust to the Harold E. Riley Foundation, a charitable organization established under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Foundation").
24090_16_ITEM1A_P112_S5	The Foundation is organized as a public support charity for the benefit of its charitable beneficiaries, Baylor University and Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P112_S6	The Foundation is governed by 11 trustees, five of which are appointed by its sole member, Harold Riley, three of which are appointed by Baylor University and three of which are appointed by Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P112_S7	The trustees appointed by Harold Riley include himself, Dottie Riley, Rick Riley.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P112_S8	In addition, the Trust documents provide that Mr. Riley may at any time transfer the Class B common stock held by the Trust to the Foundation.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P112_S9	It is unclear what, if any, changes would occur to our board, management structure, or corporate operating strategies as a result of different ownership of our Class B common stock.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P113_S0	There are a substantial number of our shares of Class A common stock issued to our executive officers, directors and management which are eligible for future sale in the public market.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P113_S1	The sale of these shares could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fall.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P114_S0	There were 49,080,114 shares of our Class A common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM1A_P114_S1	Our executive officers, directors and management owned approximately 3,172,927 shares of our Class A common stock as of December 31, 2015 , representing approximately 6.5% of our then outstanding Class A common stock.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P114_S2	Almost all of these shares have been registered for public resale and generally may be sold freely.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P114_S3	In the event of a sale of some or all of these shares or the perceived sale of these shares, the market price of our Class A common stock could fall substantially.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P115_S0	The price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P116_S0	Our Class A common stock price has historically fluctuated and is likely to fluctuate in the future and could decline materially because of the volatility of the stock market in general, decreased participation in the Plan referred to above or a variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: quarterly or annual variations in actual or anticipated results of our operations; interest rate fluctuations; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; competition and other factors affecting the life insurance business generally; and conditions in the U.S. and world economies.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P117_S0	We interface with and distribute our products to residents of foreign countries that may be subject to the risks disclosed in our Item 1A. Risk Factor under the heading, The majority of our sales derive from residents of foreign countries and are subject to risks associated with widespread political instability, currency control laws and foreign insurance laws.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P117_S1	A significant loss of sales in these foreign markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition".
24090_16_ITEM1A_P117_S2	Accordingly, from time to time, bloggers or other social media outlets relevant to investors may focus attention on our exposure to these countries and the negative circumstances surrounding their governments, thereby subjecting us to periodic negative publicity.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P117_S3	Negative publicity on investor blogs or through other media channels could impact trading in our stock and ultimately cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fall.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as applicable state insurance laws, may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as various state insurance laws, may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a takeover attempt our shareholders might consider in their best interests.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P119_S1	As a result, our shareholders will be prevented from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our Class A common stock that may be offered by a bidder in a takeover context.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P119_S2	Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P120_S0	The following provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws make it difficult for our Class A shareholders to replace or remove our directors and have other anti-takeover effects that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt:
24090_16_ITEM1A_P121_S0	our board of directors may issue one or more series of preferred stock without the approval of our shareholders.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P122_S0	State insurance laws generally require prior approval of a change in control of an insurance company.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P122_S1	Generally, such laws provide that control over an insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the insurer.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P123_S0	In considering an application to acquire control of an insurer, an insurance commissioner generally will consider such factors as the experience, competence and financial strength of the proposed acquirer, the integrity of the proposed acquirer's board of directors and executive officers, the proposed acquirer's plans for the management and operation of the insurer, and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the acquisition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P123_S1	In addition, a person seeking to acquire control of an insurance company is required in some states to make filings prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and the target insurance company and their affiliates have sufficiently large market shares in particular lines of insurance in those states.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P123_S2	These state insurance requirements may delay, deter or prevent our ability to complete an acquisition.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P124_S0	We have never paid any cash dividends on our Class A common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P125_S0	We have never paid cash dividends on our Class A common stock, as it is our policy to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business.
24090_16_ITEM1A_P125_S1	We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
24090_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	We own our principal office in Austin, Texas, consisting of an 80,000 square foot office building in addition to approximately one acre of land nearby that houses storage facilities.
24090_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	Approximately 50,000 square feet is occupied or reserved for our operations.
24090_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also own a training facility at Lake Buchanan, Texas.
24090_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	In addition, we own other properties in Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana that are incidental to our operations.
24090_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various legal and regulatory actions which are immaterial to the Company's financial statements.
24090_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	For more information about the risks related to litigation and regulatory actions, please see the risk factor titled We are a defendant in lawsuits, which may adversely affect our financial condition and detract from the time our management is able to devote to our business, and we are subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory matters.
24090_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol CIA.
24090_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	Quarterly high and low closing prices per share of our Class A common stock as reported by the NYSE are shown below.
24090_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	The number of stockholders on record on March 7, 2016 was as follows:
24090_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	We have never paid cash dividends on our Class A or B common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
24090_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	We did not purchase any of our equity securities during any quarter in 2013 , 2014 or 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM5_P5_S0	We do not maintain any equity compensation plans or arrangements.
24090_16_ITEM5_P5_S1	Thus, we do not have any securities authorized for issuance under these types of plans, nor have we issued any options, warrants or similar instruments to purchase any of our equity securities.
24090_16_ITEM5_P6_S0	The following graph compares the change in the Company s cumulative total stockholder return on its common stock over a five-year period.
24090_16_ITEM5_P6_S1	Composite and the Hemscott Group Index, a peer group of major U.S.-based insurance companies.
24090_16_ITEM5_P7_S0	The peer group index weights individual company returns for stock market capitalization.
24090_16_ITEM5_P7_S1	The companies included in the peer group index are shown in the following table.
24090_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table presents selected financial data of the Company.
24090_16_ITEM6_P0_S1	This should be read in conjunction with Item 7.

24090_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," for information that may affect the comparability of the financial data contained in the above table.
24090_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following is management's discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations of the Company.
24090_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	It is intended to be a discussion of certain key financial information regarding the Company and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes to this report on Form 10-K.
24090_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	We conduct operations as an insurance holding company emphasizing ordinary life insurance and endowment products in niche markets where we believe we can achieve competitive advantages.
24090_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	As an insurance provider, we collect premiums on an ongoing basis to pay future benefits to our policy and contract holders.
24090_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company derives its revenues principally from 1) premiums earned for insurance coverages provided to insureds; 2) net investment income; and 3) net realized capital gains and losses.
24090_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Profitability of our insurance operations depends heavily upon the Company s underwriting discipline, as we seek to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, management of claims, use of reinsurance, the size of our in force block, actual mortality and morbidity experience, and our ability to manage our expense ratio, which we accomplish through economies of scale and management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses.
24090_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future losses based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the Company s response to competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels.
24090_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Company seeks to price our insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin.
24090_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	The profitability of fixed annuities, riders and other spread-based product features depends largely on the Company s ability to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on assets and interest credited to policyholders.
24090_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	The investment return, or yield, on invested assets is an important element of the Company s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before benefits are paid.
24090_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	The majority of the Company s invested assets have been held in fixed maturities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, primarily in asset classes of corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and government obligation bonds.
24090_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	The current and projected low interest rate environment is having a significant impact on the determination of insurance contract liabilities and assets regarding reserves and deferred acquisition costs.
24090_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	The primary investment objective for the Company is to maximize economic value, consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including the management of credit risk and interest rate sensitivity of invested assets, while generating sufficient after-tax income to meet policyholder and corporate obligations.
24090_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	The Company maintains a conservative investment strategy that may vary based on a variety of factors including business needs, regulatory requirements and tax considerations.
24090_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	In the first quarter of 2015, we determined that a portion of the life insurance policies issued by our subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") of 1986.
24090_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	As a result, we established a reserve as of December 31, 2014 of $11.4 million for probable liabilities and expenses associated with this tax compliance matter, which amount represented the low end of management s estimated range of those probable expenses and liabilities of $11.4 million to $40.0 million, net of tax.
24090_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	During 2015, we performed a by-policy calculation and have a best estimate as of December 31, 2015 of $12.6 million, after tax.
24090_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	In addition, we also booked a liability for IRC 72(s) failures related to annuity contracts of $2.5 million as of June 30, 2015.
24090_16_ITEM7_P9_S4	We have updated this liability based upon current information to $2.0 million as of December 31, 2015.
24090_16_ITEM7_P9_S5	These estimates include projected toll charges and fees payable to the IRS, as well as estimated increased payout obligations to current and former holders of non-compliant domestic life insurance policies expected to result from remediation of those policies.
24090_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	the number of domestic life insurance policies we will be required to remediate, and the methodology applicable to the calculation of taxable benefits under non-compliant policies.
24090_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Given the range of potential outcomes and the significant variables assumed in establishing our estimates, actual amounts incurred may exceed our reserve and also could exceed the high end of our estimated range of liabilities and expenses.
24090_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	To the extent the amount reserved by the Company is insufficient to meet the actual amount of our liability and expenses, or if our estimates of those liabilities and expenses change in the future, our financial condition and results of operation may be materially adversely affected.
24090_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	In addition, we will incur other expenses related to this issue in 2016, including consulting fees and potential system costs.
24090_16_ITEM7_P11_S3	We are not able to reasonably estimate these amounts as of the reporting date.
24090_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	The 2015 financial results are driven by our historical business management model and traditional life insurance product sales.
24090_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	The historically low interest rate environment continues to impact our results and our industry as investment yields are an integral component of our business operations.
24090_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Net investment income increased 11.5% and 12.2% for 2015 and 2014 , respectively, as rates have risen in 2015 compared to the prior two years.
24090_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	The average yield on the consolidated investment portfolio has changed from a yield of 4.11% in 2013 up to 4.21% in 2014 and increasing to a yield of 4.38% in 2015 as rates have risen and our new investments have been focused on municipals and corporates.
24090_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	The increase in the investment asset balances due to premium revenue growth has also contributed to the increase in net investment income.
24090_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Realized net investment losses resulted from other-than-temporary impairments on investment securities which were recorded totaling $5.4 million and $0.4 million, in 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and are reported as realized losses.
24090_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	During 2015 , claims and surrenders expense increased 15.5% from the comparable period in 2014 , primarily due to an increase in surrender benefits in the life segment compared to the 2014 levels.
24090_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	2015 change in reserves resulted in reserve decreases related to surrender activity, primarily in the life segment and after the fifteenth policy duration.
24090_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	General expense remained at an increased level due to the tax compliance issue noted above relating to product qualification under IRC section 7702 and 72(s) and remediation costs that have been identified, as well as increased consulting costs for actuarial, tax, and legal assistance.
24090_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	We completed the acquisition of MGLIC in the first quarter of 2014 and the related results have been included in our financial results.
24090_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	For over thirty-six years, CICA and its predecessors have accepted policy applications from foreign nationals for U.S. Dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies.
24090_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	We make our insurance products available using third-party marketing organizations and independent marketing consultants.
24090_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Endowment product sales have been on the rise and represented approximately 76.1% of new sales in the life segment in 2015.
24090_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	The Company currently offers a fifteen and twenty year endowment and our top selling endowment is a product that matures at age sixty-five.
24090_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	We also introduced a new product in 2013 that is an endowment at age eighteen with a payout over four or five years.
24090_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Through the domestic market of our Life Insurance segment, we provide ordinary whole life, credit life insurance, and final expense policies to middle and lower income families and individuals in certain markets in the mountain west, mid-west and southern U.S.
24090_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	The majority of our domestic revenues are generated by the policies of domestic life insurance companies we have acquired since 1987.
24090_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	We provide final expense ordinary and industrial life insurance to middle and lower income individuals in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	Our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through a home service marketing distribution system utilizing employee-agents who work on a route system to collect premiums and service policyholders, and through networks of funeral homes that collect premiums and provide personal policyholder service.
24090_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Significant economic issues impacting our business and industry currently and into the future are discussed below.
24090_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	Slow increases in the interest rate environment will limit increases in profit margins for insurers.
24090_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	We have been impacted by the historically low interest rate environment over the past several years as our fixed income investment portfolio, primarily invested in callable securities, has been reinvested at lower yields.
24090_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	The Company s conservative investment strategy has not changed but we have focused new purchases into holding of state, municipalities and essential service issuers compared to our historical investment in U.S. government holdings.
24090_16_ITEM7_P25_S3	Our investment earnings also impact the reserve and Deferred Acquisition Costs ( DAC ) balances, as assumptions are used in the development of the balances.
24090_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Due to the recent decline in investment yields on our portfolio, our projection of long-term investment returns has declined.
24090_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	This has resulted in increasing the reserves on policies issued in the current year, as well as reducing the DAC asset.
24090_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	As an increasing percentage of the world population reaches retirement age, we believe we will benefit from increased demand for living benefit products rather than death products, as customers will require cash accumulation to pay expenses to meet their lifetime income needs.
24090_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	Our ordinary life products are designed to accumulate cash values to provide for living expenses in a policy owner's later years, while continuously providing a death benefit.
24090_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	We believe there is a trend toward consolidation of domestic life insurance companies, due to significant losses incurred by the life insurance industry as a result of the credit crisis and related economic pressures, as well as increasing costs of regulatory compliance for domestic life insurance companies.
24090_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	We believe this trend should benefit our acquisition strategy as more complementary acquisition candidates may become available for us to consider.
24090_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Many of the events and trends affecting the life insurance industry have had an impact on the life reinsurance industry.
24090_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	These events have led to a decline in the availability of reinsurance.
24090_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	While we currently cede a limited amount of our primary insurance business to reinsurers, we may find it difficult to obtain reinsurance in the future, forcing us to seek reinsurers who are more expensive to us.
24090_16_ITEM7_P29_S3	If we cannot obtain affordable reinsurance coverage, either our net exposures will increase or we will have to reduce our underwriting commitments.
24090_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	While our management has extensive experience in writing life insurance policies for foreign residents, changes to foreign laws and regulations and their related application and enforcement, along with currency controls affecting our foreign resident insureds could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	On August 1, 2011, SPLIC entered into assumption reinsurance agreements with Escude Life Insurance Company in Rehabilitation, and Benton Life Insurance Company in Rehabilitation.
24090_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	At the time the agreements were executed, both companies were under receivership with the Louisiana Department of Insurance.
24090_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	In total, SPLIC assumed approximately $4.5 million in reserve liabilities and received approximately $4.6 million in cash, with a minimal reinsurance ceding commission being paid.
24090_16_ITEM7_P31_S3	These transactions are accounted for under business combination accounting and are not deemed material.
24090_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	On March 7, 2014, the Company acquired Magnolia Guaranty Life Insurance Company ("MGLIC") in the amount of $5.2 million.
24090_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	MGLIC is a Mississippi domiciled company that began writing business in 1992 and issues primarily industrial life policies through independent funeral homes in the state of Mississippi.
24090_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	We recorded $0.1 million of goodwill as a result of this transaction.
24090_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	MGLIC is reported in our home service segment.
24090_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	A discussion of consolidated results is presented below, followed by a discussion of Segment Operations and financial results by segment.
24090_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Insurance revenues are primarily generated from premium revenues and investment income.
24090_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	In addition, realized gains and losses on investment holdings can significantly impact revenues from year to year.
24090_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Premium income derived from life, accident and health, and property insurance sales, increased 3.2% during 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	The increase resulted primarily from renewal premiums, which increased 5.1% and 6.5% in the life segment for 2015 and 2014 and totaled $166.4 million , $159.7 million and $150.3 million on the consolidated level in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
24090_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	New sales, termed as first year premiums, decreased 2.7% , and increased 13.2% , and 4.0% in the life segment in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P36_S3	The decrease in new sales in the current year occurred in the last quarter of the year and may be related to the change in our marketing leadership from Randall Riley to Rick Riley which happened in October of 2015.
24090_16_ITEM7_P36_S4	Marketing transition takes time but we anticipate that our changes will be positive to the operations overall.
24090_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Endowment sales represent a significant portion of new business sales internationally with the 20-year endowment and endowment to age 65 as our top products.
24090_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	In addition, most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision, which allows the policyholder to use cash value within a policy to pay premiums.
24090_16_ITEM7_P37_S2	The policy loan asset balance increased 11.4% and 10.6% in 2015 and 2014 , year over year.
24090_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Net investment income increased to $45.8 million in 2015 compared to $41.1 million in 2014 , due to an increase in yields from new investments primarily in municipal and corporate issues and as we experienced higher average invested assets as a result of investment of new premium revenue.
24090_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	Our yield on average invested assets increased 16 basis points from 2014 to 2015 and we increased the holdings in higher quality rated securities.
24090_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Net investment income performance is summarized as follows.
24090_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	We have traditionally invested in fixed maturity securities with a large percent held in callable issues.
24090_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	The sustained low interest rate environment of the past several years is now beginning to rise as noted in the table above.
24090_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	The interest rate direction is uncertain but if market interest rates begin to rise, our call risk will diminish, resulting in our fixed securities maturing at the stated maturity dates and our portfolio yield will rise more slowly over time, as new money investments would be made at higher rates.
24090_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Investment income from fixed maturity securities accounted for approximately 83.4% of total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	We have increased our investment purchases of corporate and municipal securities over the past several years, focusing on utility service sectors in these security categories.
24090_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	In addition, we currently have $21.5 million invested in equity securities related to bond and stock mutual funds as these securities offer a competitive yield with a shorter duration.
24090_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	Investment income from fixed maturity investments increased for the year of 2015 due to a rise in overall bond yields and an increase in the portfolio from new money investment purchases as noted above relative to the fixed maturity portfolio.
24090_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	In addition, the increase in the policy loans asset balance, which represents policyholders utilizing their accumulated policy cash value, contributed to the increase to investment income.
24090_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	In 2015 , we recognized losses related to impairments on two bond mutual funds totaling $2.4 million and impairments on two bond issues totaling $3.0 million related to a utility and energy issuer.
24090_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	In 2014 , we sold two equity bond funds which resulted in a realized loss of $0.4 million.
24090_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	The Company sold equity mutual funds in 2013 , which were previously impaired, and realized gains of $0.4 million .
24090_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	Realized investment gains (losses) are as follows.
24090_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	As noted in the table below, claims, benefits and surrenders increased from $68.3 million in 2014 to $78.9 million in 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	The Company monitors death claims based upon expectations.
24090_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	These values may routinely fluctuate from year to year.
24090_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	We did experience several higher value claims in the life segment in the first quarter of 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	Endowment benefits decreased slightly in 2015 compared to 2014 amounts.
24090_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	We have a series of international policies that carry an immediate endowment benefit of an amount selected by the policy owner.
24090_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	These benefits have been popular in the Pacific Rim and Latin America, where the Company has experienced increased interest in our guaranteed products in recent years.
24090_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	Like policy dividends, annual guaranteed endowments are factored into the premium and, as such, the increase has no impact on expected profitability.
24090_16_ITEM7_P48_S3	The Company expects these benefits to continue to increase as this block of business increases and persists.
24090_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Property claims increased 10% to approximately $1.7 million in 2015 compared with the amount reported for 2014 due a slight increase in weather related claims.
24090_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	The Hurricane Issac claims experience in 2013 included $0.5 million of losses within our retention limits.
24090_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	Other policy benefits resulted primarily from interest paid on premium deposits and policy benefit accumulations and increased as these policy liabilities also increased.
24090_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	The change in future policy benefit reserves has decreased in 2015 by 5.9% primarily due to the high surrenders and increased in 2014 by 11.6% due primarily to the current low interest rate environment necessitating higher reserves for policies issued in the last few years due to lower long term yield projections compared to prior assumptions.
24090_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	In addition, we continue to experience growth in new sales of endowment products, which require higher initial reserve levels, than whole life products.
24090_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	Endowment sales totaled approximately $16.4 million , $16.1 million and $14.3 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
24090_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Policyholder dividends have risen at a rate corresponding with the growth rate in new international life insurance premiums.
24090_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	The Company issues long duration participating policies to foreign residents that are expected to pay dividends to policyholders based upon actual experience.
24090_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	Policyholder dividends are factored into the premiums at the time the product is developed and have no impact expected on profitability.
24090_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Commission expense fluctuates in a direct relationship to new and renewal insurance premiums and has decreased 0.9% in 2015 compared to 2014 as first year premium revenues, on which higher commission rates are paid, have decreased.
24090_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	Total general expenses have decreased significantly on a consolidated basis in 2015 due primarily to the tax compliance issue we recognized in 2014 resulting in $10.2 million additional expense for future liabilities recorded.
24090_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	In 2015, we recorded an additional $3.4 million of expense related to this tax compliance issue.
24090_16_ITEM7_P54_S2	In 2014 , we also settled litigation in the amount of $0.2 million which was filed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina by the Louisiana Attorney General against all insurers writing homeowner policies in Louisiana.
24090_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	We perform an expense study on an annual basis, utilizing an enterprise-wide time study, and we adjust cost allocations among entities as needed based upon this review.
24090_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	Any allocation changes are reflected in the segment operations, but do not impact total expenses.
24090_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	Capitalized deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") were $31.1 million , $32.1 million and $29.4 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	These costs will vary based upon successful efforts related to newly issued policies and renewal business.
24090_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	Significantly lower amounts are capitalized related to renewal business in correlation with the lower commissions paid on that business compared to first year business which have higher commission rates.
24090_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is impacted by persistency and may fluctuate from year to year.
24090_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	Amortization in 2015 and 2014 increased as we experienced lower persistency in the life segment.
24090_16_ITEM7_P57_S2	In addition, the prolonged low interest rate environment impacted the assumptions used in the development of the DAC asset for new policies issued.
24090_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	Federal income tax expense (benefit) was $1.0 million , $3.7 million and $2.1 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of (37.3)% , (134.0)% and 30.8% , respectively.
24090_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	The changes in rates noted are the result of the tax compliance issue we identified in 2014 which impacted our effective tax rate in 2014 negatively by approximately $3.5 million due to approximately $10.0 million of these costs not being deductible for tax.
24090_16_ITEM7_P58_S2	Additionally, the Company set up a tax expense of $2.1 million for an uncertain tax position that is affecting the 2014 tax rate.
24090_16_ITEM7_P58_S3	The Company began purchasing tax-exempt state and local bonds in the second half of 2011 and continued to do so the last several years in the non-insurance companies where the full tax benefit can be realized.
24090_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	Differences between our effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate result from income and expense items that are treated differently for financial reporting and tax purposes.
24090_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Our business is comprised of three operating business segments, as detailed below.
24090_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	Our insurance operations are the primary focus of the Company, as those segments generate the majority of our income.
24090_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	The amount of insurance, number of policies, and average face amounts of policies issued during the periods indicated are shown below.
24090_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	These segments are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
24090_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	The Company evaluates profit and loss performance based on net income before federal income taxes.
24090_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	Our Life Insurance segment primarily issues ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies in U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents in approximately 30 countries through approximately 1,600 independent marketing consultants, and domestically through over 800 independent marketing firms and consultants throughout the United States.
24090_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	Premium revenues increased for 2015 compared to 2014 and 2013 , due to higher international renewal premiums, which have experienced strong persistency as this block of insurance ages.
24090_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	First year premiums decreased in the current year and may be related to the change in our marketing leadership which happened in October of 2015.
24090_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	Marketing transition takes time but we anticipate that our changes will be positive to the operations overall.
24090_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	Sales from Colombia, Ecuador, Taiwan and Venezuela represented the majority of the premium increase.
24090_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	Life Insurance premium breakout is detailed below.
24090_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	Endowment sales represent a significant portion of new business sales internationally, as these products continue to exceed our whole life sales in the current markets.
24090_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	In addition, most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision, which allows the policyholder to use cash value of a policy to pay premiums.
24090_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	The policy loan asset balance increased 11.4% year over year.
24090_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	The following table sets forth, by country, our direct premiums from our international life insurance business for the periods indicated.
24090_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	Our international business and premium collections could be impacted by future changes relative to laws, regulations or economic events in the countries from which we accept applications.
24090_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	We continue to report strong first year and renewal premiums in our top producing countries as noted above, however this business is dependent on our clients having access to U.S. dollars.
24090_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	Our international business and premium collections could be impacted by future changes relative to laws, regulations or economic events in the countries from which we accept applications as well as, by marketing or operational changes made by the Company.
24090_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	Venezuela is continuing to experience civil unrest due to local demonstrations against crime, corruption and soaring inflation.
24090_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	In addition, there could be law changes in countries that may impact activities of our independent consultants.
24090_16_ITEM7_P71_S2	See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" on pages 7 and 13 for additional information.
24090_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	The following table sets forth our direct premiums by state from our domestic business for the periods indicated.
24090_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	A number of domestic life insurance companies we acquired had blocks of accident and health insurance policies, which we did not consider to be a core part of our business.
24090_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	We have ceded the majority of our accident and health insurance business to an unaffiliated insurance company under a coinsurance agreement.
24090_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	Net investment income has increased as the annual yield has increased 17 basis points in this segment from 2014 , as discussed in the Consolidated Results of Operations above.
24090_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	In 2015 , the Company recognized losses on other-than-temporary impairments totaling $1.9 million related to two bond issuers and $1.9 million on two mutual fund holdings.
24090_16_ITEM7_P75_S1	Realized losses of $0.2 million in 2014 and 2013 were recognized due to the write-down and sale of mutual fund holdings in 2014 and 2013 .

24090_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	Death claims expense increased 25.3% in 2015 compared to 2014 and decreased 3.0% in 2014 compared to 2013 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	We experienced several higher value claims in the first quarter of this year.
24090_16_ITEM7_P77_S2	Mortality experience is closely monitored by the Company as a key performance indicator and these amounts were within expected levels.
24090_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	We noted a significant increase in surrender expense which is primarily related to our international business and is expected to increase over time due to the aging of this block of business.
24090_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	The majority of policy surrender benefits paid is attributable to our international business and was related to policies that have been in force over fifteen years, where surrender charges are no longer applicable.
24090_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	Endowment benefit expense results from the election by policyholders of a product feature that provides an annual benefit.
24090_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	This is a fixed benefit over the life of the contract, and this expense will increase with new sales and improved persistency.
24090_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	Other policy benefits resulted primarily from interest paid on premium deposits and policy benefit accumulations and increased as these policy liabilities also increased.
24090_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	Increase in Future Policy Benefit Reserves .
24090_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	Policy benefit reserves in 2015 decreased compared to the same period in 2014 , primarily as a result of the higher surrenders and lower new sales as noted above.
24090_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	Endowment sales totaled approximately $16.4 million , $16.1 million and $14.3 million , representing approximately 76.1% , 72.7% and 73.1% of total new first year premium in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively.
24090_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	Policyholder dividends have risen at a rate that corresponds with the growth rate in new international life insurance premiums.
24090_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	The Company issues long duration participating policies to foreign residents that are expected to pay dividends to policyholders based upon actual experience.
24090_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	The life company boards approve any dividends on an annual basis and may change the dividend rates as needed for business purposes.
24090_16_ITEM7_P84_S2	Policyholder dividends are factored into the premiums at the time the product is developed and therefore have no impact on expected profitability.
24090_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	Capitalization and Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs .
24090_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	Capitalized costs decreased, as commission related costs have decreased in the current year compared to 2014 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P85_S2	Amortization of DAC increased in the current year by 12.4% from 2014 as we experienced increased lapse activity in the current year.
24090_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	Commission expense increase or decrease is directly related to the increase or decrease in premiums.
24090_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	First year policy premiums pay a higher commission rate than renewal policy premiums.
24090_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	The expenses are allocated by segment, based upon an annual expense study performed by the Company.
24090_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	The 2015 expenses include an additional $4.4 million of increased costs related to the IRC tax compliance issue for life and annuity insurance remediation expense, as well as, consulting costs expenses related to actuarial, tax and legal services related to tax compliance and business analysis initiatives.
24090_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	In 2014 , amounts are higher by $7.9 million as compared to 2013 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P88_S3	This increase is due to the estimated remediation costs of $8.3 million associated with the tax compliance issue we identified.
24090_16_ITEM7_P88_S4	In 2013 , expenses were up from 2012 amounts due to employee health claims, as we are self-insured, and employee costs associated with temporary employees assisting on operations projects that did not reappear in the current year.
24090_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	Our Home Service Insurance segment provides pre-need and final expense ordinary life insurance and annuities to middle and lower income individuals primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	Our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through funeral homes and a home service marketing distribution system utilizing over 620 employees and independent agents.
24090_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	In March of 2014 we completed the acquisition of MGLIC which is a wholly owned subsidiary of SPLIC.
24090_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	MGLIC is licensed in Mississippi and customarily sells policies through independent funeral homes.
24090_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	As part of the conversion process and transitioning policy administration to our computer system, we identified some operational challenges that we are working to improve related to our business processes.
24090_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	The risk profile of this business is higher than the debit based agent collections since the funeral home is the agent and beneficiary to the claims in many cases.
24090_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	We are in the process of incorporating policyholder direct mail and contact within the MGLIC operations to help mitigate risks.
24090_16_ITEM7_P92_S2	We anticipate that our Mississippi clients will experience enhanced support from the affiliated companies and operational benefits.
24090_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	The premiums in this segment increased slightly in 2015 compared to 2014 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P93_S1	Premiums for 2013 do not contain approximately $2.0 million of premiums related to the MGLIC as this acquisition occurred in March of 2014 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	The following table sets forth our direct premiums by state for the periods indicated.
24090_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	The increase in Mississippi for 2015 and 2014 is related to the MGLIC acquisition that occurred in 2014 which is domiciled and licensed in Mississippi.
24090_16_ITEM7_P95_S1	Sales are made by independent funeral home agents.
24090_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	Net investment income has increased as our overall portfolio yield has increased 16 basis points from 2014 yield as discussed in the Consolidated Results of Operations above.
24090_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	MGLIC investment income included 10 months, for the period of ownership during 2014.
24090_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	Net investment income for our home service insurance segment is summarized as follows:
24090_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	Realized Investment Gains (Losses), Net .
24090_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	In 2015 , the Company recognized losses on other-than-temporary impairments totaling $1.1 million related to two bond issuers and $0.5 million on two mutual fund holdings.
24090_16_ITEM7_P99_S1	In 2014 , we recorded net gains of $0.1 million resulting from gains from calls and sales related to bonds of $0.2 million less an OTTI adjustment on mutual funds of $0.1 million.
24090_16_ITEM7_P99_S2	In 2013, we sold two bond mutual fund issues which resulted in a realized loss of $57,000 which was offset by bond gains on calls of $36,000.
24090_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	A breakout of claims and surrender benefits is detailed below.
24090_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	Death claims expense was higher in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily from increased claims liability of $0.6 million as part of the remediation costs associated with the tax compliance issue we identified.
24090_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	This claims liability was released in 2015 due to a refined estimate of our tax compliance issue.
24090_16_ITEM7_P101_S2	In addition, there were more reported claims totaling approximately $0.5 million related to MGLIC that are included in the 2014 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	Mortality experience is closely monitored by the Company as a key performance indicator and these amounts were within expected levels.
24090_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	Surrender expenses are consistent with expectations for the current economic conditions.
24090_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	Property claims increased in 2015 compared to 2014 related to reported weather claims.
24090_16_ITEM7_P104_S1	The Hurricane Issac claims experience in 2013 included $0.5 million of losses within our retention limits.
24090_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	Increase in Future Policy Benefit Reserves .
24090_16_ITEM7_P105_S1	The reserves have increased steadily with the consistent new business pattern.
24090_16_ITEM7_P105_S2	The change in reserves includes estimated reserve changes related to the IRC 7702 tax compliance issue of a decrease of $0.4 million and an increase of $1.4 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
24090_16_ITEM7_P105_S3	These reserves decreased in 2015 due to a more refined estimate.
24090_16_ITEM7_P105_S4	Absent the change in reserves related to the IRC tax issue, the change in reserves between the periods was minimal, excluding MGLIC additional reserves, as premiums were relatively flat and lapse experience was comparable for all three periods presented.
24090_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	The 2014 commission expense, excluding MGLIC amounts of $0.5 million, were comparable for all three periods presented based upon premiums collected.
24090_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	These expenses are allocated by segment based upon an annual expense study performed by the Company.
24090_16_ITEM7_P107_S1	2015 expenses include $0.2 million of estimated charges related to IRC 72s failures on annuities and a reduction of $1.1 million for decreased costs related to IRC 7702 life insurance remediation expense.
24090_16_ITEM7_P107_S2	Additionally, cost increased related to consulting costs for actuarial, tax and legal services related to tax compliance.
24090_16_ITEM7_P107_S3	The 2014 amounts are higher by $2.4 million as compared to 2013 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P107_S4	This increase is due primarily to the estimated remediation costs of $1.9 million associated with the tax compliance issue we identified.
24090_16_ITEM7_P107_S5	In addition, expenses in 2014 increased as MGLIC related expenses are included in this segment in the current year.
24090_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	In 2013, we also settled litigation in the amount of $0.2 million which was filed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina by the Louisiana Attorney General against all insurers writing homeowner policies in Louisiana.
24090_16_ITEM7_P109_S0	Capitalization and Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs ("DAC") .
24090_16_ITEM7_P109_S1	DAC capitalization is directly correlated to fluctuations in first year commissions.
24090_16_ITEM7_P109_S2	Amortization was relatively level, excluding the MGLIC impact in 2014 , as we experienced comparable lapse rates in the three years presented in this segment.
24090_16_ITEM7_P110_S0	We monitor lapse rates as a key component of our insurance operations.
24090_16_ITEM7_P111_S0	This segment represents the administrative support entities to the insurance operations whose revenues are primarily intercompany and have been eliminated in consolidation under GAAP, which typically results in a segment loss.
24090_16_ITEM7_P112_S0	Financial stability and the prevention of capital erosion are important investment considerations for the Company.
24090_16_ITEM7_P113_S0	A primary investment goal is the conservation of assets due to the long-term nature of a significant portion of our liabilities.
24090_16_ITEM7_P113_S1	The administration of our investment portfolios is handled internally, pursuant to board-approved investment guidelines, with all trading activity approved by a committee of each entity s respective board of directors.
24090_16_ITEM7_P113_S2	The guidelines used require that securities are of high quality and investment grade.
24090_16_ITEM7_P114_S0	State insurance statutes prescribe the quality and percentage of the various types of investments that may be made by insurance companies and generally permit investment in qualified state, municipal, federal and foreign government obligations, high quality corporate bonds, preferred and common stock, mortgage loans and real estate within certain specified percentages.
24090_16_ITEM7_P114_S1	The assets selected are intended to mature in accordance with the average maturity of the insurance products and to provide the cash flow for our insurance company subsidiaries to meet their respective policyholder obligations.
24090_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	The following table shows the carrying value of our investments by investment category and cash and cash equivalents, and the percentage of each to total invested assets.
24090_16_ITEM7_P116_S0	(1) Includes $2.6 million and $3.2 million of U.S. Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprise for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
24090_16_ITEM7_P116_S1	(2) Includes $273.1 million and $272.0 million of securities guaranteed by third parties for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
24090_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	The current year decline in U.S. government-sponsored securities is due to call activity from this sector and reinvestment into fixed maturity corporate and municipal bond categories.
24090_16_ITEM7_P117_S1	The Company has increased investments in municipals primarily related to Build America taxable bonds, essential services and corporate issuer holdings in the utility sector.
24090_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	At December 31, 2015 , investments in fixed maturity and equity securities were 87.0% of our total cash, cash equivalents and investments.
24090_16_ITEM7_P118_S1	All of our fixed maturities were classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P118_S2	We had no fixed maturity or equity securities that were classified as trading securities at December 31, 2015 or 2014 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P119_S0	As previously discussed, our investment portfolios have been impacted significantly by the low interest rate environment over the past several years.
24090_16_ITEM7_P119_S1	The following table shows investment yields by segment operations as of December 31 for each year presented.
24090_16_ITEM7_P120_S0	Yields on investment assets vary between segment operations due to different portfolio mixes and durations in the segments.
24090_16_ITEM7_P120_S1	The life segment previously invested more in U.S. Government securities, however over the past few years it has invested in municipal and corporate issuers and is now more similar to the home service segment which has had concentrations primarily in the municipal and corporate sectors.
24090_16_ITEM7_P121_S0	Credit ratings reported for the periods indicated are assigned by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ("NRSRO") such as Moody s Investors Service, Standard Poor s and Fitch Ratings.
24090_16_ITEM7_P121_S1	A credit rating assigned by a NRSRO is a quality based rating, with AAA representing the highest quality and D the lowest, with BBB and above being considered investment grade.
24090_16_ITEM7_P121_S2	In addition, the Company may use credit ratings of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") Securities Valuation Office ("SVO") as assigned, if there is no NRSRO rating.
24090_16_ITEM7_P121_S3	Securities rated by the SVO are grouped in the equivalent NRSRO category as stated by the SVO and securities that are not rated by a NRSRO are included in the "other" category.
24090_16_ITEM7_P122_S0	The following table shows the distribution of the credit ratings of our portfolio of fixed maturity securities by carrying value.
24090_16_ITEM7_P123_S0	The Company made new investments in municipals and corporate bonds, primarily public utility issuers.
24090_16_ITEM7_P124_S0	Non-investment grade securities are the result of downgrades of issuers or securities acquired during acquisitions of companies, as the Company does not purchase below investment grade securities.
24090_16_ITEM7_P125_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company held municipal securities that include third party guarantees.
24090_16_ITEM7_P125_S1	Detailed below is a presentation by NRSRO rating of our municipal holdings by funding type.
24090_16_ITEM7_P126_S0	The Company held investments in special revenue bonds that were greater than 10% of fair value based upon activity as of December 31, 2015 , as shown in the table below.
24090_16_ITEM7_P127_S0	The tables below represent the Company s detailed exposure of municipal holdings in Louisiana, Texas and Florida, which comprise the most significant state concentrations of the total municipal portfolio as of December 31, 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P128_S0	The Company invests in municipal securities of issuers in the state of Louisiana and receives a credit that reduces its premium tax liability in that state.
24090_16_ITEM7_P128_S1	At December 31, 2015 , total holdings of municipal securities in Louisiana represented 6.7% of all municipal holdings based upon fair value.
24090_16_ITEM7_P129_S0	The Company also holds 24.7% of its municipal holdings in Texas issuers.
24090_16_ITEM7_P130_S0	The Company also holds 11.2% of its municipal holdings in Florida issuers.
24090_16_ITEM7_P131_S0	There were no other states or individual issuer holdings that represented or exceeded 10% of the total municipal portfolio as of December 31, 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P132_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of our fixed maturity and equity securities at least quarterly.
24090_16_ITEM7_P133_S0	The Company monitors all debt and equity securities on an on-going basis relative to changes in credit ratings, market prices, earnings trends and financial performance, in addition to specific region or industry reviews.
24090_16_ITEM7_P134_S0	The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on a case-by-case evaluation of underlying reasons for the decline in fair value.
24090_16_ITEM7_P135_S0	The Company determines other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) by reviewing all relevant evidence related to the specific security issuer as well as the Company's intent to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost.
24090_16_ITEM7_P136_S0	When an OTTI has occurred, the amount of the OTTI recognized in earnings depends on whether the Company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis.
24090_16_ITEM7_P136_S1	If the Company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, an OTTI is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_16_ITEM7_P136_S2	If the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Company is required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the OTTI will be separated into the following: a) the amount representing the credit loss; and b) the amount related to all other factors.
24090_16_ITEM7_P136_S3	The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings.
24090_16_ITEM7_P136_S4	The amount of the total OTTI related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_16_ITEM7_P136_S5	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_16_ITEM7_P136_S6	The new amortized cost is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value.
24090_16_ITEM7_P137_S0	We recorded a write-down in 2015 related to impairments on two bond mutual funds totaling $2.4 million and impairments on two bond issuers totaling $3.0 million related to a utility and energy issuer.
24090_16_ITEM7_P137_S1	In 2014, impairments of $0.4 million were recorded as a result of our OTTI analysis.
24090_16_ITEM7_P137_S2	There were no OTTI impairments recorded during 2013.
24090_16_ITEM7_P137_S3	Based upon our analysis of whether declines in fair value below cost are temporary or other-than-temporary, management believes that our investments in fixed maturity investments at December 31, 2015 were not impaired, and no additional other-than-temporary losses need to be recorded.
24090_16_ITEM7_P138_S0	Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities available-for-sale amounted to $7.9 million as of December 31, 2015 and $2.5 million as of December 31, 2014 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P138_S1	This increase in gross unrealized losses was due to an increase in the interest rate environment in 2015.
24090_16_ITEM7_P138_S2	There were $0.6 million and $0.9 million of gross unrealized losses on equity securities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P139_S0	As is customary among insurance companies, our insurance company subsidiaries reinsure with other companies portions of the life insurance risks they underwrite.
24090_16_ITEM7_P139_S1	A primary purpose of reinsurance agreements is to enable an insurance company to reduce the amount of risk on any particular life and, by reinsuring the amount exceeding the maximum amount the insurance company is willing to retain, to insure individuals in amounts larger than it could without such agreements.
24090_16_ITEM7_P139_S2	Even though a portion of the risk may be reinsured, our insurance company subsidiaries remain liable to perform all the obligations imposed by the policies issued by them and could be liable if their reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements.
24090_16_ITEM7_P140_S0	We believe we have established appropriate reinsurance coverage based upon our net retained insured liabilities compared to our surplus.
24090_16_ITEM7_P141_S0	The effect of reinsurance on premiums is as follows.
24090_16_ITEM7_P142_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries monitor the solvency of their reinsurers in seeking to minimize the risk of loss in the event of default by a reinsurer.
24090_16_ITEM7_P143_S0	The primary reinsurers of our insurance subsidiaries are large, well-capitalized entities.
24090_16_ITEM7_P144_S0	The effect of reinsurance on life insurance in force is as follows.
24090_16_ITEM7_P145_S0	Virtually all of the Company's non-credit accident and health insurance has been reinsured and is administered by Unified Life Insurance Company, an unaffiliated party.
24090_16_ITEM7_P145_S1	The reinsurance recoverables under this agreement are collateralized by assets held in a trust for the benefit of the reinsured policies.
24090_16_ITEM7_P146_S0	The Company monitors the credit ratings of our life and property reinsurers.
24090_16_ITEM7_P146_S1	The ratings by A.M. Best Company range from B+ (Good) to A+ (Superior).
24090_16_ITEM7_P147_S0	SPFIC has first and second event catastrophe reinsurance coverage of $10.0 million per event and a retention level of $500,000 per event.
24090_16_ITEM7_P147_S1	Thus, the first $500,000 of incurred claims and any claims in excess of $10.0 million are SPFIC's responsibility.
24090_16_ITEM7_P148_S0	The reinsurance premium for first event catastrophe reinsurance was $873,000 , $967,000 and $1,107,000 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
24090_16_ITEM7_P149_S0	Liquidity refers to a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the needs of its operations.
24090_16_ITEM7_P149_S1	Liquidity is managed on insurance operations to ensure stable and reliable sources of cash flows to meet obligations and is provided by a variety of sources.
24090_16_ITEM7_P150_S0	Our liquidity requirements are met primarily by funds provided from operations.
24090_16_ITEM7_P150_S1	Premium deposits and revenues, investment income and investment maturities are the primary sources of funds, while investment purchases, policy benefits, and operating expenses are the primary uses of funds.
24090_16_ITEM7_P150_S2	We historically have not had to liquidate investments to provide cash flow, and there were no liquidity issues in 2015 or 2014 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P150_S3	Our investments consist of 67.6% of marketable debt securities and 2.2% of equity securities classified as available-for-sale that could be readily converted to cash for liquidity needs.
24090_16_ITEM7_P151_S0	A primary liquidity concern is the risk of an extraordinary level of early policyholder withdrawals.
24090_16_ITEM7_P151_S1	We include provisions within our insurance policies, such as surrender charges, that help limit and discourage early withdrawals.
24090_16_ITEM7_P151_S2	Since these contractual withdrawals, as well as the level of surrenders experienced, have been largely consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management, our associated cash outflows have, historically, not had an adverse impact on our overall liquidity.
24090_16_ITEM7_P152_S0	Individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy.
24090_16_ITEM7_P152_S1	Cash flow projections and cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios are also performed annually to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy.
24090_16_ITEM7_P153_S0	We currently anticipate that available liquidity sources and future cash flows will be adequate to meet our needs for funds.
24090_16_ITEM7_P154_S0	Cash flows from our insurance operations historically have been sufficient to meet current needs.
24090_16_ITEM7_P154_S1	Cash flows from operating activities were $87.2 million , $97.9 million and $81.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
24090_16_ITEM7_P154_S2	We have traditionally also had significant cash flows from both scheduled and unscheduled fixed maturity security calls, maturities, redemptions, and prepayments, which totaled $95.6 million , $71.4 million and $92.7 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P154_S3	These cash flows, for the most part, are reinvested in fixed income securities.
24090_16_ITEM7_P154_S4	Net cash outflows from investment activity totaled $58.0 million , $104.0 million and $84.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
24090_16_ITEM7_P154_S5	The outflows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 , primarily related to the investment of excess cash and cash equivalents generated from operations during 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P154_S6	The Company's cash flows from financing activities were $3.0 million in 2015 , $2.1 million in 2014 and $1.7 million in 2013 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P155_S0	See "Parent Company Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for a discussion of additional Parent Company liquidity.
24090_16_ITEM7_P156_S0	In 2015, we determined that a portion of the life insurance and annuity policies issued by our subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702 and 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") of 1986.
24090_16_ITEM7_P156_S1	As a result, we have established a liability reserve of $ 14.6 million, net of tax for probable liabilities and expenses associated with this tax compliance matter, which represents management s estimate and we have disclosed an estimated range related to probable liabilities and expenses of $9.0 million to $45.5 million , net of tax.
24090_16_ITEM7_P156_S2	This estimate and range includes projected toll charges and fees payable to the IRS, as well as estimated increased payout obligations to current and former holders of non-compliant domestic life insurance policies expected to result from remediation of those policies.
24090_16_ITEM7_P156_S3	The amount of our liabilities and expenses depends on a number of uncertainties, including the number of prior tax years for which we may be liable to the IRS, the number of domestic life insurance policies we will be required to remediate, and the methodology applicable to the calculation of taxable benefits under non-compliant policies.
24090_16_ITEM7_P156_S4	Given the range of potential outcomes and the significant variables assumed in establishing our estimates, actual amounts incurred may exceed our reserve and also could exceed the high end of our estimated range of liabilities and expenses.
24090_16_ITEM7_P157_S0	This tax compliance issue impacts our policyholders and their tax liabilities relative to these products that fail 7702 and 72(s) for those that will not be remediated.
24090_16_ITEM7_P158_S0	The exposure related to future sales or products in force is unknown at this time.
24090_16_ITEM7_P159_S0	could decide to surrender their policies due to this issue which would subsequently result in higher cash outflows due to an increase in surrender activity.
24090_16_ITEM7_P160_S0	The NAIC has established minimum capital requirements in the form of RBC.
24090_16_ITEM7_P160_S1	RBC considers the type of business written by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company's business to develop a minimum level of capital called "Authorized Control Level Risk-based Capital" and compares this level to an adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves.
24090_16_ITEM7_P160_S2	Should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk-based capital fall below 200%, a series of remedial actions by the affected company would be required.
24090_16_ITEM7_P161_S0	At December 31, 2015 , all of our insurance subsidiaries were above the required minimum RBC levels.
24090_16_ITEM7_P162_S0	In 2013, CICA contributed 50,000 shares of Citizens, Inc.
24090_16_ITEM7_P162_S1	Class A common stock to CNLIC as a capital contribution due to minimum capital and surplus considerations.
24090_16_ITEM7_P162_S2	The contributed shares had a fair market contributed value of and $0.4 million .
24090_16_ITEM7_P162_S3	These shares were subsequently purchased by Citizens, Inc., the ultimate parent, for $0.4 million cash in 2013.
24090_16_ITEM7_P163_S0	We have committed to the following contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 , with the payments due by the period indicated below:
24090_16_ITEM7_P164_S0	The payments related to the future policy benefits and policy claims payable reflected in the table above have been projected utilizing assumptions based upon our historical experience and anticipated future experience.
24090_16_ITEM7_P165_S0	The Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2015 and, therefore, does not expect any future effects on the Company's financial condition related to any such arrangements.
24090_16_ITEM7_P166_S0	We do not utilize special purpose entities as investment vehicles, nor are there any such entities in which we have an investment that engages in speculative activities of any nature, and we do not use such investments to hedge our investment positions.
24090_16_ITEM7_P167_S0	Citizens is a holding company and has had minimal operations of its own.
24090_16_ITEM7_P167_S1	Our assets consist of the capital stock of our subsidiaries, cash, fixed income securities, mutual funds and investment real estate.
24090_16_ITEM7_P167_S2	Our cash flows depend primarily upon the availability of statutorily permissible payments, primarily payments under management agreements from our two primary life insurance subsidiaries, CICA and SPLIC.
24090_16_ITEM7_P167_S3	The ability to make payments is limited by applicable laws and regulations of Colorado, CICA's state of domicile, and Louisiana, SPLIC's state of domicile, which subject insurance operations to significant regulatory restrictions.
24090_16_ITEM7_P167_S4	These laws and regulations require, among other things, that these insurance subsidiaries maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company.
24090_16_ITEM7_P168_S0	We historically have not relied upon dividends from subsidiaries for our cash flow needs.
24090_16_ITEM7_P168_S1	However, CICA and SPLIC both dividend available funds from time to time in relation to new acquisition target strategies.
24090_16_ITEM7_P169_S0	As of December 31, 2015, Citizens had fixed maturities available for sale of $54.2 million and cash of $15.8 million, which represents additional liquidity for future acquisitions, liquidity support for the life insurance companies and for general corporate purposes.
24090_16_ITEM7_P170_S0	Additionally, a substantial portion of our international policyholders invest their policy cash dividends and benefits in our Class A common stock through our Stock Investment Plan (the Plan ).
24090_16_ITEM7_P170_S1	Once a policyholder elects to participate in the Plan, their policy benefits can be used to purchase Citizens Class A common stock through the Plan in the open market.
24090_16_ITEM7_P170_S2	In addition, our existing holders of Class A common stock, our employees and our independent consultants are eligible to participate in the Plan.
24090_16_ITEM7_P170_S3	If fewer policyholders elect to participate in the Plan, or if our international premium collections were to decrease as a result of regulatory or marketing impediments, the trading volume of our Class A common stock may decline from its present levels.
24090_16_ITEM7_P171_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
24090_16_ITEM7_P171_S1	Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM7_P171_S2	While we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available.
24090_16_ITEM7_P171_S3	Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
24090_16_ITEM7_P172_S0	Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.
24090_16_ITEM7_P173_S0	No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting policies.
24090_16_ITEM7_P174_S0	Our critical accounting policies are as follows:
24090_16_ITEM7_P175_S0	Future policy benefit reserves have been computed by the net level premium method with assumptions as to investment yields, dividends on participating business, mortality and withdrawals based upon our experience.
24090_16_ITEM7_P175_S1	The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of policy liabilities and the increase in future policy benefit reserves.
24090_16_ITEM7_P175_S2	Management's judgments and estimates for future policy benefit reserves provide for possible unfavorable deviation.
24090_16_ITEM7_P176_S0	We continue to use the original assumptions (including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation) in subsequent periods to determine the changes in the liability for future policy benefits (the "lock-in concept ) unless a premium deficiency exists.
24090_16_ITEM7_P176_S1	Management monitors these assumptions and has determined that a premium deficiency did not exist as of December 31, 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P176_S2	Management believes that our policy liabilities and increase in future policy benefit reserves as of the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 are based upon assumptions, including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation, that do not warrant revision.
24090_16_ITEM7_P177_S0	Acquisition costs, consisting of commissions and policy issuance, underwriting and agency expenses that relate to and vary with the successful production of new business, are deferred.
24090_16_ITEM7_P177_S1	These deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized primarily over the estimated profits, using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_16_ITEM7_P178_S0	We utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance.
24090_16_ITEM7_P178_S1	The factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period.
24090_16_ITEM7_P178_S2	The factor method ensures that policies which lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation.
24090_16_ITEM7_P178_S3	The factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value, provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors.
24090_16_ITEM7_P179_S0	Inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred, the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_16_ITEM7_P179_S1	Approximately 94.0% of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year excess commissions.
24090_16_ITEM7_P179_S2	The remaining 6.0% are attributed to costs that vary with and are directly related to the successful acquisition of new insurance business.
24090_16_ITEM7_P179_S3	Those costs generally include costs related to the production, underwriting and issuance of new business.
24090_16_ITEM7_P180_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_16_ITEM7_P180_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 30 years.
24090_16_ITEM7_P180_S2	The available premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated.
24090_16_ITEM7_P180_S3	The deferred policy acquisition costs are then evaluated over two methods utilizing reasonable assumptions and two other methods using pessimistic assumptions.
24090_16_ITEM7_P180_S4	The two methods using reasonable assumptions illustrate an early-deferred policy acquisition recoverability period.
24090_16_ITEM7_P180_S5	The two methods utilizing pessimistic assumptions still support early recoverability of our aggregate deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_16_ITEM7_P181_S0	Management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value.
24090_16_ITEM7_P181_S1	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on capitalized expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business, utilization of the factor method and annual recoverability testing.
24090_16_ITEM7_P182_S0	Cost of Customer Relationships Acquired ("CCRA") is established when we purchase a block of insurance.
24090_16_ITEM7_P182_S1	CCRA is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_16_ITEM7_P183_S0	We utilize various methods to determine the amount of the ending asset balance, including a static model and a dynamic model.
24090_16_ITEM7_P183_S1	Inherent in the amortization of CCRA are certain management judgments about the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_16_ITEM7_P183_S2	The assumptions used are based upon interest, mortality and lapses at the time of purchase.
24090_16_ITEM7_P184_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_16_ITEM7_P184_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next thirty years.
24090_16_ITEM7_P184_S2	The CCRA is then evaluated utilizing reasonable assumptions.
24090_16_ITEM7_P184_S3	Management believes our CCRA and related amortization is recoverable for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
24090_16_ITEM7_P184_S4	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on estimated future results of the block and our annual recoverability testing.
24090_16_ITEM7_P185_S0	Current accounting guidance requires that goodwill balances be reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event has occurred.
24090_16_ITEM7_P186_S0	A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment on one level below an operating segment.
24090_16_ITEM7_P186_S1	Most of the Company's reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated, are equivalent to the Company's operating segment, as there is no discrete financial information available for the separate components of the segment or all of the components of the segment have similar economic characteristics.
24090_16_ITEM7_P187_S0	The goodwill impairment test follows a multi-step process as defined under current accounting guidance.
24090_16_ITEM7_P187_S1	An initial review may be performed whereby the assessment is based upon qualitative factors before performing the first test step.
24090_16_ITEM7_P188_S0	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
24090_16_ITEM7_P188_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment.
24090_16_ITEM7_P188_S2	In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value.
24090_16_ITEM7_P189_S0	carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
24090_16_ITEM7_P190_S0	Management's determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations, peer company price to earnings multiples, the level of the Company's Class A common stock price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit.
24090_16_ITEM7_P190_S1	Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections.
24090_16_ITEM7_P191_S0	The evaluation of securities for impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings.
24090_16_ITEM7_P191_S1	The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition or future prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period.
24090_16_ITEM7_P192_S0	Based upon current accounting guidance, investment securities must be classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading.
24090_16_ITEM7_P192_S1	Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase.
24090_16_ITEM7_P193_S0	The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities.
24090_16_ITEM7_P193_S1	Fixed maturity securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the Company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity.
24090_16_ITEM7_P193_S2	Securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings until realized.
24090_16_ITEM7_P194_S0	The Company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if an OTTI exists pursuant to the accounting guidelines.
24090_16_ITEM7_P194_S1	In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the ability and intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
24090_16_ITEM7_P194_S2	In analyzing an issuer's financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the Federal government or its agencies, by government-sponsored agencies, or whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and reviews of the issuer's financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM7_P195_S0	If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, management must then determine the amount of OTTI to be recognized in earnings.
24090_16_ITEM7_P195_S1	If management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.
24090_16_ITEM7_P195_S2	The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.
24090_16_ITEM7_P195_S3	The amount of OTTI related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_16_ITEM7_P195_S4	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_16_ITEM7_P195_S5	If management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_16_ITEM7_P195_S6	Any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain (as other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold.
24090_16_ITEM7_P196_S0	The Company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions, future market movements, business plan changes, or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time.
24090_16_ITEM7_P197_S0	Premiums on life and accident and health policies are reported as earned when due or, for short duration contracts, over the contract period on a pro rata basis.
24090_16_ITEM7_P197_S1	Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in recognition of profits over the estimated life of the contracts.
24090_16_ITEM7_P197_S2	This matching is accomplished by means of provisions for future benefits and the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_16_ITEM7_P198_S0	Annuities are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest bearing financial instruments.
24090_16_ITEM7_P199_S0	Our primary annuity products do not include fees or other such charges.
24090_16_ITEM7_P200_S0	A deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recorded only if a determination is made that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax treatment on which the deferred tax item depends will be sustained in the event of an audit.
24090_16_ITEM7_P200_S1	These determinations inherently involve management's judgment.
24090_16_ITEM7_P200_S2	In addition, the Company must record a tax valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
24090_16_ITEM7_P200_S3	This valuation allowance is in essence a contra account to the deferred tax asset.
24090_16_ITEM7_P200_S4	Management must determine the portion of the deferred tax asset and resulting tax benefit that may not be realized based upon judgment of expected outcomes.
24090_16_ITEM7_P201_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_16_ITEM7_P201_S1	Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position.
24090_16_ITEM7_P202_S0	An estimated loss from a contingency is accrued and charged to results of operations only if both of the following conditions are met:
24090_16_ITEM7_P203_S0	Information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable (virtual certainty is not required) that an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred as of the date of the financial statements; and 2.
24090_16_ITEM7_P203_S1	The amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
24090_16_ITEM7_P204_S0	Reasonable estimation of a possible loss does not require estimating a single amount of the loss.
24090_16_ITEM7_P204_S1	It requires that a loss be accrued if it can be estimated within a range.
24090_16_ITEM7_P204_S2	If an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, that amount is accrued.
24090_16_ITEM7_P204_S3	If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
24090_16_ITEM7_P205_S0	A gain contingency is an uncertain situation that will be resolved in the future, possibly resulting in a gain.
24090_16_ITEM7_P205_S1	We do not allow the recognition of a gain contingency prior to settlement of the underlying event.
24090_16_ITEM7_P205_S2	If we were to have a gain contingency, we would disclose it in the notes to the financial statements.
24090_16_ITEM7_P206_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The nature of our business exposes us to market risk relative to our invested assets and policy liabilities.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Market risk is the risk of loss that may occur when changes in interest rates and public equity prices adversely affect the value of our invested assets.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Interest rate risk is our primary market risk exposure.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can affect the fair value of our investments.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio generally increases when interest rates decrease and decreases when interest rates increase.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The following table summarizes net unrealized gains and losses as of the dates indicated.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our exposure to interest rate changes results from our significant holdings of fixed maturity investments, policy loans and mortgage loans on real estate, all of which comprised over 90.2% of our cash and investment portfolio as of December 31, 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	These investments are mainly exposed to changes in U.S. Treasury rates.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Our fixed maturities investments include U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, U.S. Government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, state and municipal bonds, and corporate bonds.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Approximately 72.5% of the fixed maturities we owned at market value on December 31, 2015 are state and political subdivisions which are primarily municipal holdings.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P2_S4	These holdings are diversified over several states.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Changes in interest rates typically have a sizable effect on the fair value of our debt and equities securities.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The interest rate of the ten-year U.S. Treasury bond increased to 2.27% during the year ended 2015, from 2.17% at December 31, 2014 .
24090_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities totaled $26.5 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $47.2 million at December 31, 2014.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	To manage interest risk, we perform periodic projections of asset and liability cash flows to evaluate the potential sensitivity of our investments and liabilities.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	We assess interest rate sensitivity on an annual basis with respect to our fixed maturities investments using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward shifts in the prevailing interest rates.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The Company performed an analysis of fair value changes using assumed 100 basis point upward shifts in interest rates, noting that the fair value of our fixed maturity investment portfolio of $1.0 billion would decrease approximately $50.2 million to a fair value of $950.4 million upon a 100 basis point increase.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The following table shows the effects on the fair values of our fixed maturity investments based upon these scenarios.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	While the test scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed-income markets, it is a near-term change that illustrates the potential impact of such events.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Due to the composition of our book of insurance business, we believe it is unlikely we would encounter large surrender activity due to an interest rate increase that would force us to dispose of our fixed maturities at a loss.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Our fixed maturity portfolio is exposed to call risk as a significant portion of the current holdings are callable.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P8_S1	A decreasing interest rate environment can result in increased call activity as experienced over the past several years, and an increasing rate environment will likely result in securities being paid at their stated maturity.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P9_S0	There are no fixed maturities or other investments that we classify as trading instruments.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Approximately 73.5% of fixed maturities were held in available-for-sale and 26.5% in held-to-maturity based upon fair value at December 31, 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM7A_P9_S2	At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had no investments in derivative instruments, subprime loans or CDOs (collateralized debt obligations).
24090_16_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Changes in the level or volatility of equity prices affect the value of equity securities we hold as investments.
24090_16_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Our equity investments portfolio represented 2.2% of our total investments at December 31, 2015 , with 91.9% invested in diversified equity and bond mutual funds.
24090_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	Reference is made to the financial statements, the notes thereto, and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm, as listed on the table of contents.
24090_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	All other schedules have been omitted as the required information is inapplicable or the information required is presented in the financial statements or the notes thereto filed elsewhere herein.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure, among other things, material information relating to our Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to our officers who certify our financial reports and to the other members of our senior management and the Board of Directors.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and our Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") are responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")).
24090_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based upon an evaluation at the end of the period, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, in light of the material weakness described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management of our Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Management assessed internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 Framework ("COSO").
24090_16_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on that assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 was not effective due to the material weakness described below.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	As of December 31, 2015, we became aware of an ineffective management review control as it pertains to our tax review of external tax experts complex documentation.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Specifically, this documentation included the tax rollforward schedule that reconciles deferred taxes, uncertain tax position computations, life/non-life qualification tests and overall income tax expense recorded in the financial statements of the Company, all of which had some added complexity due to our IRC 7702 and 72(s) tax compliance issues.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Although there is increased complexity of the tax documentation, management is responsible for the accuracy of the financial statements.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Because of this ineffective management review control, there was a reasonable possibility that the Company s annual financial statements would have been filed containing a material misstatement.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P3_S4	Management concludes there is a material weakness in this management review control.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P3_S5	Management has begun documenting its remediation steps and strategy.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P4_S1	The report is included in item 9A(c) of this annual report.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries: We have audited Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
24090_16_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting .
24090_16_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
24090_16_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P6_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P7_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P9_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P10_S0	provision and related current payable and deferred income tax balances.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P10_S1	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2015 consolidated financial statements.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P10_S2	This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2015 financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 24, 2016 , which expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P11_S0	In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P12_S0	As previously discussed, as of December 31, 2015, management detected an ineffective management review control as it pertains to our tax review of external tax experts complex documentation.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P12_S1	This has resulted in a change in internal control over financial reporting during the current period.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P12_S2	The Company did not have adequately designed and documented management review controls over the third party prepared tax documentation.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P12_S3	Specifically, the management review controls did not adequately address management s expectations, criteria for investigation, and the level of precision used in the performance of the review controls, resulting in a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P12_S4	Management has begun documenting its remediation steps and strategy.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P13_S0	As reported as of December 31, 2014, management became aware of an ineffective executive management review control as it pertains to our actuarial function that was relied upon by management.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P13_S1	Due to the nature of the failure, management believed this was an entity level control failure related to personnel competency and a lack of appropriate sensitivity and precision in executive management s review of the actuarial function.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P14_S0	The material weakness related to the sensitivity and precision of management s review control over the actuarial function is assessed by management to have been fully remediated as of December 31, 2015.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P15_S0	Remediation of the material weakness identified deficiency related to personnel competency in the actuarial function is assessed by management to be ongoing as of December 31, 2015.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P15_S1	However, in consideration of the changes and enhancements made to actuarial staff and support and the effective entity level controls, management does not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis related to this deficiency.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P15_S2	Therefore management assesses the identified deficiency related to personnel competency in the actuarial function as a significant deficiency, which is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the Company's financial reporting.
24090_16_ITEM9A_P16_S0	There were no other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
24090_16_ITEM9B_P0_S0	Items 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of this Report incorporate by reference the information in our definitive proxy material under the headings "Election of Directors and Executive Officers," "Executive Officer and Director Compensation," "Stock and Principal Stockholders," "Control of the Company," and "Principal Accounting Fees and Services," to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 120 days after December 31, 2015 .

24090_16_ITEM15_P2_S2	These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management.
24090_16_ITEM15_P2_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.
24090_16_ITEM15_P3_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
24090_16_ITEM15_P3_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
24090_16_ITEM15_P4_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
24090_16_ITEM15_P4_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
24090_16_ITEM15_P4_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
24090_16_ITEM15_P5_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
24090_16_ITEM15_P5_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
24090_16_ITEM15_P6_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Citizens Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 24, 2016 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.

24090_16_ITEM15_P13_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Citizens, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP").
24090_16_ITEM15_P14_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of Citizens, Inc. ("Citizens"), a Colorado corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, CICA Life Insurance Company of America ("CICA"), Citizens National Life Insurance Company ("CNLIC"), Security Plan Life Insurance Company ("SPLIC"), Security Plan Fire Insurance Company ("SPFIC"), Magnolia Guaranty Life Insurance Company ("MGLIC"), Computing Technology, Inc. ("CTI"), and Insurance Investors, Inc. ("III").
24090_16_ITEM15_P14_S1	All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
24090_16_ITEM15_P15_S0	In accordance with our purchase agreement dated October 7, 2013, we finalized the MGLIC stock acquisition on March 7, 2014 for approximately $5.2 million in cash consideration.
24090_16_ITEM15_P15_S1	The assets recorded as of acquisition were $12.0 million , liabilities of $ 6.8 million and stockholders equity of $5.2 million .
24090_16_ITEM15_P15_S2	We recorded goodwill of $0.1 million related to this purchase.
24090_16_ITEM15_P15_S3	This entity is reported as part of our home service segment and is a wholly owned subsidiary of SPLIC.
24090_16_ITEM15_P16_S0	We provide primarily life insurance and endowments, as well as a small amount of health insurance policies, through four of our subsidiaries - CICA, SPLIC, MGLIC and CNLIC.
24090_16_ITEM15_P17_S0	CICA and CNLIC issue ordinary whole-life policies, burial insurance, pre-need policies, and accident and health related policies throughout the Midwest and southern United States.
24090_16_ITEM15_P17_S1	CICA also issues ordinary whole-life and endowment policies to non-U.S. residents.
24090_16_ITEM15_P18_S0	SPLIC and MGLIC offer final expense and industrial life insurance in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, and SPFIC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SPLIC, writes a limited amount of property insurance in Louisiana.
24090_16_ITEM15_P19_S0	CTI provides data processing systems and services, as well as furniture and equipment, to the Company.
24090_16_ITEM15_P20_S0	III provides aviation transportation to the Company.
24090_16_ITEM15_P21_S0	Investment securities are classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading.
24090_16_ITEM15_P21_S1	Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase.
24090_16_ITEM15_P22_S0	The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities.
24090_16_ITEM15_P22_S1	Fixed maturity securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the Company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity.
24090_16_ITEM15_P22_S2	Securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings until realized.
24090_16_ITEM15_P23_S0	Fixed maturities consist primarily of bonds classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.
24090_16_ITEM15_P23_S1	The Company does not classify any fixed maturities as trading.
24090_16_ITEM15_P23_S2	Equity securities (including non-redeemable preferred stock) are considered available-for-sale and are reported at fair value.
24090_16_ITEM15_P24_S0	Unrealized gain (loss) of equity securities and fixed maturities held as available-for-sale is shown as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of tax, and is a separate component of comprehensive income.
24090_16_ITEM15_P25_S0	The Company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if an other-than-temporary impairment ("OTTI") exists pursuant to the accounting guidelines.
24090_16_ITEM15_P25_S1	In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the ability and intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
24090_16_ITEM15_P25_S2	In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the Federal government or its agencies, by government-sponsored agencies, or whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and reviews of the issuer s financial condition.
24090_16_ITEM15_P26_S0	If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, management must then determine the amount of OTTI to be recognized in earnings.
24090_16_ITEM15_P26_S1	If management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.
24090_16_ITEM15_P26_S2	The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.
24090_16_ITEM15_P26_S3	The amount of OTTI related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_16_ITEM15_P26_S4	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_16_ITEM15_P26_S5	If management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_16_ITEM15_P26_S6	Any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain (as other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold.
24090_16_ITEM15_P27_S0	The Company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions, future market movements, business plan changes, or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time.
24090_16_ITEM15_P28_S0	Mortgage loans on real estate and policy loans are reported at unpaid principal balances.
24090_16_ITEM15_P29_S0	Real estate and other long-term investments consist primarily of land and buildings that are recorded at depreciated cost.
24090_16_ITEM15_P29_S1	If the fair value of the real estate is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized and charged to earnings.
24090_16_ITEM15_P30_S0	Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method.
24090_16_ITEM15_P31_S0	Dividend and interest income is recognized when earned.
24090_16_ITEM15_P31_S1	Realized gains and losses are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold.
24090_16_ITEM15_P32_S0	The Company had cash equivalents, fixed maturities and equity securities with an aggregate fair value of 10.2 million and $10.3 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, on deposit with various state regulatory authorities to fulfill statutory requirements.
24090_16_ITEM15_P33_S0	Premiums on life policies are recognized as earned when due.
24090_16_ITEM15_P33_S1	Due premiums on the balance sheet are net of allowances.
24090_16_ITEM15_P34_S0	Accident and health policies are recognized as revenue over the contract period on a pro rata basis.
24090_16_ITEM15_P34_S1	Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in the recognition of profits over the estimated lives of the contracts.
24090_16_ITEM15_P34_S2	This matching is accomplished by means of a provision for future policy benefits and the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_16_ITEM15_P35_S0	Annuity policies, primarily flexible premium fixed annuity products, are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest bearing financial instruments.
24090_16_ITEM15_P35_S1	Premium receipts are not reported as revenue, rather as deposit liabilities to annuity contracts.
24090_16_ITEM15_P35_S2	The annuity products issued do not include fees or other such charges.
24090_16_ITEM15_P36_S0	Acquisition costs, consisting of commissions and policy issuance, underwriting and agent convention expenses that are primarily related to and vary with the successful production of new and renewal business have been deferred.
24090_16_ITEM15_P36_S1	These deferred amounts, referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC"), are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and amortized to income in a systematic manner, based on related contract revenues or gross profits as appropriate.
24090_16_ITEM15_P37_S0	Traditional life insurance and accident and health insurance acquisition costs are being amortized over the premium-paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing future policy benefit liabilities.
24090_16_ITEM15_P37_S1	For universal life type contracts and investment contracts that include significant surrender charges or that yield significant revenues from sources other than the investment contract holders' funds, the deferred contract acquisition cost amortization is matched to the recognition of gross profit.
24090_16_ITEM15_P37_S2	The effect on the DAC asset that would result from realization of unrealized gains or losses is recognized with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income in consolidated stockholders' equity.
24090_16_ITEM15_P38_S0	substantially changes a contract as defined in current accounting guidance, then the DAC is written off immediately through income and any new deferrable costs associated with the new replacement are deferred.
24090_16_ITEM15_P38_S1	If a contract modification does not substantially change the contract, the DAC amortization on the original contract will continue and any acquisition costs associated with the related modification are immediately expensed.
24090_16_ITEM15_P39_S0	We utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance.
24090_16_ITEM15_P39_S1	The factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period.
24090_16_ITEM15_P39_S2	The factor method ensures that policies lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation.
24090_16_ITEM15_P39_S3	The factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value, provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors.
24090_16_ITEM15_P40_S0	Inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred, the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_16_ITEM15_P40_S1	Approximately 94% of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year and renewal excess commissions.
24090_16_ITEM15_P40_S2	The remaining 6% are attributed to costs that vary with and are directly related to the successful acquisition of new insurance business.
24090_16_ITEM15_P40_S3	Those costs generally include costs related to the production, underwriting and issuance of new business.
24090_16_ITEM15_P41_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_16_ITEM15_P41_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less the benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 30 years.
24090_16_ITEM15_P41_S2	The available premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated.
24090_16_ITEM15_P41_S3	The deferred policy acquisition costs are then evaluated over two methods utilizing reasonable assumptions and two other methods using pessimistic assumptions.
24090_16_ITEM15_P42_S0	Management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value.
24090_16_ITEM15_P42_S1	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on capitalized expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business, utilization of the factor method and annual recoverability testing.
24090_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	The components of deferred acquisition costs from year to year are summarized as follows:
24090_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	Cost of customer relationships acquired ("CCRA") is established when we purchase a block of insurance.
24090_16_ITEM15_P44_S1	CCRA is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_16_ITEM15_P45_S0	We utilize various methods to determine the amount of the ending asset balance, including a static model and a dynamic model.
24090_16_ITEM15_P45_S1	Inherent in the amortization of CCRA are certain management judgments about the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_16_ITEM15_P45_S2	The assumptions used are based upon interest, mortality and lapses at the time of purchase.
24090_16_ITEM15_P46_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_16_ITEM15_P46_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less the benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next thirty years.
24090_16_ITEM15_P46_S2	The CCRA is then evaluated utilizing reasonable assumptions.
24090_16_ITEM15_P47_S0	December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
24090_16_ITEM15_P47_S1	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on estimated future results of the block and our annual recoverability testing.
24090_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	Cost of customer relationships acquired relative to purchased blocks of insurance is summarized as follows:
24090_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	Estimated amortization of cost of customer relationship acquired in each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows.
24090_16_ITEM15_P49_S1	Actual future amortization will differ from these estimates due to variances from estimated future withdrawal assumptions.
24090_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	The value of CCRA in our various acquisitions, which is included in cost of customer relationships acquired in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, was determined based on the present value of future profits discounted at annual rates ranging from 3.7% to 8.5% .
24090_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	Future policy benefit reserves for traditional life insurance and accident and health insurance contract benefits and expenses are computed using a net level premium method, with assumptions as to investment yields, dividends on participating business, mortality and withdrawals based upon our experience, modified as necessary to reflect anticipated trends and to include provisions for possible unfavorable deviations.
24090_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	The accrued account balance for non-traditional life insurance and investment contracts is computed as deposits net of withdrawals made by the contract holder, plus amounts credited based on contract specifications, less contract fees and charges assessed, plus any additional interest.
24090_16_ITEM15_P52_S1	Annuity interest crediting rates range from 3.0% to 5.5% annually.
24090_16_ITEM15_P52_S2	Benefits and expenses are charged against the account balance to recognize costs as incurred over the estimated lives of the contracts.
24090_16_ITEM15_P52_S3	Expenses include interest credited to contract account balances and benefits paid in excess of contract account balances.
24090_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	Unpaid claims on accident and health policies represent the estimated liability for benefit expenses, both reported but not paid and incurred but not reported to the Company.
24090_16_ITEM15_P53_S1	Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated using individual case basis valuations and statistical analyzes.
24090_16_ITEM15_P53_S2	Those estimates are subject to the effects of trends in claim severity and frequency.
24090_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	Anticipated investment income is not considered in determining whether a premium deficiency exists with respect to short-duration contracts.
24090_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	Premium deposits accrue interest at rates ranging from 4.0% to 8.25% per annum.
24090_16_ITEM15_P55_S1	The cost of insurance is included in the premium when collected and interest is credited annually to deposit accounts.
24090_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	The development of liabilities for future policy benefits requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding mortality, morbidity, lapse, expense, and investment experience.
24090_16_ITEM15_P56_S1	These estimates are based primarily on historical experience and future expectations of mortality, morbidity, expense, persistency, and investment assumptions.
24090_16_ITEM15_P56_S2	Actual results could differ materially from estimates.
24090_16_ITEM15_P56_S3	We monitor actual experience and revise assumptions as necessary.
24090_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	Goodwill is the difference between the purchase price in a business combination and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, and is not amortized.
24090_16_ITEM15_P57_S1	Other intangible assets include various state insurance licenses, which have been determined to have indefinite useful lives and, therefore, are not amortized.
24090_16_ITEM15_P57_S2	Both goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are subject to annual impairment analyzes.
24090_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	The goodwill impairment test uses a two-step process as set forth under current accounting guidance.
24090_16_ITEM15_P58_S1	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
24090_16_ITEM15_P58_S2	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment.
24090_16_ITEM15_P58_S3	In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value.
24090_16_ITEM15_P58_S4	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
24090_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	Management's determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations, the level of the Company's Class A common stock price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit.
24090_16_ITEM15_P59_S1	Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections.
24090_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had goodwill of $12.6 million allocated to the Life Insurance segment and $4.6 million allocated to the Home Service Insurance segment.
24090_16_ITEM15_P60_S1	The Company completes its annual goodwill assessment for the individual reporting units within the Life Insurance segment and Home Service Insurance segment as of December 31 each year.
24090_16_ITEM15_P60_S2	There was no impairment of goodwill in 2015 , 2014 or 2013 .
24090_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , participating business approximated 61.3% and 60.7% of direct life insurance in force, respectively.
24090_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	Future policy benefits on participating policies are estimated based on net level premium reserves for death and endowment policy benefits with interest rates ranging from 3.0% to 9.0% , and the cash surrender values described in such contracts.
24090_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	over 20 years and remaining there for the duration.
24090_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	Earnings and dividends on participating policies are allocated based on policies in force.
24090_16_ITEM15_P65_S0	Policyholder dividends are determined based on the discretion of the Board of Directors of the policy issuing subsidiary.
24090_16_ITEM15_P65_S1	Policyholder dividends are accrued over the premium paying periods of the insurance contract.
24090_16_ITEM15_P66_S0	Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.
24090_16_ITEM15_P66_S1	Diluted earnings per share are computed under the if-converted method for convertible securities and the treasury stock method for warrants, giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock, including options, warrants and convertible/redeemable preferred stock.
24090_16_ITEM15_P66_S2	The basic and diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock are one half the earnings per share of the Class A common stock.
24090_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
24090_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
24090_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered.
24090_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	A deferred tax asset is recorded only if a determination is made that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax treatment on which the deferred tax asset depends will be sustained in the event of an audit.
24090_16_ITEM15_P69_S1	These determinations inherently involve management's judgment.
24090_16_ITEM15_P69_S2	In addition, the Company must record a tax valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
24090_16_ITEM15_P69_S3	This valuation allowance is in essence a contra account to the deferred tax asset.
24090_16_ITEM15_P69_S4	Management must determine the portion of the deferred tax asset and resulting tax benefit that may not be realized based upon judgment of expected outcomes.
24090_16_ITEM15_P70_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_16_ITEM15_P70_S1	Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position.
24090_16_ITEM15_P71_S0	Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
24090_16_ITEM15_P71_S1	Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to thirty years.
24090_16_ITEM15_P72_S0	We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated life of the improvements.
24090_16_ITEM15_P72_S1	The Company has no capital leases.
24090_16_ITEM15_P73_S0	The following is a summary of property and equipment.
24090_16_ITEM15_P74_S0	Reinsurance recoverable includes expected reimbursements for policyholder claim amounts in excess of the Company's retention, as well as profit sharing and experience refund accruals.
24090_16_ITEM15_P74_S1	Reinsurance recoverable is reduced for estimated uncollectible amounts, if any.
24090_16_ITEM15_P75_S0	Reinsurance premiums, losses and adjustment expenses are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts.
24090_16_ITEM15_P75_S1	The cost of reinsurance related to long duration contracts is accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies.
24090_16_ITEM15_P75_S2	The cost of reinsurance related to short duration contracts is accounted for over the coverage period.
24090_16_ITEM15_P75_S3	Profit-sharing and similar adjustable provisions are accrued based on the experience of the underlying policies.
24090_16_ITEM15_P76_S0	An estimated loss from a contingency is accrued and charged to results of operations only if both of the following conditions are met:
24090_16_ITEM15_P77_S0	Information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable (virtual certainty is not required) that an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred as of the date of the financial statements; and 2.
24090_16_ITEM15_P77_S1	The amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
24090_16_ITEM15_P78_S0	Reasonable estimation of a possible loss does not require estimating a single amount of the loss.
24090_16_ITEM15_P78_S1	It requires that a loss be accrued if it can be estimated within a range.
24090_16_ITEM15_P78_S2	If an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, that amount is accrued.
24090_16_ITEM15_P78_S3	If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
24090_16_ITEM15_P79_S0	A gain contingency is an uncertain situation that will be resolved in the future, possibly resulting in a gain.
24090_16_ITEM15_P79_S1	We do not allow the recognition of a gain contingency prior to settlement of the underlying event.
24090_16_ITEM15_P79_S2	If we were to have a gain contingency, we would disclose it in the notes to the financial statements.
24090_16_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company considers as cash equivalents all securities whose duration does not exceed 90 days at the date of acquisition.
24090_16_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company considers investments maturing within one year at acquisition as short-term.
24090_16_ITEM15_P81_S1	These securities are carried at amortized cost, which approximates market value.
24090_16_ITEM15_P82_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
24090_16_ITEM15_P82_S1	Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
24090_16_ITEM15_P83_S0	Certain amounts presented in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
24090_16_ITEM15_P84_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.
24090_16_ITEM15_P84_S1	The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
24090_16_ITEM15_P84_S2	The guidance provides a five-step process to achieve that core principle.
24090_16_ITEM15_P85_S0	ASU 2014-09 requires disclosures enabling users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
24090_16_ITEM15_P85_S1	Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.
24090_16_ITEM15_P86_S0	ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, using one of two retrospective application methods.
24090_16_ITEM15_P86_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this ASU will have on its financial statements.
24090_16_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Affordable Care Act was passed by the U.S. Congress in 2010.
24090_16_ITEM15_P87_S1	The Company has considered its medical and dental plans provided for employees and agents.
24090_16_ITEM15_P87_S2	While the Company will incur additional costs associated with the implementation of this Act, it does not believe these costs or ongoing costs associated with this Act will have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.
24090_16_ITEM15_P88_S0	The Company does not provide a separate prescription drug plan to its retirees.
24090_16_ITEM15_P88_S1	In addition, the Company does not sell any medical insurance or prescription drug coverage.
24090_16_ITEM15_P88_S2	The Company will continue to assess the information contained in this Act as additional guidance becomes available and as additional implications are understood or clarified.
24090_16_ITEM15_P89_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( the Dodd-Frank Act ) includes a provision to establish a Federal Insurance Office with the primary purpose of collecting information to better understand insurance issues at the federal level and to monitor the extent to which traditional underserved communities and consumers, minorities and low and moderate income persons have access to affordable insurance products.
24090_16_ITEM15_P89_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act also contains provisions affecting financial institutions, credit rating agencies and other commercial and consumer businesses.
24090_16_ITEM15_P90_S0	The Company invests primarily in fixed maturity securities, which totaled 85.0% of total investments and cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM15_P90_S1	Holdings in high quality fixed maturity securities rated A or higher by Standard Poor's, Inc. totaled 82.5% of investment holdings in this category, reflecting the conservative investment philosophy of the Company.
24090_16_ITEM15_P91_S0	The cost, gross unrealized gains and losses and fair value of investments in fixed maturities and equity securities, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , are as follows.
24090_16_ITEM15_P92_S0	For investments of available-for-sale fixed maturities that have unrealized losses as of December 31, 2015 , the cost, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer and fair value are as follows.
24090_16_ITEM15_P93_S0	The available-for-sale fixed maturities in a gross unrealized loss position for more than 12 months is primarily related to rises in interest rates which results in lower market prices on fixed maturity securities that have lower coupons than the current market rate.
24090_16_ITEM15_P93_S1	This is interest rate risk and is not a signal of impairment.
24090_16_ITEM15_P93_S2	Management has completed its assessment of other-than-temporary impairment of these securities.
24090_16_ITEM15_P93_S3	Based on our evaluation of the credit worthiness of the issuers and because we do not intend to sell the investments, nor is it likely that we would be required to sell these investments, before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, none of the unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporary.
24090_16_ITEM15_P94_S0	We monitor all debt and equity securities on an on-going basis relative to changes in credit ratings, market prices, earnings trends and financial performance, in addition to specific region or industry reviews.
24090_16_ITEM15_P94_S1	Our impairment review, in accordance with current guidance, is performed by the Company at each reporting date and management uses its best judgment to decide if impairment is other-than-temporary.
24090_16_ITEM15_P94_S2	We determine other-than-temporary impairment by reviewing relevant evidence related to the specific security issuer, as well as our intent to sell the security or whether we more likely than not will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery.
24090_16_ITEM15_P95_S0	All securities with a market price below par were segregated and reviewed as of December 31, 2015 based upon the items above for impairment.
24090_16_ITEM15_P96_S0	For investments of available-for-sale fixed maturities and equity securities that have unrealized losses as of December 31, 2014 , the cost, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer and fair value are as follows.
24090_16_ITEM15_P97_S0	The amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturities at December 31, 2015 by contractual maturity are shown below.
24090_16_ITEM15_P98_S0	Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
24090_16_ITEM15_P99_S0	Securities not due at a single maturity date have been reflected based upon the final stated maturity.
24090_16_ITEM15_P100_S0	The Company had no investments in any one entity which exceeded 10% of stockholders' equity at December 31, 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM15_P100_S1	In addition, there were no investments that were non-income producing for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM15_P101_S0	Major categories of net investment income are summarized as follows:
24090_16_ITEM15_P102_S0	Proceeds and gross realized gains and losses from sales of fixed maturities available-for-sale for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 are summarized as follows:
24090_16_ITEM15_P103_S0	In 2015, there were no sales of fixed maturities available-for-sale.
24090_16_ITEM15_P103_S1	In 2014 , two bonds were sold for a gain related to the non-insurance subsidiaries holdings.
24090_16_ITEM15_P103_S2	There were no securities sold from the held-to-maturity portfolio in 2015 , 2014 or 2013 .
24090_16_ITEM15_P104_S0	Proceeds and gross realized gains and losses from sales of equity securities for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 are summarized as follows:
24090_16_ITEM15_P105_S0	In 2015 , the Company sold six equity and bond mutual funds, some of which had been previously impaired, that resulted in a net gain of $35,000 due to regulatory accounting considerations.
24090_16_ITEM15_P105_S1	All mutual funds are considered common stocks for regulatory accounting purposes and the RBC charge for stocks is extremely high.
24090_16_ITEM15_P106_S0	In 2014 three equity and bond mutual funds were sold that resulted in a net loss of $51,000 due to circumstances that arose based upon the current environment and due to the fact that they were shorter duration funds.
24090_16_ITEM15_P106_S1	During 2013 two equity mutual funds were sold resulting in a net loss of $0.4 million , for tax planning purposes.
24090_16_ITEM15_P107_S0	Realized investment gains (losses) are as follows:
24090_16_ITEM15_P108_S0	We recorded OTTI write-downs in 2015 of $5.4 million related to two equity bond mutual funds and two bond issuers due to credit quality issues that arose in the current year.
24090_16_ITEM15_P109_S0	The Company had realized losses of $111,000 from calls of fixed maturities in 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM15_P110_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
24090_16_ITEM15_P110_S1	We hold fixed maturity and equity securities that are carried at fair value.
24090_16_ITEM15_P111_S0	Fair value measurements are generally based upon observable and unobservable inputs.
24090_16_ITEM15_P111_S1	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.
24090_16_ITEM15_P111_S2	We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
24090_16_ITEM15_P112_S0	All assets and liabilities carried at fair value are required to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
24090_16_ITEM15_P113_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
24090_16_ITEM15_P114_S0	Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose inputs or whose significant value drivers are observable.
24090_16_ITEM15_P115_S0	Level 3 - Instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable.
24090_16_ITEM15_P116_S0	Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as U.S. Treasury securities, publicly traded mutual fund investments and individual stocks.
24090_16_ITEM15_P117_S0	Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued by independent pricing services or broker quotes.
24090_16_ITEM15_P117_S1	These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various inputs, such as interest rates, credit spreads and foreign exchange rates for the underlying financial instruments.
24090_16_ITEM15_P117_S2	All significant inputs are observable, or derived from observable information in the marketplace or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
24090_16_ITEM15_P118_S0	Financial instruments in this category primarily include corporate fixed maturity securities, U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise securities, municipal securities and certain mortgage and asset-backed securities.
24090_16_ITEM15_P119_S0	Level 3 is comprised of financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on non-binding broker prices utilizing significant inputs not based on, or corroborated by, readily available market information.
24090_16_ITEM15_P119_S1	This category consists of two private placement mortgage-backed securities where we cannot corroborate the significant valuation inputs with market observable data.
24090_16_ITEM15_P120_S0	The following table sets forth our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the date indicated.
24090_16_ITEM15_P121_S0	At December 31, 2015 , the fixed maturities, valued using a third-party pricing source, totaled $722.9 million for Level 2 assets and comprised 95.2% of total reported fair value.
24090_16_ITEM15_P121_S1	Fair values for Level 3 assets are based upon unadjusted broker quotes that are non-binding.
24090_16_ITEM15_P122_S0	The Level 1 and Level 2 valuations are reviewed and validated quarterly through random testing by comparisons to separate pricing models, other third party pricing services, and back tested to recent trades.
24090_16_ITEM15_P122_S1	In addition, we obtain information relative to the third party pricing models and review model parameters for reasonableness.
24090_16_ITEM15_P122_S2	For the period ended December 31, 2015 , there were no material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine fair values, and no broker or third party prices were changed from the values received.
24090_16_ITEM15_P123_S0	There were no transfers made between level 1 and 2 securities at December 31, 2015 or 2014 .
24090_16_ITEM15_P124_S0	Fair values of these securities are based upon quoted market price and are classified as Level 1 assets.
24090_16_ITEM15_P125_S0	The following table presents additional information about fixed maturity securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and for which we have utilized significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs to determine fair value:
24090_16_ITEM15_P126_S0	We review the fair value hierarchy classifications each reporting period.
24090_16_ITEM15_P127_S0	Changes in the observability of the valuation attributes may result in a reclassification of certain financial assets.
24090_16_ITEM15_P127_S1	Such reclassifications, if any, are reported as transfers in and out of Level 3 at the beginning fair value for the reporting period in which the changes occur.
24090_16_ITEM15_P128_S0	Estimates of fair values are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market prices and information about the financial instrument.
24090_16_ITEM15_P128_S1	The estimated fair values of financial instruments presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company might realize in actual market transactions.
24090_16_ITEM15_P128_S2	The carrying amount and fair value for the financial assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at each year-end were as follows:
24090_16_ITEM15_P129_S0	Fair values for fixed income securities, which are characterized as Level 2 assets in the fair value hierarchy, are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar securities.
24090_16_ITEM15_P129_S1	In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other assumptions, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.
24090_16_ITEM15_P130_S0	Mortgage loans are secured principally by residential properties and commercial properties.
24090_16_ITEM15_P130_S1	Weighted average interest rates for these loans were approximately 6.2% and 6.3% per year, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, with maturities ranging from 2 to 26 years.
24090_16_ITEM15_P130_S2	Management estimated the fair value using an annual interest rate of 6.25% at December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
24090_16_ITEM15_P130_S3	Our mortgage loans are considered Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_16_ITEM15_P131_S0	Policy loans have a weighted average annual interest rate of 7.7% as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and have no specified maturity dates.
24090_16_ITEM15_P132_S0	These loans typically carry an interest rate that is tied to the crediting rate applied to the related policy and contract reserves.
24090_16_ITEM15_P133_S0	Policy loans are an integral part of the life insurance policies that we have in force and cannot be valued separately and are not marketable.
24090_16_ITEM15_P133_S1	Therefore, the fair value approximates the carrying value and policy loans are considered Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_16_ITEM15_P134_S0	The fair value of short-term investments approximate carrying value due to their short-term nature.
24090_16_ITEM15_P134_S1	Our short-term investments are considered Level 2 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_16_ITEM15_P135_S0	The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximate carrying value and are characterized as Level 1 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_16_ITEM15_P136_S0	The fair value of the Company's liabilities under annuity contract policies, which are considered Level 3 assets, was estimated at December 31, 2015 using discounted cash flows based upon a swap rate curve with interest rates ranging from 0.60% to 3.02% based upon swap rates adjusted for various risk adjustments.
24090_16_ITEM15_P136_S1	The fair value of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in the overall management of interest rate risk, which seeks to minimize exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment maturities with amounts due under insurance contracts.
24090_16_ITEM15_P137_S0	Various assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit reserves of life insurance include the following: a) valuation interest rates from 2.5% to 6.75% per year; b) mortality assumptions are from the 1955 to 1960, 1965 to 1970, 1975 to 1980 and 2001 Select and Ultimate mortality tables; and c) withdrawals are based primarily on actual historical termination rates.
24090_16_ITEM15_P138_S0	The following table presents information on changes in the liability for life, accident and health and property policy and contract claims for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .

24090_16_ITEM15_P140_S1	IRC Section 7702 remediation claims costs added $591,000 to the prior years claims incurred making it look less favorable than actual experience.
24090_16_ITEM15_P140_S2	The favorable development in 2013 of $417,000 primarily related to CICA.
24090_16_ITEM15_P141_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company reinsures portions of certain policies that we underwrite to limit disproportionate risks.
24090_16_ITEM15_P141_S1	During 2015 and 2014 , we retained varying amounts of individual insurance up to a maximum retention of $100,000 on any life.
24090_16_ITEM15_P141_S2	The Company also reinsures 100% of our accidental death benefit rider coverage.
24090_16_ITEM15_P141_S3	Catastrophe reinsurance is in place for our property policies.
24090_16_ITEM15_P141_S4	In 2015 and 2014 , this reinsurance provided $10,000,000 of coverage above a $500,000 deductible.
24090_16_ITEM15_P142_S0	Our health insurance policies are substantially all reinsured on a 100% coinsurance basis.
24090_16_ITEM15_P142_S1	We remain contingently liable to the extent that the reinsuring companies cannot meet their obligations under these reinsurance treaties.
24090_16_ITEM15_P143_S0	Our amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and reserves ceded to reinsurers.
24090_16_ITEM15_P143_S1	We obtain reinsurance from multiple reinsurers, and we monitor concentration as well as financial strength ratings of our principal reinsurers.
24090_16_ITEM15_P143_S2	The ratings by A.M. Best Company range from B+ (Good) to A+ (Superior).
24090_16_ITEM15_P144_S0	To protect our position, we have established and funded a trust to cover the contingent liabilities related to accident and health reinsurance ceded to Unified Life Insurance Company, which represents $50,000 of the $4.2 million of reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM15_P145_S0	Assumed and ceded life reinsurance activity as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 is summarized as follows:
24090_16_ITEM15_P146_S0	The Company's reinsurance recoveries on ceded reinsurance were $4.2 million in 2015 and $4.4 million in 2014 .
24090_16_ITEM15_P146_S1	Premiums, claims and surrenders assumed and ceded for all lines of business for these years are summarized as follows:
24090_16_ITEM15_P147_S0	SPFIC has catastrophe reinsurance that covers the first event in excess of a $500,000 deductible up to $10.0 million .
24090_16_ITEM15_P147_S1	In consideration for a reinstatement premium, second event coverage is provided in excess of a $500,000 deductible up to $10.0 million .
24090_16_ITEM15_P147_S2	The annual premium was approximately $0.9 million in 2015 , $1.0 million in 2014 and $1.1 million in 2013 .
24090_16_ITEM15_P148_S0	The two classes of our common stock are equal in all respects, except (a) each Class A share receives twice the cash dividends paid on a per share basis to the Class B common stock; and (b) the Class B common stock elects a simple majority of the Board of Directors of Citizens and the Class A common stock elects the remaining directors.
24090_16_ITEM15_P149_S0	The table below shows the combined total of all of our insurance subsidiaries' capital and surplus and net income (loss) for life insurance operations and property insurance operations, although these amounts are not all available as dividends to Citizens, Inc., because only CICA is directly owned by Citizens, Inc.
24090_16_ITEM15_P149_S1	All other subsidiaries are owned by CICA.
24090_16_ITEM15_P150_S0	Generally, the net assets of the insurance subsidiaries available for transfer to their immediate parent are limited to the greater of the subsidiary net gain from operations during the preceding year or 10% of the subsidiary net statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_16_ITEM15_P150_S1	Under these practices, total surplus at December 31, 2015 was $31.9 million and net loss from operations was $(1.2) million for CICA.
24090_16_ITEM15_P150_S2	Based upon statutory net gain from operations and surplus of CICA as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 , a dividend of approximately $3.2 million could be paid to the Company without prior regulatory approval in 2016 .
24090_16_ITEM15_P150_S3	Payments of dividends in excess of such amounts would generally require approval by regulatory authorities.
24090_16_ITEM15_P151_S0	CICA, CNLIC, SPLIC, MGLIC and SPFIC have calculated their risk based capital ("RBC") in accordance with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' Model Rule and the RBC rules as adopted by their respective states of domicile.
24090_16_ITEM15_P151_S1	All insurance subsidiaries exceeded RBC minimum levels at December 31, 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM15_P152_S0	As of December 31, 2014, we determined that a portion of the life insurance policies issued by our subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") of 1986.
24090_16_ITEM15_P152_S1	This tax code section allows for qualifying products sold to clients to have favorable tax treatment such as the products inside build up is not taxable.
24090_16_ITEM15_P152_S2	By identifying certain products that we have sold with the intention of this favorable tax treatment but in fact they do not qualify under the IRC rules, our policyholders and CICA may now be subject to additional tax liabilities.
24090_16_ITEM15_P153_S0	The policies at issue were sold most substantially to non-U.S. citizens residing abroad and to a lesser extent domestically.
24090_16_ITEM15_P153_S1	Based upon a review of the options available to the Company we have determined we will not remediate our endowments and endowment-like products under IRC 7702 we have sold to non-U.S. citizens.
24090_16_ITEM15_P153_S2	We do intend to remediate the domestic products we have sold to U.S. citizens.
24090_16_ITEM15_P153_S3	In addition, as part of our continuing review we determined in July of 2015 certain annuity contracts do not contain qualifying language under IRC 72(s) as intended that would have provided for favorable tax treatment of the annuities.
24090_16_ITEM15_P153_S4	This issue affects both our domestic and international contract holders.
24090_16_ITEM15_P153_S5	The Company has continued to refine the understanding of the tax failures as previously reported by preparing an individual policy calculation and has reflected the related exposure for the current reporting period as noted below.
24090_16_ITEM15_P153_S6	Failure of these policies to qualify under IRC Sections 7702 and 72(s) has resulted in additional liabilities and expenses as described below.
24090_16_ITEM15_P154_S0	The products have been and continue to be appropriately reported under U.S. GAAP for financial reporting.
24090_16_ITEM15_P155_S0	The failure of these policies to qualify under Sections 7702 and 72(s) results in an estimated liability as of December 31, 2015 of $ 14.6 million, after tax, related to projected IRS toll charges and fees of $ 13.4 million as well as claims liability for past claims and reserves increases to bring policies into compliance totaling $ 1.2 million.
24090_16_ITEM15_P155_S1	The range of financial estimates relative to this issue is $9.0 million to $45.5 million , after tax.
24090_16_ITEM15_P155_S2	This estimated range includes projected toll charges and fees payable to the IRS, as well as estimated increased payout obligations to current and former holders of non-compliant domestic life insurance policies expected to result from remediation of those policies.
24090_16_ITEM15_P155_S3	The amount of our liabilities and expenses depends on a number of uncertainties, including the number of prior tax years for which we may be liable to the IRS, the number of domestic life insurance policies we will be required to remediate, and the methodology applicable to the calculation of taxable benefits under non-compliant policies.
24090_16_ITEM15_P155_S4	Given the range of potential outcomes and the significant variables assumed in establishing our estimates, actual amounts incurred may exceed our reserve and also could exceed the high end of our estimated range of liabilities and expenses.
24090_16_ITEM15_P156_S0	and expenses change in the future, our financial condition and results of operation may be materially adversely affected.
24090_16_ITEM15_P156_S1	Management believes that based upon current information we have recorded the best estimate liability to date.
24090_16_ITEM15_P157_S0	Accruals for loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
24090_16_ITEM15_P157_S1	The process of determining our best estimate and the estimated range was a complex undertaking including insight from external consultants and involved management s judgment based upon a variety of factors known at the time.
24090_16_ITEM15_P157_S2	In addition, we have recorded expenses of $ 2.0 million in 2015 and it is reasonably possible that we may incur additional costs associated with these issues in 2016 related to potential system remediation and consulting costs.
24090_16_ITEM15_P157_S3	We believe these costs could be $0.5 million to $1.5 million but due to the uncertainty of actions we cannot reasonably estimate these costs with any reliability.
24090_16_ITEM15_P157_S4	Actual amounts incurred may exceed this estimate and will be recorded as they become probable and can be reasonably estimated.
24090_16_ITEM15_P158_S0	In 2007 and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the Attorney General for the State of Louisiana filed suit against SPFIC and every other homeowner insurer doing business in the State of Louisiana, on behalf of the State of Louisiana and certain Road Home fund recipients.
24090_16_ITEM15_P158_S1	On July 18, 2013 , a full and final settlement was reached between SPFIC and the State of Louisiana resolving all claims against SPFIC in the Road Home matter for approximately $183,000 .
24090_16_ITEM15_P158_S2	This amount did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
24090_16_ITEM15_P159_S0	From time to time we are subject to legal and regulatory actions relating to our business.
24090_16_ITEM15_P159_S1	As a result, we incur defense costs, including attorneys' fees, other direct litigation costs and the expenditure of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_16_ITEM15_P160_S0	As part of our efforts to review and improve our compliance controls, we completed an internal risk assessment of our compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA") anti-money laundering requirements.
24090_16_ITEM15_P160_S1	We are in the process of enhancing our BSA compliance program with additional controls based on our risk assessment.
24090_16_ITEM15_P160_S2	Although we are not yet able to determine the extent of any potential loss, we cannot assure you that the impact of any non-compliance will not have a material impact upon the company.
24090_16_ITEM15_P161_S0	Unclaimed Property Contingencies The Company has been informed by the Louisiana Department of Treasury, Arkansas Auditor of State and the Texas State Comptroller, that they authorized an audit of Citizens, Inc. and its affiliates for compliance with unclaimed property laws.
24090_16_ITEM15_P161_S1	This audit is being conducted by Verus Financial LLC on behalf of the states.
24090_16_ITEM15_P162_S0	The external audit may result in additional payments to beneficiaries, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws, administrative penalties, interest, and changes to the Company's procedures for the identification and escheatment of abandoned property.
24090_16_ITEM15_P162_S1	The Company believes additional escheatment of funds in Arkansas or Texas will not be material to our financial condition or results of operations.
24090_16_ITEM15_P162_S2	However, additional escheatment of funds in Louisiana, which may subsequently be deemed abandoned under the Louisiana Department of Treasury s audit, could be substantial for SPLIC if the Louisiana Department of Treasury chooses to disregard recent unclaimed property litigation in favor of the insurance industry.
24090_16_ITEM15_P162_S3	At this time, the Company is not able to estimate any of these possible amounts in 2016.
24090_16_ITEM15_P163_S0	We have the following operating lease commitments as of December 31, 2015 with the payments due by the periods indicated below.
24090_16_ITEM15_P164_S0	Operating lease expense was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , and $0.6 million and $0.6 million for the same periods ended 2014 and 2013 .
24090_16_ITEM15_P165_S0	The Company has three reportable segments: Life Insurance, Home Service Insurance and Other Non-Insurance Enterprises.
24090_16_ITEM15_P165_S1	The accounting policies of the segments are in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are the same as those described in the summary of significant account policies.
24090_16_ITEM15_P166_S0	We evaluate profit and loss performance based on U.S. GAAP net income before federal income taxes for our three reportable segments.
24090_16_ITEM15_P167_S0	The Company has no reportable differences between segments and consolidated operations.
24090_16_ITEM15_P168_S0	The table below summarizes assets by segment.
24090_16_ITEM15_P169_S0	Major categories of earned premiums are summarized as follows:
24090_16_ITEM15_P170_S0	The following table sets forth the Company's annual total of earned premiums from geographic area for the years indicated:
24090_16_ITEM15_P171_S0	Our federal income tax expense (benefit) was $1.0 million , $3.7 million and $2.1 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
24090_16_ITEM15_P171_S1	This represents effective tax rates of (37.3)% , (134.0)% and 30.8% , respectively.
24090_16_ITEM15_P171_S2	The 2014 impact is the result of costs to remediate the tax compliance issue we identified in early 2015 which impacted the 2014 effective tax rate negatively by approximately $3.5 million due to approximately $ 10.0 million of these costs not being deductible for tax.
24090_16_ITEM15_P171_S3	Additionally, after further refinement of these amounts in 2015 plus the effects of toll charges for the IRC Section 72(s) tax compliance issue identified in the second quarter of 2015, an additional $ 3.3 million of nondeductible toll charges were recorded in 2015, which negatively impacted the current year tax rate by $ 1.2 million.
24090_16_ITEM15_P172_S0	The Company previously had a valuation allowance related to OTTI write downs on stocks and stock mutual funds in 2008.
24090_16_ITEM15_P172_S1	Due to the sale of these mutual funds in 2009 and 2010, the valuation allowance was released in its entirety in 2009 and 2010.
24090_16_ITEM15_P172_S2	Part of this valuation allowance was released to other comprehensive income ("OCI") in 2009 due to the increase in fair value of mutual funds and stocks still owned.
24090_16_ITEM15_P172_S3	As the stocks and mutual funds have been disposed of since 2009, this valuation allowance has been released as reductions of tax expense.
24090_16_ITEM15_P172_S4	During 2015, 2014 and 2013, $42,000 , and $21,000 and $20,000 has been released as a reduction of tax expense, respectively.
24090_16_ITEM15_P172_S5	The entire valuation allowance has now been released.
24090_16_ITEM15_P173_S0	The table below summarizes the changes in the valuation allowance.
24090_16_ITEM15_P174_S0	A reconciliation of federal income tax expense computed by applying the federal income tax rate of 35% in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 to income (loss) before federal income tax expense is as follows:
24090_16_ITEM15_P175_S0	Income tax expense (benefit) consists of:
24090_16_ITEM15_P176_S0	Deferred tax expense is comprised of $4.1 million deferred tax expense less $42,000 tax benefit released from OCI.
24090_16_ITEM15_P177_S0	The components of deferred federal income taxes are as follows:
24090_16_ITEM15_P178_S0	A summary of the changes in the components of deferred federal and state income taxes is as follows:
24090_16_ITEM15_P179_S0	The Company and our subsidiaries had no net operating losses at December 31, 2015 .
24090_16_ITEM15_P180_S0	At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we determined that as a result of our historical income, projected future income, tax planning strategies, and the nature of the items from which the deferred tax assets are derived, other than assets for which OTTI was recorded, it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized.
24090_16_ITEM15_P181_S0	The Company has sufficient unrealized gains in its available-for-sale portfolio so as not to need a valuation allowance for OTTI write downs.
24090_16_ITEM15_P182_S0	The Company and our subsidiaries had approximately $ 1.7 million of capital loss carry-forwards at December 31, 2015 which expire, if unused in, 2020.
24090_16_ITEM15_P183_S0	No new additions are expected to be made to this account.
24090_16_ITEM15_P183_S1	Federal income taxes will become payable thereon at the then current tax rate (a) when and if distributions to shareholders, other than stock dividends and other limited exceptions, are made in excess of the accumulated previously taxed income; or (b) when a company ceases to be a life insurance company as defined by the Internal Revenue Code and such termination is not due to another life insurance company acquiring its assets in a nontaxable transaction.
24090_16_ITEM15_P184_S0	We do not anticipate any transactions that would cause any part of this amount to become taxable.
24090_16_ITEM15_P184_S1	However, should the balance at December 31, 2015 become taxable, the tax computed at present rates would be approximately $1.2 million .
24090_16_ITEM15_P185_S0	The Company recognizes only the impact of tax positions that, based on their technical merits, are more likely than not to be sustained upon an audit by the taxing authority.
24090_16_ITEM15_P186_S0	A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
24090_16_ITEM15_P187_S0	This unrecognized tax benefit is reported net in current federal income tax payable in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
24090_16_ITEM15_P188_S0	None of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015 would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.
24090_16_ITEM15_P188_S1	There is a reasonable possibility that the unrecognized tax benefit relative to reserve deductions will decrease by $78.1 million within the next twelve months based upon the filing of an accounting method change in 2016.
24090_16_ITEM15_P189_S0	The Company s practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
24090_16_ITEM15_P189_S1	The Company has recorded a material interest expense uncertainty of $3.5 million , net of tax, with respect to an unrecognized tax benefit as of December 31, 2015 .

24090_16_ITEM15_P196_S4	The plan does not permit employee contributions.
24090_16_ITEM15_P197_S0	The Company is primarily self-insured for employee health benefits.
24090_16_ITEM15_P197_S1	The Company records its self-insurance liability based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.
24090_16_ITEM15_P197_S2	There is stop-loss coverage for amounts in excess of $100,000 per individual per year.
24090_16_ITEM15_P197_S3	If more claims are made than were estimated or if the costs of actual claims increase beyond what was anticipated, reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional accruals may be required in future periods.
24090_16_ITEM15_P198_S0	The Company sponsors the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan (the "Plan"), which is administered by an independent third party.
24090_16_ITEM15_P198_S1	The Plan is a means for new and existing investors in our Class A Common Stock to purchase and sell shares at market prices.

24090_16_ITEM15_P199_S0	Citizens, Inc. purchased Class A common shares during 2014 that were held by a subsidiary at market value as of the transaction date, which approximated $0.4 million .
24090_16_ITEM15_P199_S1	This transaction was eliminated for financial reporting purposes in accordance with consolidation accounting, but generated a tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaling approximately $0.1 million .
24090_16_ITEM15_P200_S0	In 2015 , SPLIC paid a dividend to CICA in the amount of $ 1.8 million .
24090_16_ITEM15_P201_S0	The following table contains selected unaudited financial data for each quarter.

24090_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	Citizens, Inc. ( Citizens or the "Company") is an insurance holding company incorporated in Colorado serving the life insurance needs of individuals in the United States since 1969 and internationally since 1975.
24090_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	Through our insurance subsidiaries, we pursue a strategy of offering traditional insurance products in niche markets where we believe we are able to achieve competitive advantages.
24090_17_ITEM1_P0_S2	We had approximately $1.6 billion of assets at December 31, 2016 and approximately $4.5 billion of insurance in force.
24090_17_ITEM1_P0_S3	Our core insurance operations include issuing and servicing:
24090_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	final expense and limited liability property policies to middle and lower income households in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas through employee and independent agents in our home service distribution channel and funeral homes.
24090_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	We were formed in 1969 by our founder, Harold E. Riley.
24090_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	Prior to our formation, Mr. Riley had many years of experience in the international and domestic life insurance business.
24090_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	Historically, our Company has experienced growth through acquisitions in the domestic market and through organic market expansion in the international market.
24090_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	We strive to generate bottom line returns using knowledge of our niche markets and our well-established distribution channels.
24090_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our business has grown, both internationally and domestically, in recent years, though our profitability has declined.
24090_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	From 2012 through 2016 , revenues rose 21% from $202.8 million in 2012 to $245.4 million in 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM1_P4_S2	During that same period, our assets grew 35% from $1,171.8 million to $1,583.7 million .
24090_17_ITEM1_P4_S3	During this same period, our net income declined 61% from $4.9 million to $2.0 million , primarily as a result of other than temporary impairments ("OTTI"), expense related to an additional tax liability contingency and higher consulting and legal costs as we proactively addressed the tax liability contingency and undertook an assessment of our business model and strategies.

24090_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this Report.
24090_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	See Strategic Initiatives below for initiatives that the Company, its Board of Directors (the Board ) and the executive management team initiated in 2016 and will continue to pursue in 2017.
24090_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	On June 8, 2016, the Board appointed independent Board member Dr. Robert Sloan, as non-executive Chairman.

24090_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	On February 22, 2017, the Company announced the appointment of Gerald W. Shields to fill the open Board seat vacated by former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rick D. Riley.
24090_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	Mr. Shields joins the Board with over 37 years of technology experience, including significant life insurance experience as the Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer of AFLAC, Inc., a leading provider of supplemental insurance.
24090_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	Nolan, a management-consulting firm that caters to the insurance, health care, technology, and banking industries.
24090_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	He also currently serves as the Chief Information Officer of FirstCare Health Plans, a provider of comprehensive health care services to health maintenance organization (HMO) subscribers that also owns Southwest Life Health Insurance Company which offers the FirstCare PPO and life insurance products.
24090_17_ITEM1_P13_S2	Mr. Shields brings to the Board expertise in technology, cybersecurity and insurance operating systems, having significant experience directing these areas throughout his career.
24090_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	On February 27, 2017, the Company announced the appointment of Frank Keating as a director.
24090_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	Governor Keating is a partner at the law firm of Holland Knight, LLP.
24090_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	Governor Keating has held significant leadership positions in both the public and private sectors.
24090_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	In addition to serving as Governor of Oklahoma, his career included serving as CEO of the American Bankers Association and prior to that President and CEO of the American Council of Life Insurers, the trade association for the life insurance and retirement security industry.
24090_17_ITEM1_P15_S2	He also has served as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury and Associate Attorney General under President Ronald Reagan.

24090_17_ITEM1_P15_S5	His law enforcement career included serving as the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Oklahoma and as an FBI agent.
24090_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	The Company's Board of Directors and new executive management team are assessing the Company's domestic and international business models and business strategies with the assistance and support of external consultants and advisors.
24090_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	Specifically, we are evaluating the Company's international business model and considering potential options, the current economic and regulatory environment and sustainable business objectives.
24090_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	Incorporated in our business model review are analyses of (1) new products and our profitability; (2) a potential restructuring of our international business and operations; (3) potential upgrades to our technology systems and operations with a strategic focus on our future business needs and cyber risk; and (4) potential additions to our executive management structure, personnel needs and further compensation incentives.
24090_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	A prolonged low interest rate period has required us to revisit the benefits and dividends included under many policies offered internationally.
24090_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	In many cases, policyholders stand to benefit from significantly higher guarantees and dividends under our policies than the financial markets might otherwise offer.
24090_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	As such, the Company cut discretionary dividends on existing policies in 2016 and created new policies sold internationally to better reflect the prolonged low interest rate environment that we face.
24090_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	The Company reviews its investment strategies on a quarterly basis for premiums received in order to augment its rate of return.
24090_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	By combining more conservative interest rate features in our insurance policies with a more diversified investment strategy to improve returns on our investment portfolio, we intend to grow bottom line returns to shareholders.
24090_17_ITEM1_P18_S2	There is risk that these changes will result in lower demand for new policies, or that the financial markets will make our investment strategy more difficult.
24090_17_ITEM1_P18_S3	Despite the risks, the Company believes that such strategies are in the best interest of our shareholders.
24090_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	The following pages describe the operations of our three business segments: Life Insurance, Home Service and Other Non-Insurance Enterprises.
24090_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	Revenues derived from any single customer did not exceed 10% of consolidated revenues in any of the last three years.
24090_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our Life Insurance segment issues ordinary whole life insurance in the United States and in U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents.
24090_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	These contracts are designed to provide a fixed amount of insurance coverage over the life of the insured and can utilize rider benefits to provide additional increasing or decreasing coverage and annuity benefits to enhance accumulations.
24090_17_ITEM1_P20_S2	Additionally, endowment contracts are issued by the Company, which are principally accumulation contracts that incorporate an element of life insurance protection.
24090_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	For the majority of our business, we retain the first $100,000 of risk on any one life, reinsuring the remainder of the risk.
24090_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	We operate this segment through our subsidiaries: CICA Life Insurance Company of America ("CICA") and Citizens National Life Insurance Company ("CNLIC").
24090_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	We focus our sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies to residents in Latin America and the Pacific Rim.
24090_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we had insurance policies in force in approximately 30 countries, including Venezuela, Colombia, Taiwan, Ecuador and Brazil as our top producing countries.
24090_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	In 2016 , international direct premiums comprised approximately 73% of our total direct premiums, and exceeded 10% of our premiums for each of the last three years.
24090_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	We have participated in the foreign marketplace since 1975.
24090_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	We believe positive attributes of our international insurance business include:
24090_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	persistency experience and mortality rates that are comparable to our U.S. policies.
24090_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	We have implemented several policies and procedures to limit the risks of asset and premium loss relating to our international business.
24090_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	Approvals for policy issuance are made in our Austin, Texas office and policies are issued and delivered to the independent consultants, who deliver the policies to the insureds.
24090_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	We have no offices, employees or assets outside of the United States.
24090_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	Insurance policy applications and premium payments are submitted by the independent consultants or customers to us, and we review the applications in our home offices in Austin, Texas.
24090_17_ITEM1_P26_S2	Premiums are paid in U.S. Dollars by check, wire or credit card.
24090_17_ITEM1_P26_S3	The policies we issue contain limitations on benefits for certain causes of death, such as homicide.
24090_17_ITEM1_P26_S4	We have also developed disciplined underwriting criteria, which include medical reviews of applicants as well as background and reference checks.
24090_17_ITEM1_P26_S5	In addition, we have a claims policy that requires investigation of substantially all death claims.
24090_17_ITEM1_P26_S6	Furthermore, we perform background reviews and reference checks of prospective independent marketing firms and consultants.
24090_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	Our independent marketing firms and consultants specialize in marketing life insurance products and generally have several years of insurance marketing experience.
24090_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	We maintain contracts with the independent marketing firms pursuant to which they provide recruitment, training and supervision of their managers and associates in the service and placement of our products; however, all associates of these firms also contract directly with us as independent contractors and receive their compensation directly from us.
24090_17_ITEM1_P27_S2	Accordingly, should an arrangement between any independent marketing firm and us be terminated for any reason, we expect that we would seek to continue with the existing marketing arrangements with the associates of these firms.
24090_17_ITEM1_P27_S3	Our agreements with independent marketing firms and consultants typically provide that they are independent contractors responsible for their own operation expenses and are the representative of the prospective insured.
24090_17_ITEM1_P27_S4	In addition, the marketing firms guarantee any debts of their associates to us.
24090_17_ITEM1_P27_S5	The marketing firms receive commissions on all new and renewal policies serviced or placed by them or their associates.
24090_17_ITEM1_P27_S6	All of these contracts provide that the independent marketing firms and consultants are aware of and responsible for compliance with local laws.
24090_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	We offer several ordinary whole life insurance and endowment products designed to meet the needs of our non-U.S. policyowners.
24090_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	These policies have been structured to provide:
24090_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	lifetime income guarantees for an insured or for surviving beneficiaries.
24090_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our international products have living benefit features.
24090_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	Every policy contains guaranteed cash values and is participating (i.e., provides for cash dividends as apportioned by the board of directors).
24090_17_ITEM1_P30_S2	Once a policyowner pays the annual premium and the policy is issued, the owner becomes entitled to a cash dividend as well as an annual guaranteed endowment, if elected.
24090_17_ITEM1_P30_S3	The policyowner has several options with regard to the dividend and annual guaranteed endowments, including the right to assign policy values to the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan, registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), and administered in the United States by Computershare, our plan administrator and transfer agent.
24090_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	The life insurance business is highly competitive.
24090_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	We compete with a large number of stock and mutual life insurance companies internationally and domestically, as well as with financial institutions that offer insurance products.
24090_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	There are more than 800 life insurance companies in the United States, some of which also provide insurance to foreign residents.
24090_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	We face competition primarily from companies formed and operated in the country in which the insureds reside, from companies that operate in the same manner as we do and from companies that are foreign to the countries in which policies are sold, but issue insurance policies denominated in the local currency of those countries.
24090_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	A substantial number of companies may be deemed to have a competitive advantage over us due to their significantly greater financial resources, histories of successful operations and larger marketing forces.
24090_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	Because premiums on our international policies are paid in U.S. Dollars, and we pay claims and benefits in U.S. Dollars, we provide a product that is different from the products offered by foreign-domiciled companies.
24090_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	We believe our international policies are usually acquired by individuals in the upper middle class in their countries and those with significant net worth and earnings that place them in the upper income brackets of their respective countries.
24090_17_ITEM1_P35_S2	The policies sold by our foreign competitors are generally offered broadly and are priced using the mortality of the entire population of the geographic region.
24090_17_ITEM1_P35_S3	Our mortality charges are therefore typically lower, which provides a competitive advantage.
24090_17_ITEM1_P35_S4	Additionally, the assets backing the reserves for our foreign competitors' policies must be substantially invested in their respective countries and, therefore, are exposed to the inflationary risks and social or economic crises that have been more common in these foreign countries.
24090_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	In 2016 , domestic direct premiums comprised approximately 27% of our total direct premiums.
24090_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	The majority of our domestic inforce business results from blocks of business of insurance companies we have acquired over the past 18 years.
24090_17_ITEM1_P36_S2	Our acquisition transition strategy focuses on the introduction of our cash accumulation ordinary whole life products to independent agents associated with companies we have acquired, while continuing to service the needs of acquired policyholders.
24090_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	In the Mountain West, Midwest and the southern United States, we seek to serve middle-income households through the sale of cash accumulation ordinary whole life insurance products.
24090_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	Our distribution strategy is through independent agents.
24090_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	Over the past few years, new product sales have been modest while existing policies have been running off at a greater pace compressing the block of insurance in force.
24090_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our domestic life insurance products focus primarily on living needs and provide benefits focused toward accumulating money for the policyowner.
24090_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	The features of our domestic life insurance products include:
24090_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	an option to waive premium payments in the event of disability.
24090_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our life insurance products are principally designed to address the insured's concern about outliving his or her monthly income, while at the same time providing death benefits.
24090_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	The primary purpose of our product portfolio is to help the insured create capital for needs such as retirement income, children's higher education funds, business opportunities, emergencies and health care needs.
24090_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	The U.S. life insurance industry is a mature industry that, in recent years, has experienced little to no growth.
24090_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	Competition is intense because the life insurance industry is consolidating, with larger, more efficient and more effective organizations emerging from consolidation.
24090_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	Many domestic life insurance companies have significantly greater financial, marketing forces and other resources, longer business histories and more diversified lines of insurance products than we do.
24090_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	person as well as with direct mail and Internet sales campaigns.
24090_17_ITEM1_P44_S1	Although we may be at a competitive disadvantage to these entities, we believe our premium rates and policy features are generally competitive with those of other life insurance companies selling similar types of ordinary whole life insurance.
24090_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	As of January 1, 2017, we have discontinued sales of all of our domestic life insurance products that are not compliant with Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code.
24090_17_ITEM1_P45_S1	Sales of these domestic life insurance products are not material to premium income.
24090_17_ITEM1_P45_S2	We are currently developing compliant products to be sold in the domestic market.
24090_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our domestic Home Service segment operates in this market through our subsidiaries Security Plan Life Insurance Company ("SPLIC"), Magnolia Guaranty Life Insurance Company ("MGLIC") and Security Plan Fire Insurance Company ("SPFIC"), and focuses on the life insurance needs of the middle and lower income markets, primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	Our policies are sold and serviced through a home service marketing distribution system of approximately 333 employee-agents who work on a route system and through over 286 funeral homes and independent agents to sell policies, collect premiums and service policyholders.
24090_17_ITEM1_P46_S2	To a lesser extent, our Home Service segment sells limited-liability, named peril property policies covering dwelling and contents.
24090_17_ITEM1_P46_S3	In 2016 , our Home Service segment comprised 24%, or $47.5 million of our total direct premiums.
24090_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our home service insurance products consist primarily of small face amount ordinary whole life and pre-need policies, which are designed to fund final expenses for the insured, primarily consisting of funeral and burial costs.
24090_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	The average life insurance policy face amount issued was approximately $6,600 in 2016 ; therefore, the underwriting performed on these applications is limited.
24090_17_ITEM1_P47_S2	Our property coverages are limited to $30,000 maximum coverage on any one dwelling and contents, while content-only coverage and dwelling-only coverage is limited to $20,000 .
24090_17_ITEM1_P47_S3	We face competition in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas from other companies specializing in home service distribution of insurance.
24090_17_ITEM1_P47_S4	We seek to compete based upon our emphasis on personal service to our customers.
24090_17_ITEM1_P47_S5	We intend to continue premium growth within this segment via direct sales and acquisitions.
24090_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	Other Non-insurance Enterprises includes Computing Technology, Inc., which provides data processing services to the Company, and Insurance Investors, Inc., which provides aviation transportation to the Company, though the Company-owned airplane is not being used and is for sale.
24090_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	This segment also includes the results of Citizens, Inc., the parent Company.
24090_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our administrative operations principally serve our life insurance segment and are conducted primarily at our executive offices in Austin, Texas through approximately 134 administrative, operating and underwriting personnel.
24090_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our Home Service operations are conducted to a large degree from our district offices in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, as well as our service center in Donaldsonville, Louisiana.
24090_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	At our executive offices, we also perform policy design, marketing oversight, underwriting, accounting and reporting, actuarial, customer service, claims processing, administrative and investing activities.
24090_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	We have a single integrated system for our entire Company, which is a centrally-controlled, mainframe-based administrative system.
24090_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	Functions of our policy administrative system include policy set up, administration, billing and collections, commission calculation, valuation, automated data edits, storage backup, image management and other related functions.
24090_17_ITEM1_P51_S2	Each company we acquire is ultimately converted onto our administrative system.
24090_17_ITEM1_P51_S3	This system has been in place for more than 30 years and has been updated on an ongoing basis, as technology has evolved.
24090_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	We are currently reviewing technology options to transition from our legacy administration system to an upgraded, modernized technology platform that will service our needs into the future.
24090_17_ITEM1_P52_S1	On February 1, 2017, we went live with a modernized claims system.
24090_17_ITEM1_P52_S2	We are also currently converting our actuarial valuation from a third party service provider to an actuarial valuation modeling software system purchased from a vendor.
24090_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	The Company has an enterprise risk management function ( ERM ) that is charged with providing analyses of the Company s risks on an individual and aggregated basis and with ensuring that the Company s risks remain within its risk appetite and tolerances.
24090_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	The Company's focus on ERM strengthens its risk management culture and discipline.
24090_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	The mission of ERM is to support the Company in achieving its strategic priorities by:
24090_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	Providing insight to assist in growing the businesses and achieving optimal risk-adjusted returns within established guidelines.
24090_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	Effective risk oversight is an important priority for the Company s Board of Directors and senior management team.
24090_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	While it is the job of the CEO and senior management to assess and manage the Company risk exposure through ERM, in accordance with NYSE requirements, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is charged with discussing guidelines and policies to govern the process by which ERM is handled.
24090_17_ITEM1_P56_S2	The Audit Committee periodically discusses the Company s major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures.
24090_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	The categories of risk exposures assessed and managed by senior management include, but are not limited to:
24090_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	Any other risk that poses a material threat to the strategic viability of the Company.
24090_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	In addition to the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee considers the risks and rewards that may be implicated by our executive compensation philosophy and programs, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees the Company s governance practices, director succession and committee composition and leadership to manage risks associated with corporate governance.
24090_17_ITEM1_P59_S1	Although risk oversight is conducted primarily through committees of the Board, the full Board has retained responsibility for general oversight of risks.
24090_17_ITEM1_P59_S2	The Board satisfies this responsibility through full reports by each committee chair regarding the committees considerations and actions, as well as through regular reports directly from officers responsible for oversight of particular risks within the Company.
24090_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	Our U.S. insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations.
24090_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	State insurance laws establish supervisory agencies with broad regulatory authority to regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of each state in which they are licensed.
24090_17_ITEM1_P60_S2	In addition, U.S. laws, such as the USA Patriot Act of 2001, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("the Dodd-Frank Act"), are examples of U.S. regulations that affect our business.
24090_17_ITEM1_P60_S3	We are subject to comprehensive regulations under the USA Patriot Act and the Bank Secrecy Act with respect to money laundering, as well as federal regulations regarding privacy and confidentiality.
24090_17_ITEM1_P60_S4	Our insurance products and thus our businesses also are affected by U.S. federal, state and local tax laws.
24090_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act focuses on financial reform and has resulted in changes to the regulation of institutions operating in the financial services industry, including the Company.
24090_17_ITEM1_P61_S1	Its requirements include streamlining the state-based regulation of reinsurance and non-admitted insurance (also known as surplus lines insurance, which is property or casualty insurance written by a company that is not licensed to sell policies of insurance in a given state) and establishing a new Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury with powers over all lines of insurance except health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance.
24090_17_ITEM1_P61_S2	The Federal Insurance Office is authorized to, among other things, gather data and information to monitor aspects of the insurance industry, identify issues in the regulation of insurers about insurance matters and preempt state insurance measures under certain circumstances.
24090_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	significant rulemaking across numerous federal agencies, some of which has been implemented.
24090_17_ITEM1_P62_S1	The rulemaking process going forward may change with the new presidential administration.
24090_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	We are currently unable to determine the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources.
24090_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	The purpose of the laws and regulations that affect our insurance business is primarily to protect our insureds and not our stockholders.
24090_17_ITEM1_P64_S1	Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations.
24090_17_ITEM1_P64_S2	In addition, insurance regulatory authorities (including state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general) periodically make inquiries and regularly conduct examinations regarding compliance by us and our subsidiaries with insurance, and other laws and regulations regarding the conduct of our insurance businesses.
24090_17_ITEM1_P64_S3	We cooperate with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action when warranted.
24090_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are collectively licensed to transact business in 32 states.
24090_17_ITEM1_P65_S1	We have insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the states of Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.
24090_17_ITEM1_P65_S2	Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are licensed and regulated in all U.S. jurisdictions in which they conduct insurance business.
24090_17_ITEM1_P65_S3	The extent of this regulation varies, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations based upon the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) model rules governing the financial condition of insurers, including standards of solvency, types and concentration of investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, credit for reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy, and the business conduct of insurers, including marketing and sales practices and claims handling.
24090_17_ITEM1_P65_S4	In addition, statutes and regulations usually require the licensing of insurers and their agents, the approval of policy forms and related materials and the approval of rates for certain types of insurance products.
24090_17_ITEM1_P66_S0	All U.S. jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries conduct insurance business have enacted legislation that requires each U.S. insurance company in a holding company system, except captive insurance companies, to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its jurisdiction of domicile and to furnish that regulatory authority financial and other information concerning the operations of, and the interrelationships and transactions among, companies within its holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system.
24090_17_ITEM1_P66_S1	These laws and regulations also regulate transactions between insurance companies and their parents and affiliates.
24090_17_ITEM1_P66_S2	Generally, these laws and regulations require that all transactions within a holding company system between an insurer and its affiliates be fair and reasonable and that the insurer's statutory capital and surplus following any transaction with an affiliate be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.
24090_17_ITEM1_P67_S0	Statutory surplus is the excess of admitted assets over the sum of statutory liabilities and capital.
24090_17_ITEM1_P67_S1	For certain types of agreements and transactions between an insurer and its affiliates, these laws and regulations require prior notification to, and non-disapproval or approval by, the insurance regulatory authority of the insurer's jurisdiction of domicile.
24090_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	Generally, all foreign countries in which we offer insurance products require a license or other authority to conduct insurance business in that country.
24090_17_ITEM1_P68_S1	Some of these countries also require that local regulatory authorities approve the terms of any insurance product sold to residents of that country.
24090_17_ITEM1_P68_S2	We have never qualified to do business in any foreign country and have never submitted our insurance policies issued to residents of foreign countries for approval by any foreign or domestic insurance regulatory agency.
24090_17_ITEM1_P68_S3	We sell our policies to residents of foreign countries using foreign independent marketing firms and independent consultants, and we rely on our independent consultants to comply with laws applicable to them in marketing our insurance products in their respective countries.
24090_17_ITEM1_P68_S4	We have undertaken a comprehensive compliance review of risks associated with the potential application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in foreign countries.
24090_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	The application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in foreign countries varies by country.
24090_17_ITEM1_P69_S1	There is a lack of uniform regulation, lack of clarity in certain regulations and lack of legal precedent in addressing circumstances similar to ours.
24090_17_ITEM1_P69_S2	The preliminary results of our compliance review have confirmed the previously disclosed risks related to foreign insurance laws associated with our current business model, at least in certain jurisdictions, as described in detail in Item 1A - Risk Factors - Risks Relating to our Business.
24090_17_ITEM1_P69_S3	Depending on the ultimate outcome of our ongoing compliance review, we may explore alternatives to our current business model in one or more jurisdictions, including withdrawing from a particular market.
24090_17_ITEM1_P69_S4	We cannot assure you that any of these laws, regulations, or application of them by foreign regulatory authorities, or any change in our business model, will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products through our independent marketing consultants and, in turn, on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1_P70_S0	The payment of dividends or other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by the insurance laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile.
24090_17_ITEM1_P70_S1	The laws and regulations of some of these jurisdictions also prohibit an insurer from declaring or paying a dividend except out of its earned surplus or require the insurer to obtain regulatory approval before it may do so.
24090_17_ITEM1_P70_S2	In addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employee or other services) if they determine such payment could be adverse to policyholders or insurance contract holders of the subsidiary.
24090_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled require that a controlling party obtain the approval of the insurance commissioner of the insurance company's jurisdiction of domicile prior to acquiring control of the insurer and may delay, deter or prevent a transaction our shareholders might consider desirable.
24090_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	Risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements are imposed on life and property and casualty insurance companies.
24090_17_ITEM1_P72_S1	The NAIC has established minimum capital requirements in the form of RBC.
24090_17_ITEM1_P72_S2	RBC factors the type of business written by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company's business to develop a minimum level of capital called "authorized control level risk-based capital" and compares this level to adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves.
24090_17_ITEM1_P72_S3	Should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk-based capital fall below 200%, a series of actions by the affected company would begin.
24090_17_ITEM1_P73_S0	Government actions under the new presidential administration and congress could significantly impact the regulations to which we are subject.
24090_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	As part of a comprehensive reform of financial services regulation known as the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress established an office within the federal government to collect information about the insurance industry, recommend standards, and represent the United States in dealing with foreign insurance regulators.
24090_17_ITEM1_P74_S1	There can be no assurances under the new presidential administration that the Dodd-Frank Act will remain intact in part or in whole and as such, we cannot predict the impact that potential changes could have on the insurance industry and the Company.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investing in our Company involves certain risks.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Set forth below are certain risks with respect to our Company.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Readers should carefully review these risks, together with the other information contained in this report.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties we have described in this report are not the only ones we face.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem not material, may also adversely affect our business.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Any of the risks discussed in this report or that are presently unknown or not material, if they were to actually occur, could result in a significant adverse impact on our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	References in the risk factors below to "we," "us," "our," "Citizens" and like terms relate to Citizens, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statement basis, unless specifically identified otherwise.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We operate our subsidiaries as separate and distinct entities with respect to corporate formalities.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The majority of our sales derive from residents of foreign countries and are subject to risks associated with political instability, currency control laws and foreign insurance laws.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	A significant loss of sales in these foreign markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The majority of our direct premiums, approximately 73% in 2016, are from foreign countries, primarily those in Latin America and the Pacific Rim.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	These sales are made through independent consultants who are located in these foreign countries.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of these countries have a history of political instability, including regime changes, political uprisings, currency fluctuations and anti-democratic or anti-U.S. policies.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	There is a risk that political instability in these countries could have a material adverse effect on the ability of people living in these countries to purchase our insurance policies or our ability to sell our policies in those countries through our independent consultants or otherwise.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Our Company s future sales and financial results depend upon avoiding significant regulatory restraints on receiving insurance policy applications and premiums from, and issuing insurance policies to, residents outside of the United States.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Currency control laws or other currency exchange restrictions in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our revenues by imposing restrictions on asset transfers outside of a country where our insureds reside.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies to U.S. dollars in certain countries could prevent our insureds in those countries from purchasing or paying premiums on our policies.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	There can be no assurance that such restrictions will not be imposed and that our revenues, results of operations and financial condition will not be materially adversely affected if they do occur.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We also face risks associated with the application of foreign laws to our sales of policies to residents in foreign countries.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Generally, all foreign countries in which we offer insurance products require a license or other authority to conduct insurance business in that country.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Some of these countries also require that local regulatory authorities approve the terms of any insurance product sold to residents of that country.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Traditionally, we have sought to address risks associated with the potential application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in our foreign markets by, among other things, not locating any of our offices or assets in foreign countries, selling policies only through independent consultants rather than our own employees, requiring that all applications for insurance be submitted to and accepted only in our offices in the U.S., and requiring that policy premiums be paid to us only in U.S. Dollars.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We rely on our independent consultants to comply with laws applicable to them in marketing our insurance products in their respective countries.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We have undertaken a comprehensive compliance review of risks associated with the potential application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in foreign countries.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in foreign countries varies by country.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	There is a lack of uniform regulation, lack of clarity in certain regulations and lack of legal precedent addressing circumstances similar to ours.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	The preliminary results of our compliance review have confirmed the previously disclosed risks related to foreign insurance laws associated with our current business model, at least in certain foreign countries.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	There are risks that a foreign government could determine under its existing laws that its residents may not purchase life insurance from us unless we become qualified to do business in that country or unless our policies purchased by its residents receive prior approval from its insurance regulators.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P10_S4	There also is a risk that foreign regulators may become more aggressive in enforcing any perceived violations of their laws and seek to impose monetary fines, criminal penalties, and/or order us to cease our sales in that jurisdiction.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P10_S5	There is no assurance that, if a foreign country were to deem our sales of policies in that country to require that we qualify to do business in that country or submit our policies for approval by that country s regulatory authorities, we would be able to, or would conclude that it is advisable to, comply with those requirements.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Any determination by a foreign country that we or our policy sales are subject to regulation under their laws, or any actions by a foreign country to enforce such laws more aggressively, could therefore have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell policies in that country and, in turn, on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P10_S7	Depending on the ultimate outcome of our compliance review, we may explore alternatives to our current business model in one or more jurisdictions, including withdrawing from a particular market.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Any disruption to the marketing and sale of our policies to residents of a foreign country, resulting from the action of foreign regulatory authorities or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our operating results and financial condition may be affected if the liabilities actually incurred differ, or if our estimates of those liabilities change, from the amounts we have reserved for in connection with the noncompliance of a portion of our life insurance policies with Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code and the failure of certain annuity contracts to qualify under Section 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We previously announced that we determined that a portion of the life and annuity insurance policies issued by our subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702 and 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") of 1986.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	To the extent that these policies had unreported income build-up, we may be liable to the IRS for failure to withhold taxes or to notify policyholders of their obligation to pay taxes directly to the IRS.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We have undertaken an analysis of our potential liability to the IRS arising from this matter, as well as other expenses we may incur to remediate (i.e., conform to the requirements of the IRS) certain previously issued domestic life insurance and annuity policies and to address any missed reporting for policies issued to non-U.S. citizens and have established a best estimate reserve of $ 14.4 million, net of tax as of December 31, 2016 for probable liabilities and expenses.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	The probability weighted range of financial estimates relative to this issue is $7.5 million to $44.8 million , net of tax.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P13_S4	This estimated range includes projected toll charges and fees payable to the IRS, as well as estimated increased payout obligations to current and former holders of non-compliant domestic life insurance policies expected to result from remediation of those policies.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P13_S5	The amount of our liabilities and expenses depends on a number of uncertainties, including the number of prior tax years for which we may be liable to the IRS, the number of domestic life insurance policies we will be required to remediate, the methodology applicable to the calculation of taxable benefits under non-compliant policies and the amount of time and resources we will require from external advisors who are assisting us with resolving these issues.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Given the range of potential outcomes and the significant variables assumed in establishing our estimates, actual amounts incurred may exceed our reserve and also could exceed the high end of our estimated range of liabilities and expenses.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P13_S7	To the extent the amount reserved is insufficient to meet the actual amount of our liabilities and expenses, or if our estimates of those liabilities and expenses change in the future, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The Company currently expects to submit required filings with the IRS in 2017 to address all affected policies, though there can be no assurance that this process will be completed within this anticipated timeframe.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We face financial and capital market risks in our operations.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As an insurance holding company with significant investment exposure, we face material financial and capital markets risk in our operations.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Due to the low interest rate environment in recent years, we experienced significant call activity on our fixed income portfolio that decreased our investment yields compared to prior years.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We also have recorded other-than-temporary impairments in the past several years due to credit related market declines and equity market volatility.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Economic uncertainty has recently been exacerbated by the increased potential for default by one or more European sovereign debt issuers, the potential partial or complete dissolution of the Eurozone and its common currency, Brexit, potential changes in U.S. international trade policies and agreements and the negative impact of such events on global financial institutions and capital markets generally.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Actions or inactions of European governments may impact these actual or perceived risks.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Future actions or inactions of the United States government, including a shutdown of the federal government, could increase the actual or perceived risk that the U.S. may not ultimately pay its obligations when due and may disrupt financial markets.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Changes in market interest rates may significantly affect our profitability.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Some of our products, principally traditional whole life insurance with annuity riders, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our "spread," or the difference between the amounts we are required to pay under our contracts to policyholders and the rate of return we are able to earn on our investments intended to support obligations under the contracts.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our spread is an integral component of our net income.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	If interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured, prepaid, been sold, or called at lower yields, reducing our investment margin.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our fixed income bond portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk as a significant portion of the portfolio is callable.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Lowering interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in investment margins on some of our products.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	However, our ability to lower these rates could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates, and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	An increase in interest rates will increase the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio and may subject us to disintermediation risk.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Disintermediation risk is the risk that in a change from a low interest rate period to a significantly higher and increasing interest rate period, policyholders may surrender their policies or make early withdrawals in order to increase their returns, requiring us to liquidate investments in an unrealized loss position (i.e. the market value less the carrying value of the investments).
24090_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	This risk is discussed further in the two risk factors below.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Due to the sustained low interest rate environment, we re-priced certain products at the end of 2016 that result in lower potential investment returns for our customers, which is a key pricing assumption.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	This price increase could result in a decrease in sales that may negatively impact our revenues and profitability.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our investment portfolio is subject to various risks that may result in realized and unrealized investment losses.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In particular, decreases in the fair value of fixed maturities may significantly reduce the value of our investments, and as a result, our financial condition may suffer.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations under these securities could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in the recognition of investment losses.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the bonds included in our portfolio and by other factors that may result in the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In particular, at December 31, 2016 , fixed maturities represented $1,128.7 million or 92.4% of our total investments of $1,222.1 million .
24090_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The fair value of fixed maturities and the related investment income fluctuates depending on general economic and market conditions.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The fair value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us will generally increase or decrease in line with changes in market interest rates.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	An investment has prepayment risk when there is a risk that the timing of cash flows resulting from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	No similar adjustment is made for liabilities to reflect a change in interest rates.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Therefore, interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect our stockholders' equity, total comprehensive income and/or cash flows.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Although at December 31, 2016 , approximately 97.2% of our fixed maturities were investment grade with 78.2% rated A or above, all of our fixed maturities are subject to credit risk.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P29_S3	If any of the issuers of our fixed maturities suffer financial setbacks, the ratings on the fixed maturities could be downgraded (with a concurrent decrease in fair value) and, in a worst-case scenario, the issuer could default on its financial obligations.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P29_S4	If the issuer defaults, we could have realized losses associated with the impairment of the securities.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Valuation of our investments and the determination of whether a decline in the fair value of our invested assets is other-than-temporary are based on estimates that may prove to be incorrect.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P29_S6	U.S. GAAP requires that when the fair value of any of our invested assets declines and the decline is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we recognize a loss in either other comprehensive income or in our statement of income based on certain criteria in the period for which the determination is made.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The determination of the fair value of certain invested assets, particularly those that do not trade on a regular basis, requires an assessment of available data and the use of assumptions and estimates.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Once it is determined that the fair value of an asset is below its carrying value, we must determine whether the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, which is based on subjective factors and involves a variety of assumptions and estimates.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	There are risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in market value are other-than-temporary.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P30_S3	These include significant changes in general economic conditions and business markets, trends in certain industry segments, interest rate fluctuations, rating agency actions, changes in significant accounting estimates and assumptions and legislative actions.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In the case of mortgage- and asset-backed securities, there is added uncertainty as to the performance of the underlying collateral assets.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	To the extent that we are incorrect in our determination of the fair value of our investment securities or our determination that a decline in their value is other-than-temporary, we may realize losses that never actually materialize or may fail to recognize losses within the appropriate reporting period.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities may be realized or result in future impairments, resulting in a reduction in our net income.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and are, therefore, excluded from our net income.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Our total gross unrealized losses on our available-for-sale securities portfolio at December 31, 2016 were $ 9.4 million .
24090_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	The accumulated change in estimated fair value of these securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is realized upon sale of the security or in the event that the decline in estimated fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary and an impairment charge to earnings is taken.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Realized losses or impairments may have a material adverse effect on our net income in a particular quarterly or annual period.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, and we may be required to establish additional reserves, which in turn may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We maintain reserves to cover our estimated exposure for claims relating to our issued insurance policies.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Reserves, whether calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or statutory accounting practices prescribed by various state insurance regulators, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections, of what we expect claims will be based on mortality assumptions that are determined by various regulatory authorities.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Many reserve assumptions are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	In addition, when we acquire other domestic life insurance companies, our assessment of the adequacy of acquired policy liabilities is subject to our estimates and assumptions.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops, and adjustments to reserves are reflected in our statements of operations for the period in which such estimates are updated.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P36_S5	Because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, future developments may require us to increase policy benefit reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the periods in which such increases occur.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Unanticipated increases in early policyholder withdrawals or surrenders could negatively impact liquidity.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	A primary liquidity concern is the risk of unanticipated or extraordinary early policyholder withdrawals or surrenders.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Our insurance policies include provisions, such as surrender charges, that help limit and discourage early withdrawals, and we track and manage liabilities and attempt to align our investment portfolio to maintain sufficient liquidity to support anticipated withdrawal demands.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	consultants, changes in our claims-paying ability, or increases in surrenders among policies that have been in force for more than fifteen years and are no longer subject to surrender charges.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our liquidity, profitability and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	While we own a significant amount of liquid assets, a certain portion of investment assets are relatively illiquid.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	If we experience unanticipated early withdrawal or surrender activity, we could exhaust all other sources of liquidity and be forced to obtain additional financing or liquidate assets, perhaps on unfavorable terms.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the availability of credit in general or more specifically in the insurance industry, the strength or weakness of the capital markets, the volume of trading activities, our credit capacity, and the perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large realized or unrealized investment losses or if the level of business activity declines due to a market downturn.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P40_S3	If we are forced to dispose of assets on unfavorable terms, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Catastrophes may adversely impact liabilities for policyholder claims and reinsurance availability.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic events.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and man-made catastrophes may produce significant damage or loss of life in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Claims resulting from catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	In addition, catastrophic events could harm the financial condition of issuers of obligations we hold in our investment portfolio, resulting in impairments to these obligations, and the financial condition of our reinsurers, thereby increasing the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Large-scale catastrophes may also reduce the overall level of economic activity in affected countries, which could hurt our business and the value of our investments or our ability to sell new policies.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our life insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality, such as a pandemic or other event that causes a large number of deaths, especially if concentrated in our top foreign markets.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	A significant pandemic could have a major impact on the global economy or the economies of particular countries or regions, including travel, trade, tourism, the health system, food supply, consumption, overall economic output and, eventually, on the financial markets.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	In addition, a pandemic that affected our employees, our policyholders, our independent consultants or other companies with which we do business could disrupt our business operations.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P44_S3	The effectiveness of external parties, including governmental and non-governmental organizations, in combating the spread and severity of such a pandemic could have a material impact on the losses experienced by us.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P44_S4	These events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the costs of customer relationships acquired, which would increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	At December 31, 2016 , we had $167.8 million of deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	DAC represents costs that vary with and are primarily related to the successful sale and issuance of our insurance policies and are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P46_S2	These costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions, solicitation and printing costs, sales material costs and some support costs, such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Under U.S. GAAP, DAC is amortized to income over the lives of the underlying policies, in relation to the premium-paying period of the policies.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	In addition, when we acquire a block of insurance policies, we assign a portion of the purchase price to the right to receive future net cash flows from existing insurance and investment contracts and policies.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	This intangible asset, called the cost of customer relationships acquired, or CCRA, represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	At December 31, 2016 , we had $19.4 million of CCRA.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P48_S3	We amortize the value of this intangible asset in a manner similar to the amortization of DAC.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our recoverability of DAC and CCRA generally depends upon anticipated profits from investments, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, persistency and maintenance expense margins.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	For example, if our insurance policy lapse and surrender rates were to exceed the assumptions upon which we priced our insurance policies, or if actual persistency proves to be less than our persistency assumptions, especially in the early years of a policy, we might be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	to determine if they are recoverable from future income.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	If these costs are not recoverable, the amount that is not recoverable is charged to expenses in the financial period in which we make this determination.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses, investment returns, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, lapses or persistency may cause us to increase the amortization of DAC or CCRA, or both, or to record a current period expense to increase benefit reserves, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We may be required to recognize an impairment on the value of our goodwill, which would increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the amount paid by us to acquire various life insurance companies over the fair value of their net assets at the date of the acquisition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Under U.S. GAAP, we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the "reporting unit" level, which is either an operating segment or a business that is one level below the operating segment.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Goodwill is impaired if its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P54_S2	This may occur for various reasons, including changes in actual or expected earnings or cash flows of a reporting unit, generation of earnings by a reporting unit at a lower rate than similar businesses or declines in market prices for publicly traded businesses similar to our reporting units.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P54_S3	If any portion of our goodwill becomes impaired, we would be required to recognize the amount of the impairment as a current-period expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P54_S4	Goodwill in our consolidated financial statements was $17.3 million as of December 31, 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Due to changes in certain accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) which become effective for the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2019 (subject to early adoption), all or a portion of the $4.6 million in goodwill value of our Home Services segment may become impaired.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	The impairment methodology within the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ("ASC 350") follows a quantitative two step process.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	In the first step of the goodwill impairment test, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	In the second step, the Company performs a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure impairment.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	If the hypothetical purchase price allocation of the reporting unit is lower than the goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that difference.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Management s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations based on assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	In 2016, the Company's Home Service Segment failed the first step and thus the second impairment step had to be performed.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The Company's Home Service Segment passed step two, so the goodwill value for the Home Service Segment of $4.6 million was not impaired.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	An entity will no longer perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure impairment, eliminating step two.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Instead, impairment will be measured using the difference of the carrying amount to the fair value of the reporting unit.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P60_S3	The ASU is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods in fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2019, but early adoption is permitted for goodwill impairment tests with measurement dates after January 1, 2017.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	With the elimination of step two, there is risk that in the Home Service Segment all or a portion of the goodwill value could be impaired upon adoption of the ASU.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our conversion to a new actuarial valuation system is not yet complete and contains known uncertainties that could result in identification of additional errors in our financial reporting.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	As discussed in Note 1 - Correction of Immaterial Errors and Reclassification of Certain Amounts to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is in the process of converting its actuarial valuation from a third party service provider to an actuarial valuation modeling software system purchased from a vendor.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	In connection with our ongoing actuarial valuation conversion, certain legacy system errors were discovered.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P64_S1	As of December 31, 2016, the known errors have been quantified by the Company.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The errors in valuing DAC and future policy benefits caused the Company to understate amortization of DAC over several years and to overstate the increase in future policy benefit reserves during the same periods, resulting in an overstatement of DAC of $0.3 million and an overstatement of future policy benefits of $7.9 million at December 31, 2015.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P65_S1	The cumulative errors have been corrected through retained earnings as of January 1, 2014, the earliest period presented, with an increase to retained earnings of $3.4 million .
24090_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	As part of this conversion, the Company could identify additional differences that will be evaluated in future periods for financial reporting purposes.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P66_S1	The conversion to the new system is expected to be completed in 2017.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We are a defendant in lawsuits, which may adversely affect our financial condition and detract from the time our management is able to devote to our business, and we are subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory matters.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	From time to time we are, and have been, subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions and investigations relating to our business operations, including, but not limited to:
24090_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	disputes with our independent marketing firms, independent consultants and employee-agents over compensation, termination of contracts, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations and related claims; disputes regarding our tax liabilities; disputes relating to reinsurance and coinsurance agreements; and disputes relating to businesses acquired and operated by us.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	In the absence of countervailing considerations, we would expect to defend any such claims vigorously.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P70_S1	However, in doing so, we could incur significant defense costs, including attorneys' fees, other direct litigation costs and the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Further, if we suffer an adverse judgment as a result of any claim, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	A number of U.S. jurisdictions have been investigating life insurer practices for compliance with unclaimed property laws.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Highly publicized incidents disclosed the practice by certain companies of using data available on the U.S. Social Security Administration's Death Master File or a similar database in order to avoid paying periodic benefits under annuity contracts, but not using the same data base to determine when death benefits were owed.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P71_S2	This asymmetric conduct by certain insurers has led a number of jurisdictions to require life insurers to use this same data to identify instances where amounts under life insurance policies and annuity contracts are payable and to locate and pay beneficiaries under such contracts.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The National Conference of Insurance Legislators ("NCOIL") has adopted the Model Unclaimed Life Insurance Benefits Act ("Model Act") and several states have adopted legislation that is substantially similar to the Model Act adopted by NCOIL.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P72_S1	The Model Act imposes new requirements on insurers to periodically compare their in force life insurance and annuity policies against the Death Master File, investigate any identified matches to confirm the death of the insured and determine whether benefits are due and attempt to locate the beneficiaries or, if no beneficiary can be located, escheat the policy benefit to the respective state government as unclaimed property.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P72_S2	The Model Act could result in additional payments to beneficiaries, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws, and/or administrative penalties.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P72_S3	It is also possible that life insurers may be subject to claims regarding their business practices as a result given the legal uncertainty in this area.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P72_S4	However, court decisions in West Virginia and Florida have upheld the well-established insurance law principal that life insurance policies are not due and payable until the insurance company receives due proof of death, and have further held an insurance company has no duty to search the Death Master File or other databases to determine whether deaths have occurred that have not been reported to the company.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Despite the fact we have no history of the asymmetric conduct in question, we have received notices from the Louisiana Department of Treasury, the Arkansas Auditor of State and the Texas State Comptroller, indicating they intend to audit Citizens, Inc. and certain of its affiliates for compliance with unclaimed property laws.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P73_S1	The audits may result in additional payments to beneficiaries, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws, administrative penalties, interest, and changes to our Company's procedures for the identification and escheatment of abandoned property.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P73_S2	At this time, our Company is not able to estimate any of these possible amounts.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Reinsurers with which we do business could increase their premium rates and may not honor their obligations, leaving us liable for the reinsured coverage.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We reinsure certain risks underwritten by our various insurance subsidiaries.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P75_S2	The high cost of reinsurance or lack of affordable coverage could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P76_S1	We may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities and, even if highly desirable or necessary, we may not be able to obtain replacement reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts or at rates economic to us.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P76_S2	If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling or unable to bear an increase in net exposures, we may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P76_S3	In addition, our reinsurance facilities may be canceled for new business, pursuant to their terms, upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including a change of control of our Company (generally defined as the acquisition of 10% or more of our voting equity securities) or the failure of our insurance company subsidiaries to maintain the minimum required levels of statutory surplus.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P76_S4	Any of these potential developments could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	In 2016 , we reinsured $522.8 million of the face amount of our life insurance policies.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Amounts reinsured in 2016 represented 10.5% of the face amount of direct life insurance in force in that year.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Although the cost of reinsurance is, in some cases, reflected in premium rates, under certain reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer may increase the rate it charges us for reinsurance.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P78_S1	If our cost of reinsurance were to increase, we might not be able to recover these increased costs, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P78_S2	See Note 5 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Our international and domestic markets face significant competition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P79_S1	If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, our business, results of operations and profitability may be adversely affected.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Our international marketing plan focuses on making available U.S. Dollar-denominated life insurance products to individuals residing in more than 30 countries.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P80_S1	New competition could increase the supply of available insurance, which could adversely affect our ability to price our products at attractive profitable rates and thereby adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P80_S2	Existing barriers to entry in the foreign markets we serve may not be sufficient to impede potential competitors from entering such markets.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P80_S3	In connection with our business with foreign nationals, we experience competition primarily from the following sources, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have:
24090_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Foreign operated companies with U.S. Dollar-denominated policies.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We face direct competition from companies that operate in the same manner as we operate in our international markets.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Companies foreign to the countries in which their policies are sold but that issue local currency policies.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Another group of our competitors in the international marketplace consists of companies that are foreign to the countries in which their policies are sold but issue life insurance policies denominated in the local currencies of those countries.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Local currency policies provide the benefit of assets located in the country of foreign residents, but entail risks of uncertainty due to local currency fluctuations, as well as the perceived instability and weakness of local currencies.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Locally operated companies with local currency policies.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P85_S1	We compete with companies formed and operated in the country in which our foreign insureds reside.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P85_S2	Generally, these companies are subject to risks of currency fluctuations, and they primarily use mortality tables based on experience of the local population as a whole.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P85_S3	These mortality tables are typically based on significantly shorter life spans than those we use.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P85_S4	As a result, the cost of insurance from these companies tends to be higher than ours.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P85_S5	Although these companies typically market their policies to a broader section of the population than do our independent marketing firms and independent consultants, there can be no assurance that these companies will not endeavor to place a greater emphasis on our target market and compete more directly with us.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P86_S0	In the United States, we compete with more than 800 other life insurance companies of various sizes.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P87_S0	The life insurance business in the United States is highly competitive, in part because it is a mature industry that, in recent years, has experienced little to no growth in life insurance sales.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Many domestic life insurance companies have substantially greater financial resources, longer business histories, larger sales forces and more diversified lines of insurance coverage than we do.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P88_S0	States has also increased recently because the life insurance industry is consolidating, with larger, more efficient organizations emerging from the consolidation.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P89_S0	In addition, from time to time, companies enter and exit the markets in which we operate, thereby increasing competition at times when there are new entrants.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P89_S1	We may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices, or for other reasons.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P90_S0	There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in any of our markets.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P90_S1	If we do not, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Sales of our insurance products may be reduced if we are unable to (i) establish and maintain commercial relationships with independent marketing firms and independent consultants, (ii) attract and retain employee agents or (iii) develop and maintain our distribution sources.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P92_S0	We distribute our insurance products through several distribution channels, including independent marketing firms, independent consultants and our employee agents.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P92_S1	These relationships are significant for both our revenues and our profits.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P92_S2	In our life insurance segment, we depend almost exclusively on the services of independent marketing firms and independent consultants.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P92_S3	In our home service insurance segment, we depend on employee agents whose role in our distribution process is integral to developing and maintaining relationships with policyholders.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Significant competition exists among insurers in attracting and maintaining marketers of demonstrated ability.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Some of our competitors may offer better compensation packages for marketing firms, independent consultants and agents and broader arrays of products and have a greater diversity of distribution resources, better brand recognition, more competitive pricing, lower cost structures and greater financial strength or claims paying ratings than we do.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P93_S2	We compete with other insurers for marketing firms, independent consultants and employee agents primarily on the basis of our compensation and support services.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P93_S3	Any reduction in our ability to attract and retain effective sales representatives could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P94_S0	As of January 1, 2017, we have discontinued sales of all of our domestic life insurance products that are not compliant with Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P94_S1	We are currently developing compliant products to be sold in the domestic market.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P94_S2	We expect 2017 sales to decline due to lack of compliant products to sell and we are unsure of the impact this will have on our domestic distribution sources.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P94_S3	There may be adverse tax, legal or financial consequences if our sales representatives are determined not to be independent contractors.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Our sales representatives are independent contractors who operate their own businesses.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Although we believe that we have properly classified our representatives as independent contractors, there is nevertheless a risk that the IRS, foreign agency, a court or other authority will take the different view that our sales representatives should be treated like employees.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P95_S2	Furthermore, the tests governing the determination of whether an individual is considered to be an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact-sensitive and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification of independent sales representatives are subject to change or interpretation.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P96_S1	If there is a change in the manner in which our independent contractors are classified or an adverse determination with respect to some or all of our independent contractors by a court or governmental agency, we could incur significant costs in complying with such laws and regulations, including in respect of tax withholding, social security payments, government and private pension plan contributions and recordkeeping, or we may be required to modify our business model, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P96_S2	In addition, there is the risk that we may be subject to significant monetary liabilities arising from fines or judgments as a result of any such actual or alleged non-compliance with applicable federal, state, local or foreign laws.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Changes among our board and senior management team, or the failure to fill key vacancies or effectively manage succession, could hinder our operations, marketing and business strategy and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or prospects.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P98_S0	M. Kolander as our Chief Executive Officer; and the appointments in 2017 of a new Chief Operating Officer and two new independent directors.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P98_S1	The effectiveness of new leaders in these roles, and further transition as a result of these changes, could have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P98_S2	We rely on our senior executive team comprised of Chief Executive Officer Geoffrey M. Kolander (age 41), President Kay E. Osbourn (age 50) and Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer David S. Jorgensen (age 53) to develop and execute our operating and marketing plans and strategy for expanding our business.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P98_S3	We anticipate that their expertise will continue to be of substantial value in connection with our business and compliance strategies.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P98_S4	The loss of the services of any of these individuals, or the failure to effectively manage succession or fill key vacancies for an extended period of time, could have a significant adverse effect on our business and prospects.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Historically, our compensation philosophy focused primarily on cash compensation and excluded equity incentive compensation, employment agreements, change of control agreements or other compensation components that are common among similar publicly traded companies.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P99_S1	While we recently entered into employment and change of control agreements with our top three executives, the agreements still provide only for cash compensation, and there is no assurance that these executives will complete the term of their employment agreements or that the Company will renew the agreements upon expiration.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P99_S2	Our ability to retain and effectively incentivize our key executives and our ability to attract directors and new executive talent in the competitive insurance industry may be limited.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P99_S3	Further, we do not carry key-man insurance policies on any of their lives.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P100_S0	We are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the United States, which is subject to change and may increase our costs of doing business, restrict the conduct of our business and negatively impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P101_S0	We are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in U.S. jurisdictions where we do business, including state insurance regulations and U.S. federal securities, tax, financial services, privacy, anti-money laundering, bank secrecy, anti-corruption and foreign asset control laws.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Insurance company regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, with substantially lesser protections to shareholders of the regulated insurance companies.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P102_S1	To that end, all the states in which we do business have insurance regulatory agencies with broad legal powers with respect to licensing companies to transact business; mandating capital and surplus requirements; regulating trade and claims practices; approving policy forms; and restricting companies' ability to enter and exit markets.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P103_S0	The capacity for an insurance company's growth in premiums is partially a function of its required statutory surplus.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P103_S1	Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus, as measured by statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by a company's state of domicile, is considered important by all state insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P103_S2	Failure to maintain required levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action by regulatory authorities.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Most insurance regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant, renew, suspend and revoke licenses and approvals, and could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities, including acquisitions of other insurance companies, require us to add capital to our insurance company subsidiaries, or fine us.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P104_S1	If we are unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, or if our insurance business is determined not to comply fully with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations and their interpretations, including the USA Patriot Act, our revenues, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Although the U.S. federal government historically has not regulated the insurance business, legislation proposing federal regulation of insurance has been proposed from time to time and the Dodd-Frank Act enacted in 2010 expanded the federal presence in insurance oversight.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P105_S1	Its requirements include streamlining the state-based regulation of reinsurance and non-admitted insurance (also known as surplus lines insurance, which is property or casualty insurance written by a company that is not licensed to sell policies of insurance in a given state) and establishing a new Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury with powers over all lines of insurance except health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P105_S2	The Federal Insurance Office is authorized to, among other things, gather data and information to monitor aspects of the insurance industry, identify issues in the regulation of insurers about insurance matters and preempt state insurance measures under certain circumstances.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P106_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act calls for numerous studies and significant rulemaking across numerous federal agencies, some of which has been implemented.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P106_S1	The rulemaking process going forward may change with the new presidential administration.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P107_S0	We are currently unable to determine the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Our failure to maintain effective information systems could adversely affect our business.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P109_S0	If we do not maintain adequate systems, we could experience adverse consequences, including products acquired through acquisition, inadequate information on which to base pricing, underwriting and reserve decisions, regulatory problems, failure to meet prompt payment obligations, increases in administrative expenses and loss of customers.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Some of our information technology systems and software are mainframe-based, legacy-type systems that require an ongoing commitment of resources to maintain current standards.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P110_S1	Our systems utilize proprietary code requiring highly skilled personnel.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P110_S2	Due to the unique nature of our proprietary operating environment, we could have difficulty finding personnel with the skills required to provide ongoing system maintenance and development as we seek to keep pace with changes in our products and business models, information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and policyholder needs.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P110_S3	Our success is dependent upon, among other things, maintaining and enhancing the effectiveness of existing systems, as well as continuing to integrate, develop and enhance our information systems to support business processes in a cost-effective manner.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Failures of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, impair our ability to timely file reports with the SEC and subject us to litigation and/or regulatory scrutiny and penalties.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P113_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that we timely report information as specified in SEC rules and regulations.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P113_S1	We also maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P113_S2	However, these controls may not achieve, and in some cases have not achieved, their intended objectives.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P113_S3	Control processes that involve human diligence and compliance, such as our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, are subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P113_S4	Controls that rely on models may be subject to inadequate design or inaccurate assumptions or estimates.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P113_S5	Controls also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override of such controls.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P113_S6	Because of such limitations, there are risks that material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected, and that information may not be reported on a timely basis.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P113_S7	The failure of our controls to be effective could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the market for our common stock, and could subject us to litigation, regulatory scrutiny and/or penalties.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P114_S0	As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have identified control deficiencies in our disclosure controls and financial reporting process that constitute material weaknesses and for which remediation is still in process as of December 31, 2016.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P114_S1	If we fail to design effective controls, fail to remediate control deficiencies or fail to otherwise maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future, such failures could result in a material misstatement of our annual or quarterly financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and which could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements, have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock, limit our ability to obtain financing if needed or increase the cost of any financing we may obtain.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P114_S2	In addition, these failures may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, impair our ability to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, subject us to litigation and regulatory scrutiny and cause us to incur substantial additional costs in future periods relating to the implementation of remedial measures.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P115_S0	Our failure to protect confidential information and privacy could result in the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential corporate or customer information, damage to our reputation, loss of customers, fines, penalties and adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P116_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to privacy regulations.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P116_S1	The actions we take to protect confidential information include among other things: monitoring our record retention plans and policies and any changes in state or federal privacy and compliance requirements; maintaining secure storage facilities for tangible records; and limiting access to electronic information in order to safeguard certain information.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P117_S0	In addition, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires that we deliver a notice regarding our privacy policy both at the delivery of an insurance policy and annually thereafter.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Certain exceptions are allowed for sharing of information under joint marketing agreements.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P118_S1	However, certain state laws may require us to obtain a policyholder's consent before we share information.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P119_S0	We have a written information security program with appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect such confidential information.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P119_S1	Cyber security attacks are on the rise throughout the world and while we believe we have taken reasonable steps to secure our customer information we could experience a breach of data.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P120_S0	system, and we are not aware of any material breach of our cybersecurity, administrative, technical and physical safeguards or client data.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P120_S1	Nevertheless, it is possible a cyber attack could go undetected and that preventative actions we take to reduce this risk of cyber-incidents and protect our information may be insufficient to prevent cyber attacks or other security breaches.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P121_S0	If we do not comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information, we could experience adverse consequences, including regulatory sanctions, loss of reputation, litigation exposure, disruptions to our operations or significant technical, legal and operating expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P122_S0	General economic, financial market and political conditions may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P123_S0	Our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected from time to time by general economic, financial market and political conditions, both in the United States and in the foreign countries where our policyowners reside.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P123_S1	These conditions include economic cycles such as: levels of consumer spending; levels of inflation; movements of the financial markets; availability of credit; fluctuations in interest rates, monetary policy or demographics; and legislative and competitive changes.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P124_S0	During periods of economic downturn, our insureds may choose not to purchase our insurance products, may terminate existing policies, permit policies to lapse or may choose to reduce the amount of coverage purchased, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P124_S1	Also, our sales of new insurance policies might decrease.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by applicable laws and regulations in the amounts of fees, dividends and other distributions they may make to us.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P125_S1	The inability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us in sufficient amounts for us to conduct our operations could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations or expand our business.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P126_S0	As a holding company, our principal asset is the stock of our subsidiaries.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P126_S1	We rely primarily on statutorily permissible payments from our insurance company subsidiaries, principally through service agreements we have with our subsidiaries, to meet our working capital and other corporate expenses.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P126_S2	The ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to make payments to us is subject to regulation by the states in which they are domiciled, and these payments depend primarily on approved service agreements between us and these subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, the statutory surplus (which is the excess of assets over liabilities as determined under statutory accounting practices prescribed by an insurance company's state of domicile), future statutory earnings (which are earnings as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices) and regulatory restrictions.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P127_S0	Generally, the net assets of our insurance company subsidiaries available for dividends are limited to either the lesser or greater (depending on the state of domicile) of the subsidiary's net gain from operations during the preceding year and 10% of the subsidiary's net statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P128_S0	Except to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of our subsidiaries' creditors, including policyholders, have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors and shareholders.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P128_S1	If any of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates or otherwise reorganizes, our creditors and shareholders will have no right to proceed in their own right against the assets of that subsidiary or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of the subsidiary under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P129_S0	Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to debt and equity capital and our cost of capital in seeking to expand our business.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P130_S0	The availability of equity and debt financing to us will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit capacity, as well as the possibility that investors or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P130_S1	Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets may also limit our access to equity capital for us to seek to expand our business.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P130_S2	As such, we may be forced to delay raising debt or equity capital, or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could adversely affect our ability to seek any acquisitions and negatively impact profitability of an acquisition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P131_S0	Unexpected losses in future reporting periods may require us to adjust the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P132_S0	We evaluate our deferred tax asset ( DTA ) quarterly for recoverability based on available evidence.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P132_S1	This process involves management's judgment about assumptions, which are subject to change from period to period due to tax rate changes or variances between our projected operating performance and our actual results.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P132_S2	Ultimately, future adjustments to the DTA valuation allowance, if any, will be determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P133_S0	The realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry back or carry forward periods under applicable tax law.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P134_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we may be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P134_S1	Such an adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and capital position.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P135_S0	We face a greater risk of money laundering activity associated with sales derived from residents of certain foreign countries.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P136_S0	Some of our top international markets are in countries identified by the U.S. Department of State as jurisdictions of high risk for money laundering.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P137_S0	As required by Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA ) regulations applicable to insurance companies, we have developed and implemented an anti-money laundering program that includes policies and procedures for complying with applicable BSA program, reporting and recordkeeping requirements and for deterring, preventing and detecting potential money laundering and other criminal activity ( BSA Program ).
24090_17_ITEM1A_P137_S1	Based on a prior internal risk assessment, we have enhanced our BSA Program with additional controls, such as list screening software beyond sanctions screening required by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ( OFAC ), enhanced payment due diligence and transaction controls.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P137_S2	However, there can be no assurance that these enhanced controls will entirely mitigate money laundering risk associated with these jurisdictions.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P138_S0	If our foreign policyholders reduced or ceased participation in our Stock Investment Plan (the Plan ) or if a securities regulatory authority were to deem the Plan's operation contrary to securities laws, the volume of Class A common stock purchased on the open market through the Plan, and the price of our Class A common stock, could fall.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P139_S0	More than 95% percent of the shares of Class A common stock purchased under the Plan in 2016 were purchased by foreign holders of life insurance policies (or related brokers); the remaining 5% of the shares of Class A common stock purchased under the Plan in 2016 were purchased by approximately 2,123 participants resident in the United States.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P139_S1	The Plan is registered with the SEC pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, but is not registered under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P139_S2	If a foreign securities regulatory authority were to determine the offer and sale of our Class A common stock under the Plan were contrary to applicable laws and regulations of its jurisdiction, such authority may issue or assert a fine, penalty or cease and desist order against us in that foreign jurisdiction.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P139_S3	There is a risk our Class A common stock price could be negatively impacted by a decrease in participation in the Plan.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P139_S4	If fewer policyholders elect to participate in the Plan, or our international premium collections were to decrease as a result of regulatory, economic, or marketing impediments, the trading volume of our Class A common stock may decline from its present levels, the demand for our Class A common stock could be negatively impacted and the price of our Class A common stock could fall.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P140_S0	Control of our Company, through the ownership of our Class B Common Stock, may transfer from our founder to a 501(c)(3) charitable foundation established by our founder, and we cannot determine whether any change in our management, operations, or operating strategies will occur as a result of such an ownership change.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P141_S0	Harold E. Riley, our founder and Chairman Emeritus, is the beneficial owner of 100% of our Class B common stock, which is held in the name of the Harold E. Riley Trust ("Trust"), of which he serves as Trustee.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P141_S1	Our Class A and Class B common stock are identical in all respects, except the Class B common stock elects a simple majority of the Board and receives one-half of any cash dividends paid, on a per share basis, to the Class A shares.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P141_S2	Therefore, Mr. Riley controls our Company.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P141_S3	The Class A common stock elects the remainder of the Board.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P141_S4	The Trust documents provide that upon Mr. Riley's death, the Class B common stock will be transferred from the Trust to the Harold E. Riley Foundation, a charitable organization established under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Foundation").
24090_17_ITEM1A_P141_S5	The Foundation is organized as a public support charity for the benefit of its charitable beneficiaries, Baylor University and Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P141_S6	The Foundation is governed by 11 trustees, five of which are appointed by its sole member, Harold Riley, three of which are appointed by Baylor University and three of which are appointed by Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P141_S7	The trustees appointed by Harold Riley include himself, Dottie Riley and Rick Riley.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P141_S8	In addition, the Trust documents provide that Mr. Riley may at any time transfer the Class B common stock held by the Trust to the Foundation.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P141_S9	It is unclear what, if any, changes would occur to our board, management, or corporate operating strategies as a result of different ownership of our Class B common stock.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P141_S10	A transfer of our Class B common stock from the Trust also may trigger certain change in control provisions in the employment agreements of our top three executives.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P141_S11	Under each employment agreement, a change in control" includes, among other things (1) the transfer of at least a majority of the Company s Class B Common Stock from the Harold E. Riley Trust to an individual other than Harold E. Riley, an entity not beneficially owned by Harold E. Riley or a trust not controlled by Harold E. Riley and (2) the exercise of a power of attorney granted by Harold E. Riley over the Company s Class B Common Stock.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P142_S0	Upon a termination by Citizens without cause or the executive s voluntary termination with Good Reason, in each case other than within the ninety (90) day period prior to the consummation of a change in control or within one (1) year following a change in control, each executive is entitled to certain cash payments and benefits.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P143_S0	There are a substantial number of our shares of Class A common stock issued to our executive officers and directors which are eligible for future sale in the public market.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P143_S1	The sale of these shares could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fall.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P144_S0	There were 49,080,114 shares of our Class A common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM1A_P144_S1	Our executive officers and directors owned approximately 2,480,354 shares of our Class A common stock as of December 31, 2016 , representing approximately 5.0% of our then outstanding Class A common stock.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P144_S2	Almost all of these shares have been registered for public resale and generally may be sold freely.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P144_S3	In the event of a sale of some or all of these shares or the perceived sale of these shares, the market price of our Class A common stock could fall substantially.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P145_S0	The price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P146_S0	Our Class A common stock price has historically fluctuated and is likely to fluctuate in the future and could decline materially because of the volatility of the stock market in general, decreased participation in the Plan referred to above or a variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: quarterly or annual variations in actual or anticipated results of our operations; interest rate fluctuations; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; competition and other factors affecting the life insurance business generally; and conditions in the U.S. and world economies.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P147_S0	Our international markets, and the specific manner in which we conduct our business in those jurisdictions, may be subject to negative publicity in social media or other channels, which may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P148_S0	We interface with and distribute our products to residents of foreign countries that may be subject to the risks disclosed in our Item 1A. Risk Factor under the heading, The majority of our sales derive from residents of foreign countries and are subject to risks associated with widespread political instability, currency control laws and foreign insurance laws.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P148_S1	A significant loss of sales in these foreign markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition".
24090_17_ITEM1A_P148_S2	Accordingly, from time to time, bloggers or other social media outlets relevant to investors may focus attention on our exposure to these countries and the negative circumstances surrounding their governments, thereby subjecting us to periodic negative publicity.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P148_S3	Negative publicity on investor blogs or through other media channels could impact trading in our stock and ultimately cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fall.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P149_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as applicable state insurance laws, may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P150_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as various state insurance laws, may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a takeover attempt our shareholders might consider in their best interests.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P150_S1	As a result, our shareholders will be prevented from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our Class A common stock that may be offered by a bidder in a takeover context.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P150_S2	Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P151_S0	The following provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws make it difficult for our Class A shareholders to replace or remove our directors and have other anti-takeover effects that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt:
24090_17_ITEM1A_P152_S0	our board of directors may issue one or more series of preferred stock without the approval of our shareholders.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P153_S0	State insurance laws generally require prior approval of a change in control of an insurance company.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P153_S1	Generally, such laws provide that control over an insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the insurer.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P154_S0	In considering an application to acquire control of an insurer, an insurance commissioner generally will consider such factors as the experience, competence and financial strength of the proposed acquirer, the integrity of the proposed acquirer's board of directors and executive officers, the proposed acquirer's plans for the management and operation of the insurer, and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the acquisition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P154_S1	In addition, a person seeking to acquire control of an insurance company is required in some states to make filings prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and the target insurance company and their affiliates have sufficiently large market shares in particular lines of insurance in those states.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P154_S2	These state insurance requirements may delay, deter or prevent our ability to complete an acquisition.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P155_S0	We have never paid any cash dividends on our Class A common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P156_S0	We have never paid cash dividends on our Class A common stock, as it is our policy to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business.
24090_17_ITEM1A_P156_S1	We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
24090_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	We own our principal office in Austin, Texas, consisting of an 80,000 square foot office building in addition to approximately one acre of land nearby that houses storage facilities.
24090_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	Approximately 50,000 square feet is occupied or reserved for our operations.
24090_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also own a training facility at Lake Buchanan, Texas.
24090_17_ITEM2_P0_S3	In addition, we own other properties in Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana that are incidental to our operations.
24090_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	On or about March 16, 2017, Juan Gamboa filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and five of its current and former directors and executive officers in the United States District Court, Western District of Texas.
24090_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	The lawsuit alleges the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by making false and/or misleading statements, as well as failing to disclose material adverse facts about the Company s business, operations and prospects.
24090_17_ITEM3_P0_S2	The complaint seeks an award of damages in an unspecified amount on behalf of a putative class consisting of persons who purchased the Company s common stock between March 11, 2015 and March 8, 2017, inclusive.
24090_17_ITEM3_P0_S3	The Company believes that the lawsuit is without merit, and it intends to vigorously defend against all claims asserted.
24090_17_ITEM3_P0_S4	At this time, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the outcome of this litigation.
24090_17_ITEM3_P1_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various legal and regulatory actions which are immaterial to the Company's financial statements.
24090_17_ITEM3_P2_S0	our management is able to devote to our business, and we are subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory matters.
24090_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol CIA.
24090_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	Quarterly high and low closing prices per share of our Class A common stock as reported by the NYSE are shown below.
24090_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	The number of stockholders on record on April 19, 2017 was as follows:
24090_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	We have never paid cash dividends on our Class A or B common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
24090_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	We did not purchase any of our equity securities during any quarter in 2014 , 2015 or 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM5_P5_S0	We do not maintain any equity compensation plans or arrangements.
24090_17_ITEM5_P5_S1	Thus, we do not have any securities authorized for issuance under these types of plans, nor have we issued any options, warrants or similar instruments to purchase any of our equity securities.

24090_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following is management's discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations of the Company.
24090_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	It is intended to be a discussion of certain key financial information regarding the Company and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes to this report on Form 10-K.
24090_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	We conduct operations as an insurance holding company emphasizing ordinary life insurance and endowment products in niche markets where we believe we can achieve competitive advantages.
24090_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	As an insurance provider, we collect premiums on an ongoing basis to pay future benefits to our policy and contract holders.
24090_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company derives its revenues principally from 1) premiums earned for insurance coverages provided to insureds; 2) net investment income; and 3) net realized capital gains and losses.
24090_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Profitability of our insurance operations depends heavily upon the Company s underwriting discipline, as we seek to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, management of claims, use of reinsurance, sizing of our in force block, careful monitoring of our mortality and morbidity experience, and management our expense ratio, which we accomplish through economies of scale and management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses.
24090_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future losses based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the Company s response to competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels.
24090_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Company seeks to price our insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin.
24090_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	The Company repriced its top six selling international products at the end of 2016 to increase profitability.
24090_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	Because the products are more expensive for potential policyholders, the Company is closely monitoring sales trends.
24090_17_ITEM7_P5_S3	The Company has the ability to adjust dividend scales and interest crediting rates at its discretion based on economic and other factors.
24090_17_ITEM7_P5_S4	The profitability of fixed annuities, riders and other spread-based product features depends largely on the Company s ability to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on assets and interest credited to policyholders.
24090_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	The investment return, or yield, on invested assets is an important element of the Company s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before benefits are paid.
24090_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	The majority of the Company s invested assets have been held in fixed maturities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, primarily in asset classes of corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and government obligation bonds.
24090_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	The interest rate environment has a significant impact on the determination of insurance contract liabilities, our investment rates and yields and our asset/liability management.
24090_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	The primary investment objective for the Company is to maximize economic value, consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including the management of credit risk and interest rate sensitivity of invested assets, while generating sufficient after-tax income to meet policyholder and corporate obligations.
24090_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	The Company maintains a conservative investment strategy that may vary based on a variety of factors including business needs, regulatory requirements and tax considerations.
24090_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	We previously announced that we determined that a portion of the life and annuity insurance policies issued by our subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702 and 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") of 1986.
24090_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	To the extent that these policies had unreported income build-up, we may be liable to the IRS for failure to withhold taxes or to notify policyholders of their obligation to pay taxes directly to the IRS.
24090_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	million, net of tax as of December 31, 2016 for probable liabilities and expenses.
24090_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	The probability weighted range of financial estimates relative to this issue is $7.5 million to $44.8 million , net of tax.
24090_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	This estimated range includes projected toll charges and fees payable to the IRS, as well as estimated increased payout obligations to current and former holders of non-compliant domestic life insurance policies expected to result from remediation of those policies.
24090_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	The amount of our liabilities and expenses depends on a number of uncertainties, including the number of prior tax years for which we may be liable to the IRS, the number of domestic life insurance policies we will be required to remediate, the methodology applicable to the calculation of taxable benefits under non-compliant policies and the amount of time and resources we will require from external advisors who are assisting us with resolving these issues.
24090_17_ITEM7_P10_S4	Given the range of potential outcomes and the significant variables assumed in establishing our estimates, actual amounts incurred may exceed our reserve and also could exceed the high end of our estimated range of liabilities and expenses.
24090_17_ITEM7_P10_S5	To the extent the amount reserved is insufficient to meet the actual amount of our liabilities and expenses, or if our estimates of those liabilities and expenses change in the future, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
24090_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	The financial data for 2015 has been restated to correct accounting for policy benefit reserves, DAC and a legal expense accrual and the financial data used for 2014 has been restated to correct accounting for policy benefit reserves and DAC.
24090_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	See Note 1, Correction of Immaterial Errors and Reclassifications of Certain Amounts in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
24090_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our 2016 financial results are driven by our historical business management model and traditional life insurance product sales.
24090_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	Although interest rates have risen recently, the historically low interest rate environment continues to impact our results and our industry as investment yields are an integral component of our business operations.
24090_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Realized net investment losses resulted from other-than-temporary impairments ("OTTI") on investment securities which were recorded totaling $4.3 million and $5.4 million , in 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and are reported as realized losses.
24090_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	The OTTI in 2016 was somewhat offset by realized investment gains on sales of fixed maturity securities in our available-for-sale portfolio and sales of equity securities.
24090_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	During 2016 , claims and surrenders expense increased 3.2% from the comparable period in 2015 , primarily due to an increase in surrender benefits and matured endowments in the life segment compared to the 2015 levels.
24090_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	General expenses increased slightly and remained at relatively high levels due to the tax compliance issue noted above relating to product qualification under IRC section 7702 and 72(s) and remediation costs that have been identified, as well as increased consulting costs for actuarial, tax, and legal assistance.
24090_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	For over thirty-seven years, CICA and its predecessors have accepted policy applications from foreign nationals for U.S. Dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies.
24090_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	We make our insurance products available using third-party marketing organizations and independent marketing consultants.
24090_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Endowment product sales have been on the rise and represented approximately 77.1% of new sales in the life segment in 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	The Company currently offers a fifteen and twenty year endowment and our top selling endowment is a product that matures at age sixty-five.
24090_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	The Company repriced its top six selling international products at the end of 2016 to increase profitability.
24090_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Through the domestic market of our Life Insurance segment, we provide ordinary whole life, credit life insurance, and final expense policies to middle and lower income families and individuals in certain markets in the mountain west, mid-west and southern U.S.
24090_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	The majority of our domestic revenues are generated by the policies of domestic life insurance companies we have acquired since 1987.
24090_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	We provide final expense ordinary and industrial life insurance to middle and lower income individuals in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	Our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through a home service marketing distribution system utilizing employee-agents who work on a route system to collect premiums and service policyholders, and through networks of funeral homes that collect premiums and provide personal policyholder service.
24090_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Premiums in this segment increased slightly in 2016 compared to 2015 , as renewal premiums increased while first year premiums decreased slightly as the Home Service business is a mature business.
24090_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	This is the same trend we saw in 2015 compared to 2014 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Significant economic issues impacting our business and industry currently and into the future are discussed below.
24090_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Slow increases in the interest rate environment will limit increases in profit margins for insurers.
24090_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	We have been impacted by the historically low interest rate environment over the past several years as our fixed income investment portfolio, primarily invested in callable securities, has been reinvested at lower yields.
24090_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	The Company s conservative investment strategy has not changed but we have focused new purchases into holding of state, municipalities, essential service and corporate issuers compared to our historical investment in U.S. government holdings.
24090_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	Our investment earnings also impact the reserve and Deferred Acquisition Costs ( DAC ) balances, as assumptions are used in the development of the balances.
24090_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Due to the recent decline in investment yields on our portfolio, our projection of long-term investment returns has declined.
24090_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	This has resulted in increasing the reserves on policies issued in the current year, as well as reducing the DAC asset.
24090_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	As an increasing percentage of the world population reaches retirement age, we believe we will benefit from increased demand for living benefit products rather than death products, as customers will require cash accumulation to pay expenses to meet their lifetime income needs.
24090_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	Our ordinary life products are designed to accumulate cash values to provide for living expenses in a policy owner's later years, while continuously providing a death benefit.
24090_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	We believe there is a trend toward consolidation of domestic life insurance companies, due to significant losses incurred by the life insurance industry as a result of the credit crisis and related economic pressures, as well as increasing costs of regulatory compliance for domestic life insurance companies.
24090_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	We believe this trend should benefit our acquisition strategy as more complementary acquisition candidates may become available for us to consider.
24090_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Many of the events and trends affecting the life insurance industry have had an impact on the life reinsurance industry.
24090_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	These events have led to a decline in the availability of reinsurance.
24090_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	While we currently cede a limited amount of our primary insurance business to reinsurers, we may find it difficult to obtain reinsurance in the future, forcing us to seek reinsurers who are more expensive to us.
24090_17_ITEM7_P28_S3	If we cannot obtain affordable reinsurance coverage, either our net exposures will increase or we will have to reduce our underwriting commitments.
24090_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	While our management has extensive experience in writing life insurance policies for foreign residents, changes to foreign laws and regulations and their related application and enforcement, along with currency controls affecting our foreign resident insureds could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	On March 7, 2014, the Company acquired Magnolia Guaranty Life Insurance Company ("MGLIC") in the amount of $5.2 million.
24090_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	MGLIC is a Mississippi domiciled company that began writing business in 1992 and issues primarily industrial life policies through independent funeral homes in the state of Mississippi.
24090_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	We recorded $0.1 million of goodwill as a result of this transaction.
24090_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	MGLIC is reported in our home service segment.
24090_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	A discussion of consolidated results is presented below, followed by a discussion of Segment Operations and financial results by segment.
24090_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Insurance revenues are primarily generated from premium revenues and investment income.
24090_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	In addition, realized gains and losses on investment holdings can significantly impact revenues from year to year.
24090_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	Premium income derived from life, accident and health, and property insurance sales, increased 1.7% during 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	The increase resulted primarily from renewal premiums, which increased 2.7% and 5.1% in the life segment for 2016 and 2015 and totaled $168.3 million , $164.4 million and $157.8 million on the consolidated level in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
24090_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	New sales, termed as first year premiums, decreased 0.5% and 2.7% , and increased 13.2% in the life segment in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
24090_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Endowment sales represent a significant portion of new business sales internationally with the 20-year endowment and endowment to age 65 as our top products.
24090_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	In addition, most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision, which allows the policyholder to use cash value within a policy to pay premiums.
24090_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	The policy loan asset balance increased 10.8% and 11.4% in 2016 and 2015 , year over year.
24090_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Net investment income increased to $48.6 million in 2016 compared to $45.8 million in 2015 , as we experienced higher average invested assets as a result of investment of new premium revenue.
24090_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	Our yield on average invested assets decreased 10 basis points from 2015 to 2016 as it has been difficult to find investments in higher yielding securities with high credit quality.
24090_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Net investment income performance is summarized as follows.
24090_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	We have traditionally invested in fixed maturity securities with a large percent held in callable issues.
24090_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	The sustained low interest rate environment of the past several years is holding down yields.
24090_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	While U.S. Treasury interest rates have risen recently after a fairly significant decline during 2016, yields on high quality corporate and municipal securities have been slower to rise.
24090_17_ITEM7_P38_S3	The interest rate direction is uncertain but as market interest rates begin to rise, our call risk will diminish, resulting in our fixed securities maturing at the stated maturity dates and our portfolio yield will rise more slowly over time, as new money investments would be made at higher rates.
24090_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	Investment income from fixed maturity securities accounted for approximately 87.0% of total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	We have increased our investment purchases of corporate and municipal securities over the past several years, with no focus on any particular industry sectors in these security categories, but rather a focus on higher yielding securities.
24090_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	In addition, we currently have $17.1 million invested in equity securities related to bond and stock mutual funds as these securities offer a competitive yield with a shorter duration.
24090_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	However, we have reduced our holdings over the last several years due to higher earnings volatility and RBC charges.
24090_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Investment income from fixed maturity investments increased in 2016 due to an increase in the portfolio from new money investment purchases as noted above relative to the fixed maturity portfolio.
24090_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	In addition, the increase in the policy loans asset balance, which represents policyholders utilizing their accumulated policy cash value, contributed to the increase to investment income.
24090_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Investment income from equity securities has declined as we have reduced our holdings as discussed above.
24090_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Net realized investment losses resulted from OTTI on both fixed maturity and equity securities totaling $4.3 million and $5.4 million , in 2016 and 2015 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	The OTTI in 2016 was somewhat offset by realized investment gains on sales of fixed maturity securities in our available-for-sale portfolio and sales of equity securities.
24090_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Realized investment gains (losses) are as follows.
24090_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	As noted in the table below, claims, benefits and surrenders increased from $78.9 million in 2015 to $81.4 million in 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	The Company monitors death claims based upon expectations.
24090_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	These values may routinely fluctuate from year to year.
24090_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	We did experience several higher value claims in the life segment in the first quarter of 2015 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Endowment benefits decreased slightly in 2016 compared to 2015 amounts.
24090_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	We have a series of international policies that carry an immediate endowment benefit of an amount selected by the policy owner.
24090_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	These benefits have been popular in the Pacific Rim and Latin America, where the Company has experienced increased interest in our guaranteed products in recent years.
24090_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	Annual guaranteed endowments are factored into the premium and, as such, the increase or decrease is expected to have little impact on expected profitability.
24090_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	Matured endowments increased in each of the last two years and we expect this trend to continue as this block of business increases, persists and policies begin to reach maturity.
24090_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	Property claims increased 15% to approximately $1.9 million in 2016 compared with the amount reported for 2015 due to a slight increase in weather related claims.
24090_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	Other policy benefits resulted primarily from interest paid on premium deposits and policy benefit accumulations and increased as these policy liabilities also increased.
24090_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	The change in future policy benefit reserves has decreased in 2016 by 1.5% and in 2015 by 6.0% , primarily due to higher surrenders in each year.
24090_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	The Company issues long duration participating policies to foreign residents that are expected to pay dividends to policyholders based upon actual experience.
24090_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	Initially, policyholder dividend scales are factored into the guaranteed premiums at the time the product is developed, based on expected future experience and desired profit goals.
24090_17_ITEM7_P53_S2	As actual and expected experience develops over time, it can become necessary to adjust dividends, as we did at the end of 2015 , in order to maintain our original expected level of long term product profitability.
24090_17_ITEM7_P53_S3	Policyholders' dividends decreased 36.4% in 2016 compared to 2015 , due to the dividend rate actions that we took at the end of 2015 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	Commission expense fluctuates in a direct relationship to new and renewal insurance premiums and has increased 2.3% in 2016 compared to 2015 as first year premium revenues, on which higher commission rates are paid, remained relatively flat while renewal premiums were up 2.7% .
24090_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	Total general expenses increased 0.2% on a consolidated basis in 2016 due primarily to increased legal, consulting and audit fees related to our tax compliance issue and business strategies review, as well as higher salaries, bonuses and related employee benefits paid to top executives.
24090_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	Total general expenses decreased 9.0% on a consolidated basis in 2015 due primarily to the tax compliance issue we recognized in 2014 resulting in $10.2 million additional expense in 2014 for our best estimate liability.
24090_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	In 2015, we recorded an additional $3.4 million of expense related to this tax compliance issue.
24090_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	We perform an expense study on an annual basis, utilizing an enterprise-wide time study, and we adjust cost allocations among entities as needed based upon this review.
24090_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	Any allocation changes are reflected in the segment operations, but do not impact total expenses.
24090_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	Capitalized deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") were $32.7 million , $31.1 million and $32.1 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	These costs will vary based upon successful efforts related to newly issued policies and renewal business.
24090_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	Significantly lower amounts are capitalized related to renewal business in correlation with the lower commissions paid on that business compared to first year business which have higher commission rates.
24090_17_ITEM7_P58_S3	In addition, the prolonged low interest rate environment impacted the assumptions used in the development of the DAC asset for new policies issued.
24090_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	Amortization of DAC totaled $28.5 million , $23.4 million and $21.1 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 primarily due to the higher surrender activity, including early duration elections to convert to reduced paid up ("RPU") or extended term insurance ("ETI") in 2016.
24090_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	There are higher deferred acquisition costs associated with early duration conversions to RPU or ETI, which, when converted, increases amortization expense.
24090_17_ITEM7_P59_S2	Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is impacted by persistency and the higher level of surrenders is impacting our amortization.
24090_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	Federal income tax expense (benefit) was $3.5 million , $1.2 million and $4.0 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of 64.1% , (61.8)% and (206.2)% , respectively.
24090_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	The significant changes in rates noted are the result of the tax compliance issue we identified in 2014 which impacted our effective tax rates in each year as these costs are not deductible for tax.
24090_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	Additionally, the Company recorded a tax expense in each year for an uncertain tax position that is affecting the tax rates.
24090_17_ITEM7_P60_S3	Differences between our effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate result from income and expense items that are treated differently for financial reporting and tax purposes.
24090_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	Our business is comprised of three operating business segments, as detailed below.
24090_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	Our insurance operations are the primary focus of the Company, as those segments generate the majority of our income.
24090_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	The amount of insurance, number of policies, and average face amounts of policies issued during the periods indicated are shown below.
24090_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	These segments are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
24090_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	The Company evaluates profit and loss performance based on net income before federal income taxes.
24090_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	Our Life Insurance segment primarily issues ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies in U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents in approximately 30 countries through approximately 1,525 independent marketing consultants, and domestically through over 60 independent marketing firms and consultants throughout the United States.
24090_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	Premium revenues increased for 2016 compared to 2015 and 2014 , due to higher international renewal premiums, which have experienced strong persistency as this block of insurance ages.
24090_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	First year premiums decreased slightly in the current year, which we believe is due to cutting dividend rates to make our products more profitable, but which appeared to have less of an impact that we anticipated.
24090_17_ITEM7_P66_S2	Sales from Colombia, Taiwan and Brazil represented the majority of the premium increase.
24090_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	Life Insurance premium breakout is detailed below.
24090_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	Endowment sales represent a significant portion of new business sales internationally, as these products continue to exceed our whole life sales in the current markets.
24090_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	In addition, most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision, which allows the policyholder to use cash value of a policy to pay premiums.
24090_17_ITEM7_P68_S2	The policy loan asset balance increased 10.8% year over year.
24090_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	The following table sets forth, by country, our direct premiums from our international life insurance business for the periods indicated.
24090_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	Our international business and premium collections could be impacted by future changes relative to laws, regulations or economic events in the countries from which we accept applications.
24090_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	We continue to report strong first year and renewal premiums in our top producing countries as noted above, however this business is dependent on our clients having access to U.S. dollars.
24090_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	Our international business and premium collections could be impacted by our inability to comply with current or future foreign laws or regulations applicable to the Company or our independent consultants in the countries from which we accept applications as well as by marketing or operational changes made by the Company to comply with those laws or regulations.
24090_17_ITEM7_P70_S2	Our international business may also be affected by economic or other events in foreign countries in which our policies are marketed.
24090_17_ITEM7_P70_S3	Venezuela, for example, is continuing to experience civil unrest due to local demonstrations against crime, corruption and soaring inflation.
24090_17_ITEM7_P70_S4	See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" on pages 10 and 17 for additional information.
24090_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	The following table sets forth our direct premiums by state from our domestic business for the periods indicated.
24090_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	We believe that our domestic business has been declining because our domestic business, unlike our international business, does not have a dedicated marketing team.
24090_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	Moreover, a number of domestic life insurance companies we acquired had blocks of accident and health insurance policies which we did not consider to be a core part of our business and which we have ceded, in large part, to an unaffiliated insurance company under a coinsurance agreement.
24090_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	Net investment income has increased due to continued growth in average invested assets even though the annual yield has decreased 13 basis points in this segment from 2015 , as discussed in the Consolidated Results of Operations above.
24090_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	In 2016 and 2015 , the Company recognized losses on other-than-temporary impairments totaling $2.3 million and $3.8 million, respectively, related to bond and mutual fund holdings.
24090_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	Realized losses of $0.2 million in 2014 were recognized due to the write-down and sale of mutual fund holdings.
24090_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	A breakout of claims and surrender benefits is detailed below.
24090_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	Death claims expense decreased 14.0% in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased 25.3% in 2015 compared to 2014 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	No unusual trends have been noted in our claims experience, except we did experience several higher value claims in the first quarter of 2015 , which drove the 2015 increase.
24090_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	Mortality experience is closely monitored by the Company as a key performance indicator and these amounts were within expected levels.
24090_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	We noted increases in surrender expense over the last several years which is primarily related to our international business and is expected to increase over time due to the aging of this block of business.
24090_17_ITEM7_P78_S1	The majority of policy surrender benefits paid is attributable to our international business and historically was related to policies that have been in force over fifteen years, when surrender charges are no longer applicable.
24090_17_ITEM7_P78_S2	However, in 2016 the increased surrender activity is also in the earlier durations (years 1-15), which still have surrender charges.
24090_17_ITEM7_P78_S3	We are seeing various reasons for individuals surrendering their policies, including the sustained slow world-wide economy, individuals simply needing their money and former independent consultants moving business to other insurance carriers.
24090_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	Endowment benefit expense results from the election by policyholders of a product feature that provides an annual benefit.
24090_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	This is a fixed benefit over the life of the contract, and this expense will increase with new sales and improved persistency.
24090_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	Matured endowments increased in each of the last two years and we expect this trend to continue as this block of business increases, persists and policies begin to reach maturity.
24090_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	Other policy benefits resulted primarily from interest paid on premium deposits and policy benefit accumulations and increased as these policy liabilities also increased.
24090_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	Increase in Future Policy Benefit Reserves .
24090_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	Policy benefit reserves in 2016 decreased compared to the same period in 2015 , primarily as a result of the higher surrenders and slightly lower new sales as noted above.
24090_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	Endowment sales totaled approximately $16.5 million , $16.4 million and $16.1 million , representing approximately 77.0% , 76.1% and 72.7% of total new first year premiums in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
24090_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	Policyholders' dividends decreased 36.7% in 2016 compared to 2015 , due to the dividend rate actions taken by us at the end of 2015 to improve our product profitability.
24090_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	The Company issues long duration participating policies to foreign residents that are expected to pay dividends to policyholders based upon actual experience.
24090_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	The life company boards approve any dividends on an annual basis and may change the dividend rates as needed for business purposes.
24090_17_ITEM7_P85_S2	Policyholder dividends are factored into the premiums at the time the product is developed and therefore have no impact on expected profitability.
24090_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	Capitalization and Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs .
24090_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	Capitalized costs increased, as commission-related costs have increased in the current year compared to 2015 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P86_S2	Amortization of DAC increased in the current year by 22.0% from 2015 as we experienced increased surrender activity in the current year, including early duration elections to convert to reduced paid up ("RPU") or extended term insurance ("ETI") in 2016.
24090_17_ITEM7_P86_S3	There are higher deferred acquisition costs associated with early duration conversions to RPU or ETI, which, when converted, increases amortization expense.
24090_17_ITEM7_P86_S4	Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is impacted by persistency and the higher level of surrenders is impacting our amortization.
24090_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	Commission expense increase or decrease is directly related to the increase or decrease in premiums.
24090_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	First year policy premiums pay a higher commission rate than renewal policy premiums.
24090_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	The expenses are allocated by segment, based upon an annual expense study performed by the Company.
24090_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	Other general expenses decreased 12% to $14.3 million in 2016 compared to $16.3 million in 2015 , driven in part by reduced expenses related to the IRC tax compliance issue for life and annuity insurance remediation expense, which totaled $1.9 million in 2016, compared with $4.4 million in 2015, somewhat offset by higher expenses related to actuarial, tax, audit and legal services related to tax compliance and business analysis initiatives.
24090_17_ITEM7_P89_S2	In 2014 , amounts are higher by $7.9 million as compared to 2013 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P89_S3	This increase is due to the estimated remediation costs of $8.3 million associated with the tax compliance issue we identified.
24090_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	Our Home Service Insurance segment provides pre-need and final expense ordinary life insurance and annuities to middle and lower income individuals primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	Our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through funeral homes and a home service marketing distribution system utilizing over 730 employees and independent agents.
24090_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	In March of 2014, we completed the acquisition of MGLIC which is a wholly owned subsidiary of SPLIC.
24090_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	MGLIC is licensed in Mississippi and customarily sells policies through independent funeral homes.
24090_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	As part of the conversion process and transitioning policy administration to our computer system, we identified some operational challenges that we are working to improve related to our business processes.
24090_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	The risk profile of this business is higher than the debit based agent collections since the funeral home is the agent and beneficiary to the claims in many cases.
24090_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	We have incorporated policyholder direct mail and contact within the MGLIC operations to help mitigate risks.
24090_17_ITEM7_P93_S2	Our Mississippi clients have experienced enhanced support from the affiliated companies and operational benefits.
24090_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	The premiums in this segment increased slightly in 2016 compared to 2015 , as renewal premiums increased while first year premiums decreased slightly as the Home Service business is a mature business.
24090_17_ITEM7_P94_S1	This is the same trend we saw in 2015 compared to 2014 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	The following table sets forth our direct premiums by state for the periods indicated.
24090_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	Direct premiums have remained relatively flat due to the maturity of this business.
24090_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	Net investment income decreased in 2016 as our average invested assets decreased as did the overall portfolio yield by 2 basis points from 2015 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P97_S1	MGLIC investment income included 10 months, for the period of ownership during 2014.
24090_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	Net investment income for our home service insurance segment is summarized as follows:
24090_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	Realized Investment Gains (Losses), Net .
24090_17_ITEM7_P99_S1	In 2016 and 2015 , the Company recognized losses on other-than-temporary impairments totaling $2.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively, related to bond and mutual fund holdings.
24090_17_ITEM7_P99_S2	In 2014, we recorded net gains of $0.1 million resulting from gains from calls and sales related to bonds of $0.2 million less an OTTI adjustment on mutual funds of $0.1 million.
24090_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	A breakout of claims and surrender benefits is detailed below.
24090_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	Death claims expense decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 , after increasing in 2015 from 2014 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P101_S1	Death claims can fluctuate from year to year.
24090_17_ITEM7_P101_S2	Mortality experience is closely monitored by the Company as a key performance indicator and these amounts were within expected levels.
24090_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	Surrender expenses are consistent with expectations for the current economic conditions.
24090_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	Property claims increased in both 2016 and 2015 related to reported weather claims.
24090_17_ITEM7_P103_S1	The large increase in 2016 was primarily due to tornado activity in Louisiana earlier in the year and high winds that accompanied the severe flooding in Louisiana.
24090_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	Increase in Future Policy Benefit Reserves .
24090_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	The change in reserves includes estimated reserve changes related to the IRC 7702 tax compliance issue of a decrease of $0.5 million and $0.5 million in 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
24090_17_ITEM7_P104_S2	These reserves decreased in both periods due to a more refined estimate.
24090_17_ITEM7_P104_S3	Reserves increased $1.4 million in 2014 related to the tax compliance issue.
24090_17_ITEM7_P104_S4	Absent the change in reserves related to the IRC tax issue, the change in reserves between the periods was minimal, as premiums were relatively flat and lapse experience was comparable for all three periods presented.
24090_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	Commission expense was comparable for all three periods presented based upon premiums collected.
24090_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	These expenses are allocated by segment based upon an annual expense study performed by the Company.
24090_17_ITEM7_P106_S1	The 2016 expenses related to the IRC tax compliance issue for life and annuity insurance remediation expense remained flat compared to the 2015 expense, while in 2015 the expense decreased $1.7 million due to further refinement of our estimates.
24090_17_ITEM7_P106_S2	Both 2016 and 2015 include higher expenses related to actuarial, tax, audit and legal services related to tax compliance and business analysis initiatives, although those costs are even greater in 2016 than in 2015 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	Capitalization and Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs ("DAC") .
24090_17_ITEM7_P107_S1	DAC capitalization is directly correlated to fluctuations in first year commissions.
24090_17_ITEM7_P107_S2	Amortization of DAC was relatively level, between 2015 and 2014 , but increased by 21.1% in 2016 from 2015 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P107_S3	This increase was primarily due to an increase in surrenders and the impact of updated annual GAAP assumptions.
24090_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	We monitor lapse rates as a key component of our insurance operations.
24090_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	This segment represents the administrative support entities to the insurance operations whose revenues are primarily intercompany and have been eliminated in consolidation under GAAP, which typically results in a segment loss.
24090_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	Financial stability and the prevention of capital erosion are important investment considerations for the Company.
24090_17_ITEM7_P111_S0	A primary investment goal is the conservation of assets due to the long-term nature of a significant portion of our liabilities.
24090_17_ITEM7_P112_S0	of our investment portfolios is handled internally, pursuant to board-approved investment guidelines, with all trading activity approved by a committee of each entity s respective board of directors.
24090_17_ITEM7_P112_S1	The guidelines used require that securities are of high quality and investment grade.
24090_17_ITEM7_P113_S0	State insurance statutes prescribe the quality and percentage of the various types of investments that may be made by insurance companies and generally permit investment in qualified state, municipal, federal and foreign government obligations, high quality corporate bonds, preferred and common stock, mortgage loans and real estate within certain specified percentages.
24090_17_ITEM7_P113_S1	The assets selected are generally intended to mature in accordance with the average maturity of the insurance products and to provide the cash flow for our insurance company subsidiaries to meet their respective policyholder obligations.
24090_17_ITEM7_P113_S2	Due to the prolonged low interest rate environment, we have intentionally shortened the duration of our asset portfolio to capitalize on new investment purchases as interest rates rise.
24090_17_ITEM7_P113_S3	As rates rise, we plan to extend assets durations and increase investment yields.
24090_17_ITEM7_P114_S0	The following table shows the carrying value of our investments by investment category and cash and cash equivalents, and the percentage of each to total invested assets.
24090_17_ITEM7_P115_S0	(1) Includes $2.2 million and $2.6 million of U.S. Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprise for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
24090_17_ITEM7_P115_S1	(2) Includes $273.4 million and $273.1 million of securities guaranteed by third parties for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
24090_17_ITEM7_P116_S0	The current year decline in U.S. government-sponsored securities is due to call activity from this sector and reinvestment into fixed maturity corporate and municipal bond categories.
24090_17_ITEM7_P116_S1	The Company has increased investments in municipals primarily related to Build America taxable bonds, essential services and corporate issuer holdings in various industry sectors.
24090_17_ITEM7_P117_S0	At December 31, 2016 , investments in fixed maturity and equity securities were 91.2% of our total cash, cash equivalents and investments.
24090_17_ITEM7_P117_S1	All of our fixed maturities were classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P117_S2	We had no fixed maturity or equity securities that were classified as trading securities at December 31, 2016 or 2015 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P118_S0	As previously discussed, our investment portfolios have been impacted significantly by the low interest rate environment over the past several years.
24090_17_ITEM7_P118_S1	The following table shows investment yields by segment operations as of December 31 for each year presented.
24090_17_ITEM7_P119_S0	Yields on investment assets vary between segment operations due to different portfolio mixes and durations in the segments.
24090_17_ITEM7_P119_S1	The life segment previously invested more in U.S. Government securities, however over the past few years it has invested in municipal and corporate issuers and is now more similar to the home service segment which has had concentrations primarily in the municipal and corporate sectors.
24090_17_ITEM7_P120_S0	Credit ratings reported for the periods indicated are assigned by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ("NRSRO") such as Moody s Investors Service, Standard Poor s and Fitch Ratings.
24090_17_ITEM7_P120_S1	A credit rating assigned by a NRSRO is a quality based rating, with AAA representing the highest quality and D the lowest, with BBB and above being considered investment grade.
24090_17_ITEM7_P120_S2	In addition, the Company may use credit ratings of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") Securities Valuation Office ("SVO") as assigned, if there is no NRSRO rating.
24090_17_ITEM7_P120_S3	Securities rated by the SVO are grouped in the equivalent NRSRO category as stated by the SVO and securities that are not rated by a NRSRO are included in the "other" category.
24090_17_ITEM7_P121_S0	The following table shows the distribution of the credit ratings of our portfolio of fixed maturity securities by carrying value.
24090_17_ITEM7_P122_S0	The Company made new investments in higher-grade municipals and corporate bonds.
24090_17_ITEM7_P123_S0	Non-investment grade securities are the result of downgrades of issuers or securities acquired during acquisitions of companies, as the Company does not purchase below investment grade securities.
24090_17_ITEM7_P124_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company held municipal securities that include third party guarantees.
24090_17_ITEM7_P124_S1	Detailed below is a presentation by NRSRO rating of our municipal holdings by funding type.
24090_17_ITEM7_P125_S0	The Company held investments in special revenue bonds that were greater than 10% of fair value based upon activity as of December 31, 2016 , as shown in the table below.
24090_17_ITEM7_P126_S0	The tables below represent the Company s detailed exposure of municipal holdings in Louisiana, Texas and Florida, which comprise the most significant state concentrations of the total municipal portfolio as of December 31, 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P127_S0	The Company invests in municipal securities of issuers in the state of Louisiana and receives a credit that reduces its premium tax liability in that state.
24090_17_ITEM7_P127_S1	At December 31, 2016 , total holdings of municipal securities in Louisiana represented 4.9% of all municipal holdings based upon fair value.
24090_17_ITEM7_P128_S0	The Company also holds 23.8% of its municipal holdings in Texas issuers.
24090_17_ITEM7_P129_S0	The Company also holds 11.4% of its municipal holdings in Florida issuers.
24090_17_ITEM7_P130_S0	There were no other states or individual issuer holdings that represented or exceeded 10% of the total municipal portfolio as of December 31, 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P131_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of our fixed maturity and equity securities at least quarterly.
24090_17_ITEM7_P132_S0	The Company monitors all debt and equity securities on an on-going basis relative to changes in credit ratings, market prices, earnings trends and financial performance, in addition to specific region or industry reviews.
24090_17_ITEM7_P133_S0	The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on a case-by-case evaluation of underlying reasons for the decline in fair value.
24090_17_ITEM7_P134_S0	The Company determines other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) by reviewing all relevant evidence related to the specific security issuer as well as the Company's intent to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost.
24090_17_ITEM7_P135_S0	When an OTTI has occurred, the amount of the OTTI recognized in earnings depends on whether the Company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis.
24090_17_ITEM7_P135_S1	If the Company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, an OTTI is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_17_ITEM7_P135_S2	If the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Company is required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the OTTI will be separated into the following: a) the amount representing the credit loss; and b) the amount related to all other factors.
24090_17_ITEM7_P135_S3	The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings.
24090_17_ITEM7_P135_S4	The amount of the total OTTI related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_17_ITEM7_P135_S5	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_17_ITEM7_P135_S6	The new amortized cost is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value.
24090_17_ITEM7_P136_S0	In 2016 and 2015 , the Company recognized losses on other-than-temporary impairments totaling $4.3 million and $5.4 million , respectively, related to bond and mutual fund holdings.
24090_17_ITEM7_P136_S1	In 2014, impairments of $0.4 million were recorded as a result of our OTTI analysis.
24090_17_ITEM7_P136_S2	Based upon our analysis of whether declines in fair value below cost are temporary or other-than-temporary, management believes that our investments in fixed maturity investments at December 31, 2016 were not impaired, and no additional other-than-temporary losses need to be recorded.
24090_17_ITEM7_P137_S0	Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities available-for-sale amounted to $9.2 million as of December 31, 2016 and $7.9 million as of December 31, 2015 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P137_S1	This increase in gross unrealized losses was due to an increase in the interest rate environment in the fourth quarter of 2016 , following a fairly significant drop in rates during the first three quarters of 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P137_S2	There were $0.1 million and $0.6 million of gross unrealized losses on equity securities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P138_S0	As is customary among insurance companies, our insurance company subsidiaries reinsure with other companies portions of the life insurance risks they underwrite.
24090_17_ITEM7_P138_S1	A primary purpose of reinsurance agreements is to enable an insurance company to reduce the amount of risk on any particular life and, by reinsuring the amount exceeding the maximum amount the insurance company is willing to retain, to insure individuals in amounts larger than it could without such agreements.
24090_17_ITEM7_P138_S2	Even though a portion of the risk may be reinsured, our insurance company subsidiaries remain liable to perform all the obligations imposed by the policies issued by them and could be liable if their reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements.
24090_17_ITEM7_P139_S0	We believe we have established appropriate reinsurance coverage based upon our net retained insured liabilities compared to our surplus.
24090_17_ITEM7_P140_S0	The effect of reinsurance on premiums is as follows.
24090_17_ITEM7_P141_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries monitor the solvency of their reinsurers in seeking to minimize the risk of loss in the event of default by a reinsurer.
24090_17_ITEM7_P142_S0	The primary reinsurers of our insurance subsidiaries are large, well-capitalized entities.
24090_17_ITEM7_P143_S0	The effect of reinsurance on life insurance in force is as follows.
24090_17_ITEM7_P144_S0	Virtually all of the Company's non-credit accident and health insurance has been reinsured and is administered by Unified Life Insurance Company, an unaffiliated party.
24090_17_ITEM7_P144_S1	The reinsurance recoverables under this agreement are collateralized by assets held in a trust for the benefit of the reinsured policies.
24090_17_ITEM7_P145_S0	The Company monitors the credit ratings of our life and property reinsurers.
24090_17_ITEM7_P145_S1	The ratings by A.M. Best Company range from B+ (Good) to A+ (Superior).
24090_17_ITEM7_P146_S0	SPFIC has first and second event catastrophe reinsurance coverage of $10.0 million per event and a retention level of $500,000 per event.
24090_17_ITEM7_P146_S1	Thus, the first $500,000 of incurred claims and any claims in excess of $10.0 million are SPFIC's responsibility.
24090_17_ITEM7_P147_S0	The reinsurance premium for first event catastrophe reinsurance was $828,000 , $873,000 and $967,000 in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
24090_17_ITEM7_P148_S0	Liquidity refers to a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the needs of its operations.
24090_17_ITEM7_P148_S1	Liquidity is managed on insurance operations to ensure stable and reliable sources of cash flows to meet obligations and is provided by a variety of sources.
24090_17_ITEM7_P149_S0	Our liquidity requirements are met primarily by funds provided from operations.
24090_17_ITEM7_P149_S1	Premium deposits and revenues, investment income and investment maturities are the primary sources of funds, while investment purchases, policy benefits, and operating expenses are the primary uses of funds.
24090_17_ITEM7_P149_S2	We historically have not had to liquidate investments to provide cash flow, and there were no liquidity issues in 2016 or 2015 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P149_S3	Our investments consist of 72.1% of marketable debt securities and 1.5% of equity securities classified as available-for-sale that could be readily converted to cash for liquidity needs.
24090_17_ITEM7_P150_S0	A primary liquidity concern is the risk of an extraordinary level of early policyholder withdrawals.
24090_17_ITEM7_P150_S1	We include provisions within our insurance policies, such as surrender charges, that help limit and discourage early withdrawals.
24090_17_ITEM7_P150_S2	Since these contractual withdrawals, as well as the level of surrenders experienced, have been largely consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management, our associated cash outflows have, historically, not had an adverse impact on our overall liquidity.
24090_17_ITEM7_P151_S0	Individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy.
24090_17_ITEM7_P151_S1	Cash flow projections and cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios are also performed annually to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy.
24090_17_ITEM7_P152_S0	We currently anticipate that available liquidity sources and future cash flows will be adequate to meet our needs for funds.
24090_17_ITEM7_P153_S0	Cash flows from our insurance operations historically have been sufficient to meet current needs.
24090_17_ITEM7_P153_S1	Cash flows from operating activities were $102.3 million , $87.2 million and $97.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
24090_17_ITEM7_P153_S2	We have traditionally also had significant cash flows from both scheduled and unscheduled fixed maturity security calls, maturities, redemptions, and prepayments, which totaled $70.4 million , $95.6 million and $71.4 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P153_S3	These cash flows, for the most part, are reinvested in fixed income securities.
24090_17_ITEM7_P153_S4	Net cash outflows from investment activity totaled $152.1 million , $58.0 million and $104.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
24090_17_ITEM7_P153_S5	The outflows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 , primarily related to the investment of excess cash and cash equivalents generated from operations during 2016 , in addition to the investment of excess cash held at the end of 2015.
24090_17_ITEM7_P153_S6	The Company's cash flows from financing activities were $2.5 million in 2016 , $3.0 million in 2015 and $2.1 million in 2014 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P154_S0	See "Parent Company Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for a discussion of additional Parent Company liquidity.
24090_17_ITEM7_P155_S0	In 2015, we determined that a portion of the life insurance and annuity policies issued by our subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702 and 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") of 1986.
24090_17_ITEM7_P155_S1	As a result, we have established a liability reserve of $ 14.4 million, net of tax for probable liabilities and expenses associated with this tax compliance matter, which represents management s best estimate and we have disclosed an estimated range related to probable liabilities and expenses of $7.5 million to $44.8 million , net of tax.
24090_17_ITEM7_P155_S2	This estimate and range includes projected toll charges and fees payable to the IRS, as well as estimated increased payout obligations to current and former holders of non-compliant domestic life insurance policies expected to result from remediation of those policies.
24090_17_ITEM7_P155_S3	The amount of our liabilities and expenses depends on a number of uncertainties, including the number of prior tax years for which we may be liable to the IRS, the number of domestic life insurance policies we will be required to remediate, and the methodology applicable to the calculation of taxable benefits under non-compliant policies.
24090_17_ITEM7_P155_S4	Given the range of potential outcomes and the significant variables assumed in establishing our estimates, actual amounts incurred may exceed our reserve and also could exceed the high end of our estimated range of liabilities and expenses.
24090_17_ITEM7_P156_S0	This tax compliance issue impacts our policyholders and their tax liabilities relative to these products that fail 7702 and 72(s) for those that will not be remediated.
24090_17_ITEM7_P157_S0	The exposure related to future sales or products in force is unknown at this time.
24090_17_ITEM7_P157_S1	Policyholders could decide to surrender their policies due to this issue which would subsequently result in higher cash outflows due to an increase in surrender activity.
24090_17_ITEM7_P158_S0	The NAIC has established minimum capital requirements in the form of RBC.
24090_17_ITEM7_P158_S1	RBC considers the type of business written by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company's business to develop a minimum level of capital called "Authorized Control Level Risk-based Capital" and compares this level to an adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves.
24090_17_ITEM7_P158_S2	Should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk-based capital fall below 200%, a series of remedial actions by the affected company would be required.
24090_17_ITEM7_P159_S0	At December 31, 2016 , all of our insurance subsidiaries were above the required minimum RBC levels.
24090_17_ITEM7_P160_S0	On November 1, 2016, SPLIC paid a $20.0 million extraordinary dividend to its parent, CICA.
24090_17_ITEM7_P160_S1	The dividend had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and will be used by CICA for general corporate purposes.
24090_17_ITEM7_P160_S2	The dividend was approved by the Louisiana Department of Insurance, SPLIC s state of domicile.
24090_17_ITEM7_P160_S3	SPLIC s risk-based capital after the dividend remains is in excess of minimum capital requirements.
24090_17_ITEM7_P161_S0	In the second quarter of 2016, Citizens, Inc. purchased Class A Common shares from CTI with an approximate fair value of $0.8 million.
24090_17_ITEM7_P162_S0	We have committed to the following contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 , with the payments due by the period indicated below:
24090_17_ITEM7_P163_S0	The payments related to the future policy benefits and policy claims payable reflected in the table above have been projected utilizing assumptions based upon our historical experience and anticipated future experience.
24090_17_ITEM7_P164_S0	The Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2016 and, therefore, does not expect any future effects on the Company's financial condition related to any such arrangements.
24090_17_ITEM7_P165_S0	We do not utilize special purpose entities as investment vehicles, nor are there any such entities in which we have an investment that engages in speculative activities of any nature, and we do not use such investments to hedge our investment positions.
24090_17_ITEM7_P166_S0	Citizens is a holding company and has had minimal operations of its own.
24090_17_ITEM7_P166_S1	Our assets consist of the capital stock of our subsidiaries, cash, fixed income securities, mutual funds and investment real estate.
24090_17_ITEM7_P166_S2	Our cash flows depend primarily upon the availability of statutorily permissible payments, primarily payments under management agreements from our two primary life insurance subsidiaries, CICA and SPLIC.
24090_17_ITEM7_P166_S3	The ability to make payments is limited by applicable laws and regulations of Colorado, CICA's state of domicile, and Louisiana, SPLIC's state of domicile, which subject insurance operations to significant regulatory restrictions.
24090_17_ITEM7_P166_S4	These laws and regulations require, among other things, that these insurance subsidiaries maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company.
24090_17_ITEM7_P167_S0	We historically have not relied upon dividends from subsidiaries for our cash flow needs.
24090_17_ITEM7_P167_S1	However, CICA and SPLIC both dividend available funds from time to time in relation to new acquisition target strategies.
24090_17_ITEM7_P168_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , Citizens had fixed maturities available for sale of $51.4 million and cash of $14.7 million , which represents additional liquidity for future acquisitions, liquidity support for the life insurance companies and for general corporate purposes.
24090_17_ITEM7_P169_S0	Additionally, a substantial portion of our international policyholders invest their policy cash dividends and benefits in our Class A common stock through our Stock Investment Plan (the Plan ).
24090_17_ITEM7_P169_S1	Once a policyholder elects to participate in the Plan, their policy benefits can be used to purchase Citizens Class A common stock through the Plan in the open market.
24090_17_ITEM7_P169_S2	In addition, our existing holders of Class A common stock, our employees and our independent consultants are eligible to participate in the Plan.
24090_17_ITEM7_P169_S3	If fewer policyholders elect to participate in the Plan, or if our international premium collections were to decrease as a result of regulatory or marketing impediments, the trading volume of our Class A common stock may decline from its present levels.
24090_17_ITEM7_P170_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
24090_17_ITEM7_P170_S1	Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM7_P170_S2	While we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available.
24090_17_ITEM7_P170_S3	Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
24090_17_ITEM7_P171_S0	Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.
24090_17_ITEM7_P172_S0	No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting policies.
24090_17_ITEM7_P173_S0	Our critical accounting policies are as follows:
24090_17_ITEM7_P174_S0	Future policy benefit reserves have been computed by the net level premium method with assumptions as to investment yields, dividends on participating business, mortality and withdrawals based upon our experience.
24090_17_ITEM7_P174_S1	The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of policy liabilities and the increase in future policy benefit reserves.
24090_17_ITEM7_P174_S2	Management's judgments and estimates for future policy benefit reserves provide for possible unfavorable deviation.
24090_17_ITEM7_P175_S0	We continue to use the original assumptions (including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation) in subsequent periods to determine the changes in the liability for future policy benefits (the "lock-in concept ) unless a premium deficiency exists.
24090_17_ITEM7_P175_S1	Management monitors these assumptions and has determined that a premium deficiency did not exist as of December 31, 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P175_S2	Management believes that our policy liabilities and increase in future policy benefit reserves as of the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 are based upon assumptions, including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation, that do not warrant revision.
24090_17_ITEM7_P176_S0	Acquisition costs, consisting of commissions and policy issuance, underwriting and agency expenses that relate to and vary with the successful production of new business, are deferred.
24090_17_ITEM7_P176_S1	These deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized primarily over the premium-paying period of the policies, using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_17_ITEM7_P177_S0	We utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance.
24090_17_ITEM7_P177_S1	The factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period.
24090_17_ITEM7_P177_S2	The factor method ensures that policies which lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation.
24090_17_ITEM7_P177_S3	The factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value, provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors.
24090_17_ITEM7_P178_S0	Inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred, the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_17_ITEM7_P178_S1	Approximately 94.0% of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year excess commissions.
24090_17_ITEM7_P178_S2	The remaining 6.0% are attributed to costs that vary with and are directly related to the successful acquisition of new insurance business.
24090_17_ITEM7_P178_S3	Those costs generally include costs related to the production, underwriting and issuance of new business.
24090_17_ITEM7_P179_S0	DAC is subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issuance and loss recognition testing on an annual basis, or when an event occurs that might require loss recognition testing.
24090_17_ITEM7_P179_S1	If loss recognition or impairment is necessary, DAC would be written off to the extent that anticipated future premiums and investment income is insufficient to cover expect future policy benefits and expenses.
24090_17_ITEM7_P180_S0	Loss recognition testing that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience calculates the available premium (gross premium less the benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 50 years.
24090_17_ITEM7_P180_S1	The available premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated.
24090_17_ITEM7_P180_S2	The deferred policy acquisition costs are then evaluated for recoverability using best estimate assumptions.
24090_17_ITEM7_P180_S3	Management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value.
24090_17_ITEM7_P180_S4	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on capitalized expenses that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business, utilization of the factor method and recoverability testing at the time of policy issuance and the annual loss recognition testing.
24090_17_ITEM7_P181_S0	Cost of Customer Relationships Acquired ("CCRA") is established when we purchase a block of insurance.
24090_17_ITEM7_P181_S1	CCRA is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_17_ITEM7_P182_S0	We utilize various methods to determine the amount of the ending asset balance, including a static model and a dynamic model.
24090_17_ITEM7_P182_S1	Inherent in the amortization of CCRA are certain management judgments about the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_17_ITEM7_P182_S2	The assumptions used are based upon interest, mortality and lapses at the time of purchase.
24090_17_ITEM7_P183_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_17_ITEM7_P183_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 50 years.
24090_17_ITEM7_P183_S2	The CCRA is then evaluated for recoverability utilizing best estimate assumptions.
24090_17_ITEM7_P183_S3	Management believes our CCRA and related amortization is recoverable for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
24090_17_ITEM7_P183_S4	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on estimated future results of the block and our annual recoverability testing.
24090_17_ITEM7_P184_S0	Current accounting guidance requires that goodwill balances be reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event has occurred.
24090_17_ITEM7_P185_S0	A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment on one level below an operating segment.
24090_17_ITEM7_P185_S1	Most of the Company's reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated, are equivalent to the Company's operating segment, as there is no discrete financial information reviewed and analyzed by management for the separate components of the segment or all of the components of the segment have similar economic characteristics.
24090_17_ITEM7_P186_S0	The goodwill impairment test follows a multi-step process as defined under current accounting guidance.
24090_17_ITEM7_P186_S1	An initial review may be performed whereby the assessment is based upon qualitative factors before performing the first test step.
24090_17_ITEM7_P187_S0	fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
24090_17_ITEM7_P187_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment.
24090_17_ITEM7_P187_S2	In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value.
24090_17_ITEM7_P187_S3	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
24090_17_ITEM7_P188_S0	Management s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations based on assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit.
24090_17_ITEM7_P188_S1	Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections.
24090_17_ITEM7_P189_S0	The evaluation of securities for impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings.
24090_17_ITEM7_P189_S1	The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition or future prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period.
24090_17_ITEM7_P190_S0	Based upon current accounting guidance, investment securities must be classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading.
24090_17_ITEM7_P190_S1	Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase.
24090_17_ITEM7_P191_S0	The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities.
24090_17_ITEM7_P191_S1	Fixed maturity securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the Company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity.
24090_17_ITEM7_P191_S2	Securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings until realized.
24090_17_ITEM7_P192_S0	The Company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if an OTTI exists pursuant to the accounting guidelines.
24090_17_ITEM7_P192_S1	In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the ability and intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
24090_17_ITEM7_P192_S2	In analyzing an issuer's financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the Federal government or its agencies, by government-sponsored agencies, or whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and reviews of the issuer's financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM7_P193_S0	If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, management must then determine the amount of OTTI to be recognized in earnings.
24090_17_ITEM7_P193_S1	If management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.
24090_17_ITEM7_P193_S2	The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.
24090_17_ITEM7_P193_S3	The amount of OTTI related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_17_ITEM7_P193_S4	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_17_ITEM7_P193_S5	If management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_17_ITEM7_P193_S6	Any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain (as other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold.
24090_17_ITEM7_P194_S0	The Company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions, future market movements, business plan changes, or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time.
24090_17_ITEM7_P195_S0	Premiums on life and accident and health policies are reported as earned when due or, for short duration contracts, over the contract period on a pro rata basis.
24090_17_ITEM7_P195_S1	Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in recognition of profits over the estimated life of the contracts.
24090_17_ITEM7_P195_S2	This matching is accomplished by means of provisions for future benefits and the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_17_ITEM7_P196_S0	Annuities are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest bearing financial instruments.
24090_17_ITEM7_P197_S0	Our primary annuity products do not include fees or other such charges.
24090_17_ITEM7_P198_S0	A deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recorded only if a determination is made that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax treatment on which the deferred tax item depends will be sustained in the event of an audit.
24090_17_ITEM7_P198_S1	These determinations inherently involve management's judgment.
24090_17_ITEM7_P198_S2	In addition, the Company must record a tax valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
24090_17_ITEM7_P198_S3	This valuation allowance is in essence a contra account to the deferred tax asset.
24090_17_ITEM7_P198_S4	Management must determine the portion of the deferred tax asset and resulting tax benefit that may not be realized based upon judgment of expected outcomes.
24090_17_ITEM7_P199_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_17_ITEM7_P199_S1	Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position.
24090_17_ITEM7_P200_S0	An estimated loss from a contingency is accrued and charged to results of operations only if both of the following conditions are met:
24090_17_ITEM7_P201_S0	Information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable (virtual certainty is not required) that an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred as of the date of the financial statements; and 2.
24090_17_ITEM7_P201_S1	The amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
24090_17_ITEM7_P202_S0	Reasonable estimation of a possible loss does not require estimating a single amount of the loss.
24090_17_ITEM7_P202_S1	It requires that a loss be accrued if it can be estimated within a range.
24090_17_ITEM7_P202_S2	If an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, that amount is accrued.
24090_17_ITEM7_P202_S3	If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
24090_17_ITEM7_P203_S0	A gain contingency is an uncertain situation that will be resolved in the future, possibly resulting in a gain.
24090_17_ITEM7_P203_S1	We do not allow the recognition of a gain contingency prior to settlement of the underlying event.
24090_17_ITEM7_P203_S2	If we were to have a gain contingency, we would disclose it in the notes to the financial statements.
24090_17_ITEM7_P204_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The nature of our business exposes us to market risk relative to our invested assets and policy liabilities.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Market risk is the risk of loss that may occur when changes in interest rates and public equity prices adversely affect the value of our invested assets.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Interest rate risk is our primary market risk exposure.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can affect the fair value of our investments.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio generally increases when interest rates decrease and decreases when interest rates increase.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The following table summarizes net unrealized gains and losses as of the dates indicated.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our exposure to interest rate changes results from our significant holdings of fixed maturity investments, policy loans and mortgage loans on real estate, all of which comprised over 95.0% of our cash and investment portfolio as of December 31, 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	These investments are mainly exposed to changes in U.S. Treasury rates.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Our fixed maturities investments include U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, U.S. Government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, state and municipal bonds, and corporate bonds.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Approximately 70.8% of the fixed maturities we owned at market value on December 31, 2016 are state and political subdivisions which are primarily municipal holdings.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P2_S4	These holdings are diversified over several states though approximately 40% of our state and municipal securities are concentrated in three states - Texas, Florida and Louisiana.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Changes in interest rates typically have a sizable effect on the fair value of our debt and equities securities.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The interest rate of the ten-year U.S. Treasury bond increased to 2.45% at December 31, 2016 , from 2.27% at December 31, 2015 .
24090_17_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities totaled $26.7 million at December 31, 2016 , compared to $26.5 million at December 31, 2015 , remaining fairly level as bond interest rates have generally lagged the rise in the U.S. Treasury rates.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	To manage interest risk, we perform periodic projections of asset and liability cash flows to evaluate the potential sensitivity of our investments and liabilities.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	We assess interest rate sensitivity on an annual basis with respect to our fixed maturities investments using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward shifts in the prevailing interest rates.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The Company performed an analysis of fair value changes using assumed 100 basis point upward shifts in interest rates, noting that the fair value of our fixed maturity investment portfolio of $1,134.2 million would decrease approximately $56.9 million to a fair value of $1,077.3 million upon a 100 basis point increase.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The following table shows the effects on the fair values of our fixed maturity investments based upon these scenarios.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	While the test scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed-income markets, it is a near-term change that illustrates the potential impact of such events.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Due to the composition of our book of insurance business, we believe it is unlikely we would encounter large surrender activity due to an interest rate increase that would force us to dispose of our fixed maturities at a loss.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Our fixed maturity portfolio is exposed to call risk as a significant portion of the current holdings are callable.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P8_S1	A decreasing interest rate environment can result in increased call activity as experienced over the past several years, and an increasing rate environment will likely result in securities being paid at their stated maturity.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P9_S0	There are no fixed maturities or other investments that we classify as trading instruments.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Approximately 77.7% of fixed maturities were held in available-for-sale and 22.3% in held-to-maturity based upon fair value at December 31, 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM7A_P9_S2	At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had no investments in derivative instruments, subprime loans or CDOs (collateralized debt obligations).
24090_17_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Changes in the level or volatility of equity prices affect the value of equity securities we hold as investments.
24090_17_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Our equity investments portfolio represented 1.5% of our total investments at December 31, 2016 , with 94.4% invested in diversified equity and bond mutual funds.
24090_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	Reference is made to the financial statements, the notes thereto, and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm, as listed on the table of contents.
24090_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	All other schedules have been omitted as the required information is inapplicable or the information required is presented in the financial statements or the notes thereto filed elsewhere herein.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure, among other things, material information relating to our Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is communicated to senior management, including our officers who certify our financial reports, and to the Board of Directors to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and our Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") are responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")).
24090_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based upon an evaluation at the end of the period, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, in light of the material weaknesses described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management of our Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").
24090_17_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 was not effective due to the material weaknesses described below.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Management has identified the following deficiencies that it believes constituted material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016:
24090_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Management determined that the Company had ineffective data validation and management review controls over key spreadsheets and system-generated reports.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P4_S1	These reports included data and information utilized in the preparation of financial statements and disclosures.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P4_S2	We determined that several control deficiencies that exist aggregated to a material weakness related to the design and operating effectiveness of our controls to ensure that key spreadsheets and system-generated reports were properly reviewed for completeness and accuracy.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P4_S3	In addition, certain management review controls were not performed at a sufficiently precise level to identify errors that may result in a material misstatement of the financial statements.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The Company outsourced to third party service providers the valuation of certain insurance reserves and the computation of income taxes.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Management has concluded that the Company s data validation controls over data provided to and received from third party service providers and management review controls were not designed with appropriate levels of precision or sensitivity to ensure that a material misstatement would be prevented or detected in a timely manner.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Management determined that a material weakness exists due to a lack of appropriate internal staff competency and expertise related to complex tax and actuarial computations.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P6_S1	This lack of competency impacted the precision, depth and timeliness of management review controls in these areas, resulting in the possibility that a material misstatement in these computations may not have been prevented or detected in a timely manner.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P7_S1	The report is included in item 9A(c) of this annual report.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries: We have audited Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
24090_17_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting .
24090_17_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P9_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
24090_17_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P9_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P9_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P10_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P10_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P11_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P11_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P12_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P12_S1	The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management s assessment:
24090_17_ITEM9A_P13_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2016 consolidated financial statements of Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P13_S1	These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2016 financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated April 27, 2017 , which expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P14_S0	In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Citizens, Inc. and subsidiaries has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on the COSO criteria.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P15_S0	With the exception of the remediation efforts described below, there were no other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the annual period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P16_S0	During 2016, management identified an ineffective control design related to our information technology ("IT") change management process resulting in a material weakness.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P16_S1	Management learned that unauthorized programming changes could be put into the IT production environment and would possibly not be detected, due to a design deficiency in established monitoring controls.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P16_S2	As of December 31, 2016, the material weakness was fully remediated by implementing a new IT change management control process.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P17_S0	We also have initiated the following remediation efforts to address the identified material weaknesses described above and to enhance our overall financial control environment, though these efforts cannot be considered fully remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively:
24090_17_ITEM9A_P18_S0	Management intends to expand and enhance control procedures during 2017, in all process areas, related to data validation and management review controls.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P19_S0	Management intends to assess effectiveness of current third party service provider relationships during 2017 and increase the precision and sensitivity of data validation controls over data provided to and received from third party service providers.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P20_S0	Management is planning to add additional high level resources to both the Actuarial and Financial Reporting functions during 2017 to increase expertise and develop a more effective review process in these areas.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P21_S0	Management believes the foregoing remedial efforts will effectively remediate the identified material weaknesses but may make further changes deemed appropriate as they implement and monitor the effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures and controls.
24090_17_ITEM9A_P21_S1	If not remediated, these control deficiencies could result in material misstatements to the Company s financial statements.
24090_17_ITEM9B_P0_S0	The information in this Part III indicated below is incorporated by reference from our definitive proxy statement pursuant to General Instruction G(3) of Form 10-K. We plan to file our definitive proxy statement within 120 days after December 31, 2016.
24090_17_ITEM15_P0_S0	(a) (1) and (2) Filings as Part of this Report The financial statements and schedules listed on the following index to financial statements and financial statement schedules are filed under Item 8 as part of this Form 10-K.
24090_17_ITEM15_P1_S0	All other schedules have been omitted because the required information is inapplicable or the information required is presented in the financial statements or the notes thereto filed elsewhere herein.

24090_17_ITEM15_P18_S0	Correction of Immaterial Errors In the course of preparing its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company identified immaterial errors in its previously filed financial statements.
24090_17_ITEM15_P18_S1	The errors were in the Company s accounting for DAC and future policy benefits in the life insurance segment and several other immaterial errors in our other two segments.
24090_17_ITEM15_P18_S2	Two of the errors were discovered in connection with the Company s ongoing conversion of its actuarial valuation from a third party service provider to an actuarial valuation modeling software system purchased from a vendor.
24090_17_ITEM15_P18_S3	The errors in valuing DAC and future policy benefits caused the Company to understate amortization of DAC over several years and to overstate the increase in future policy benefit reserves during the same periods, resulting in an overstatement of DAC of $0.3 million and an overstatement of future policy benefits of $7.9 million at December 31, 2015.
24090_17_ITEM15_P18_S4	There were several other immaterial errors that resulted in negligible impact at December 31, 2015 and 2014.
24090_17_ITEM15_P18_S5	The cumulative errors have been corrected via restatement with a net increase of $3.4 million to retained earnings as of January 1, 2014, the earliest period presented.
24090_17_ITEM15_P18_S6	Correcting the errors resulted in a reduction in the Company s net losses of $436,000 in 2015 and $535,000 in 2014.
24090_17_ITEM15_P19_S0	No. 99, Materiality , and SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements and determined that the errors were immaterial to each of the previously reported periods.
24090_17_ITEM15_P19_S1	However, the Company determined that the adjustment to correct the error, if recorded in 2016 operating results, would materially misstate the 2016 financial statements.
24090_17_ITEM15_P19_S2	Accordingly, we are correcting the errors by restating the prior period information, and therefore have revised the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2015, the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
24090_17_ITEM15_P19_S3	The line item effects of these immaterial error corrections are detailed below.
24090_17_ITEM15_P20_S0	See Note 13 - Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited) for additional information regarding our unaudited quarterly financial information for the year ended December 31, 2015, which information reflects the corrections above.
24090_17_ITEM15_P21_S0	Certain amounts presented in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
24090_17_ITEM15_P22_S0	Investment securities are classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading.
24090_17_ITEM15_P22_S1	Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase.
24090_17_ITEM15_P23_S0	The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities.
24090_17_ITEM15_P23_S1	Fixed maturity securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the Company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity.
24090_17_ITEM15_P23_S2	Securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings until realized.
24090_17_ITEM15_P24_S0	Fixed maturities consist primarily of bonds classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.
24090_17_ITEM15_P24_S1	The Company does not classify any fixed maturities as trading.
24090_17_ITEM15_P24_S2	Equity securities (including non-redeemable preferred stock) are considered available-for-sale and are reported at fair value.
24090_17_ITEM15_P25_S0	Unrealized gains (losses) of equity securities and fixed maturities held as available-for-sale is shown as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of tax, and is a separate component of comprehensive income.
24090_17_ITEM15_P26_S0	The Company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if an other-than-temporary impairment ("OTTI") exists pursuant to the accounting guidelines.
24090_17_ITEM15_P26_S1	In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the ability and intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
24090_17_ITEM15_P26_S2	In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the Federal government or its agencies, by government-sponsored agencies, or whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and reviews of the issuer s financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM15_P27_S0	If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, management must then determine the amount of OTTI to be recognized in earnings.
24090_17_ITEM15_P27_S1	If management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.
24090_17_ITEM15_P27_S2	The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.
24090_17_ITEM15_P27_S3	The amount of OTTI related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_17_ITEM15_P27_S4	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_17_ITEM15_P27_S5	If management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_17_ITEM15_P27_S6	Any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain (as other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold.
24090_17_ITEM15_P28_S0	The Company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions, future market movements, business plan changes, or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time.
24090_17_ITEM15_P29_S0	Mortgage loans on real estate and policy loans are reported at unpaid principal balances.
24090_17_ITEM15_P30_S0	Real estate and other long-term investments consist primarily of land and buildings that are recorded at depreciated cost.
24090_17_ITEM15_P30_S1	If the fair value of the real estate is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized and charged to earnings.
24090_17_ITEM15_P31_S0	Real estate held for sale represents a building we own in Little Rock, Arkansas in which we are a lessor.
24090_17_ITEM15_P31_S1	The building was sold subsequent to December 31, 2016.
24090_17_ITEM15_P32_S0	Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method.
24090_17_ITEM15_P33_S0	Dividend and interest income is recognized when earned.
24090_17_ITEM15_P33_S1	Realized gains and losses are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold.
24090_17_ITEM15_P34_S0	The Company had cash equivalents, fixed maturities and equity securities with an aggregate fair value of $10.0 million and $10.2 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, on deposit with various state regulatory authorities to fulfill statutory requirements.
24090_17_ITEM15_P35_S0	Premiums on life policies are recognized as earned when due.
24090_17_ITEM15_P35_S1	Due premiums on the balance sheet are net of allowances.
24090_17_ITEM15_P36_S0	Accident and health policies are recognized as revenue over the contract period on a pro rata basis.
24090_17_ITEM15_P36_S1	Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in the recognition of profits over the estimated lives of the contracts.
24090_17_ITEM15_P36_S2	This matching is accomplished by means of a provision for future policy benefits and the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_17_ITEM15_P37_S0	Annuity policies, primarily flexible premium fixed annuity products, are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest bearing financial instruments.
24090_17_ITEM15_P37_S1	Premium receipts are not reported as revenue, rather as deposit liabilities to annuity contracts.
24090_17_ITEM15_P37_S2	The annuity products issued do not include fees or other such charges.
24090_17_ITEM15_P38_S0	Acquisition costs, consisting of commissions and policy issuance, underwriting and agent convention expenses that are directly related to and vary with the successful production of new and renewal business, have been deferred.
24090_17_ITEM15_P38_S1	These deferred amounts, referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC"), are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and amortized to income in a systematic manner, based on related contract revenues or gross profits as appropriate.
24090_17_ITEM15_P39_S0	Traditional life insurance and accident and health insurance acquisition costs are being amortized over the premium-paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing future policy benefit liabilities.
24090_17_ITEM15_P39_S1	For universal life type contracts and investment contracts that include significant surrender charges or that yield significant revenues from sources other than the investment contract holders' funds, the deferred contract acquisition cost amortization is matched to the recognition of gross profit.
24090_17_ITEM15_P39_S2	The effect on the DAC asset that would result from realization of unrealized gains or losses is recognized with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income in consolidated stockholders' equity.
24090_17_ITEM15_P40_S0	If an internal replacement of insurance or investment contract modification substantially changes a contract as defined in current accounting guidance, then the DAC is written off immediately through income and any new deferrable costs associated with the new replacement are deferred.
24090_17_ITEM15_P40_S1	If a contract modification does not substantially change the contract, the DAC amortization on the original contract will continue and any acquisition costs associated with the related modification are immediately expensed.
24090_17_ITEM15_P41_S0	We utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance.
24090_17_ITEM15_P41_S1	The factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period.
24090_17_ITEM15_P41_S2	The factor method ensures that policies lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation.
24090_17_ITEM15_P41_S3	The factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value, provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors.
24090_17_ITEM15_P42_S0	Inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred, the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_17_ITEM15_P42_S1	Approximately 94% of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year and renewal excess commissions.
24090_17_ITEM15_P42_S2	The remaining 6% are attributed to costs that vary with and are directly related to the successful acquisition of new insurance business.
24090_17_ITEM15_P42_S3	Those costs generally include costs related to the production, underwriting and issuance of new business.
24090_17_ITEM15_P43_S0	DAC is subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issuance and loss recognition testing on an annual basis, or when an event occurs that might require loss recognition testing.
24090_17_ITEM15_P43_S1	If loss recognition or impairment is necessary, DAC would be written off to the extent that anticipated future premiums and investment income is insufficient to cover expect future policy benefits and expenses.
24090_17_ITEM15_P44_S0	Loss recognition testing that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience calculates the available premium (gross premium less the benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 50 years.
24090_17_ITEM15_P44_S1	The available premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated.
24090_17_ITEM15_P44_S2	The deferred policy acquisition costs are then evaluated for recoverability using best estimate assumptions.
24090_17_ITEM15_P44_S3	Management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value.
24090_17_ITEM15_P45_S0	based upon the analysis performed on capitalized expenses that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business, utilization of the factor method and recoverability testing at the time of policy issuance and the annual loss recognition testing.
24090_17_ITEM15_P46_S0	The components of deferred acquisition costs from year to year are summarized as follows:
24090_17_ITEM15_P47_S0	Cost of customer relationships acquired ("CCRA") is established when we purchase a block of insurance.
24090_17_ITEM15_P47_S1	CCRA is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_17_ITEM15_P47_S2	Inherent in the amortization of CCRA are certain management judgments about the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_17_ITEM15_P47_S3	The assumptions used are based upon interest, mortality and lapses at the time of purchase.
24090_17_ITEM15_P48_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_17_ITEM15_P48_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less the benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 50 years.
24090_17_ITEM15_P48_S2	The CCRA is then evaluated utilizing reasonable assumptions.
24090_17_ITEM15_P48_S3	Management believes that our CCRA and related amortization is recoverable for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
24090_17_ITEM15_P48_S4	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on estimated future results of the block and our annual recoverability testing.
24090_17_ITEM15_P49_S0	Cost of customer relationships acquired relative to purchased blocks of insurance is summarized as follows:
24090_17_ITEM15_P50_S0	Estimated amortization of cost of customer relationship acquired in each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows.
24090_17_ITEM15_P50_S1	Actual future amortization will differ from these estimates due to variances from estimated future withdrawal assumptions.
24090_17_ITEM15_P51_S0	The value of CCRA in our various acquisitions, which is included in cost of customer relationships acquired in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, was determined based on the present value of future profits discounted at annual rates ranging from 3.7% to 8.5% .
24090_17_ITEM15_P52_S0	Future policy benefit reserves for traditional life insurance and accident and health insurance contract benefits and expenses are computed using a net level premium method, with assumptions as to investment yields, dividends on participating business, mortality and withdrawals based upon our experience, modified as necessary to reflect anticipated trends and to include provisions for possible unfavorable deviations.
24090_17_ITEM15_P53_S0	The accrued account balance for non-traditional life insurance and investment contracts is computed as deposits net of withdrawals made by the contract holder, plus amounts credited based on contract specifications, less contract fees and charges assessed, plus any additional interest.
24090_17_ITEM15_P53_S1	Annuity interest crediting rates range from 3.0% to 5.5% annually.
24090_17_ITEM15_P53_S2	Benefits and expenses are charged against the account balance to recognize costs as incurred over the estimated lives of the contracts.
24090_17_ITEM15_P53_S3	Expenses include interest credited to contract account balances and benefits paid in excess of contract account balances.
24090_17_ITEM15_P54_S0	Unpaid claims on accident and health and specialty property insurance policies represent the estimated liability for benefit expenses, both reported but not paid and incurred but not reported to the Company.
24090_17_ITEM15_P54_S1	The liability for incurred but not reported claims includes estimates for additional claim amounts due related to reported claims.
24090_17_ITEM15_P55_S0	claims are estimated using individual case basis valuations and statistical analysis.
24090_17_ITEM15_P55_S1	Those estimates are subject to the effects of trends in claim severity and frequency.
24090_17_ITEM15_P56_S0	Anticipated investment income is not considered in determining whether a premium deficiency exists with respect to short-duration contracts.
24090_17_ITEM15_P57_S0	Premium deposits accrue interest at rates ranging from 3.0% to 8.25% per annum.
24090_17_ITEM15_P57_S1	The cost of insurance is included in the premium when collected and interest is credited annually to deposit accounts.
24090_17_ITEM15_P58_S0	The development of liabilities for future policy benefits requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding mortality, morbidity, lapse, expense, and investment experience.
24090_17_ITEM15_P58_S1	These estimates are based primarily on historical experience and future expectations of mortality, morbidity, expense, persistency, and investment assumptions.
24090_17_ITEM15_P58_S2	Actual results could differ materially from estimates.
24090_17_ITEM15_P58_S3	We monitor actual experience and revise assumptions as necessary.
24090_17_ITEM15_P59_S0	Goodwill is the difference between the purchase price in a business combination and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, and is not amortized.
24090_17_ITEM15_P59_S1	Other intangible assets include various state insurance licenses, which have been determined to have indefinite useful lives and, therefore, are not amortized.
24090_17_ITEM15_P59_S2	Both goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are subject to annual impairment analysis.
24090_17_ITEM15_P60_S0	The goodwill impairment test uses a two-step process as set forth under current accounting guidance.
24090_17_ITEM15_P60_S1	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
24090_17_ITEM15_P60_S2	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment.
24090_17_ITEM15_P60_S3	In the second step, the fair value of projected new business is compared to the carrying value of goodwill.
24090_17_ITEM15_P60_S4	A requirement of this method is that the inforce must pass loss recognition testing.
24090_17_ITEM15_P60_S5	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the fair value of projected new business, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
24090_17_ITEM15_P61_S0	Management s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations based on assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit.
24090_17_ITEM15_P61_S1	Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections.
24090_17_ITEM15_P62_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company had goodwill of $12.6 million allocated to the Life Insurance segment and $4.6 million allocated to the Home Service Insurance segment.
24090_17_ITEM15_P62_S1	The Company completes its annual goodwill assessment for the individual reporting units within the Life Insurance segment and Home Service Insurance segment as of December 31 each year.
24090_17_ITEM15_P62_S2	There was no impairment of goodwill in 2016 , 2015 or 2014 .
24090_17_ITEM15_P63_S0	At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , participating business approximated 62.2% and 61.3% of direct life insurance in force, respectively.
24090_17_ITEM15_P64_S0	Future policy benefits on participating policies are estimated based on net level premium reserves for death and endowment policy benefits with interest rates ranging from 3.0% to 9.0% , and the cash surrender values described in such contracts.
24090_17_ITEM15_P64_S1	The scaling rate used for the 2016 portfolio ranged between 3.19% for 1 year and then going up to 4.45% over 20 years and remaining there for the duration.
24090_17_ITEM15_P65_S0	Earnings and dividends on participating policies are allocated based on policies in force.
24090_17_ITEM15_P66_S0	Policyholder dividends are determined based on the discretion of the Board of Directors of the policy issuing subsidiary.
24090_17_ITEM15_P66_S1	Policyholder dividends are accrued over the premium paying periods of the insurance contract.
24090_17_ITEM15_P67_S0	Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.
24090_17_ITEM15_P67_S1	Diluted earnings per share are computed under the if-converted method for convertible securities and the treasury stock method for warrants, giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock, including options, warrants and convertible/redeemable preferred stock.
24090_17_ITEM15_P67_S2	The basic and diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock are one half the earnings per share of the Class A common stock.
24090_17_ITEM15_P68_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
24090_17_ITEM15_P69_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
24090_17_ITEM15_P69_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered.
24090_17_ITEM15_P70_S0	A deferred tax asset is recorded only if a determination is made that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax treatment on which the deferred tax asset depends will be sustained in the event of an audit.
24090_17_ITEM15_P70_S1	These determinations inherently involve management's judgment.
24090_17_ITEM15_P70_S2	In addition, the Company must record a tax valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
24090_17_ITEM15_P70_S3	This valuation allowance is in essence a contra account to the deferred tax asset.
24090_17_ITEM15_P70_S4	Management must determine the portion of the deferred tax asset and resulting tax benefit that may not be realized based upon judgment of expected outcomes.
24090_17_ITEM15_P71_S0	Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
24090_17_ITEM15_P71_S1	Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to thirty years.
24090_17_ITEM15_P72_S0	We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated life of the improvements.
24090_17_ITEM15_P72_S1	The Company has no capital leases.
24090_17_ITEM15_P73_S0	The following is a summary of property and equipment.
24090_17_ITEM15_P74_S0	Reinsurance recoverable includes expected reimbursements for policyholder claim amounts in excess of the Company's retention, as well as profit sharing and experience refund accruals.
24090_17_ITEM15_P74_S1	Reinsurance recoverable is reduced for estimated uncollectible amounts, if any.
24090_17_ITEM15_P75_S0	Reinsurance premiums, benefits and expenses are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts.
24090_17_ITEM15_P75_S1	The cost of reinsurance related to long duration contracts is accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies.
24090_17_ITEM15_P75_S2	The cost of reinsurance related to short duration contracts is accounted for over the coverage period.
24090_17_ITEM15_P75_S3	Profit-sharing and similar adjustable provisions are accrued based on the experience of the underlying policies.
24090_17_ITEM15_P76_S0	An estimated loss from a contingency is accrued and charged to results of operations only if both of the following conditions are met:
24090_17_ITEM15_P77_S0	Information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable (virtual certainty is not required) that an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred as of the date of the financial statements; and 2.
24090_17_ITEM15_P77_S1	The amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
24090_17_ITEM15_P78_S0	Reasonable estimation of a possible loss does not require estimating a single amount of the loss.
24090_17_ITEM15_P78_S1	It requires that a loss be accrued if it can be estimated within a range.
24090_17_ITEM15_P78_S2	If an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, that amount is accrued.
24090_17_ITEM15_P78_S3	If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
24090_17_ITEM15_P79_S0	A gain contingency is an uncertain situation that will be resolved in the future, possibly resulting in a gain.
24090_17_ITEM15_P79_S1	We do not allow the recognition of a gain contingency prior to settlement of the underlying event.
24090_17_ITEM15_P79_S2	If we were to have a material gain contingency, we would disclose it in the notes to the financial statements.
24090_17_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company considers cash equivalents as all securities whose duration does not exceed 90 days at the date of acquisition.
24090_17_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company considers investments maturing within one year at acquisition as short-term.
24090_17_ITEM15_P81_S1	These securities are carried at amortized cost, which approximates market value.
24090_17_ITEM15_P82_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
24090_17_ITEM15_P82_S1	Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
24090_17_ITEM15_P83_S0	On May 21, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-09, Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts , addressing enhanced disclosure requirements for insurers relating to short-duration insurance contract claims and the unpaid claims liability rollforward for long and short-duration contracts.
24090_17_ITEM15_P83_S1	The disclosures are intended to provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an insurance entity s initial claim estimates and subsequent adjustments to those estimates, the methodologies and judgments used to estimate claims, and the timing, frequency, and severity of claims.
24090_17_ITEM15_P83_S2	The new disclosures required the accumulation and reporting of new and different groupings of claims data than previously reported.
24090_17_ITEM15_P83_S3	For public business entities, the new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
24090_17_ITEM15_P83_S4	See Note 4, Policy Liabilities and Short Duration Contracts below for the new disclosures.
24090_17_ITEM15_P84_S0	No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.
24090_17_ITEM15_P85_S0	The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
24090_17_ITEM15_P85_S1	The guidance provides a five-step process to achieve that core principle.
24090_17_ITEM15_P86_S0	ASU 2014-09 requires disclosures enabling users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
24090_17_ITEM15_P86_S1	Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.
24090_17_ITEM15_P87_S0	ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, using one of two retrospective application methods.
24090_17_ITEM15_P87_S1	We are currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
24090_17_ITEM15_P87_S2	We do not expect that any portion of our revenue will be effected by the new standard, primarily as the new guidance does not apply to revenue from insurance contracts.
24090_17_ITEM15_P87_S3	Our ongoing evaluation process includes identifying contracts that are in the scope of the standard and documenting our accounting for these contracts.
24090_17_ITEM15_P88_S0	The FASB s new lease accounting standard, ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , was issued on February 25, 2016.
24090_17_ITEM15_P88_S1	The ASU will require organizations that lease assets, referred to as lessees , to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases.
24090_17_ITEM15_P88_S2	The ASU also will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
24090_17_ITEM15_P88_S3	These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements, providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements.
24090_17_ITEM15_P89_S0	The accounting by organizations that own the assets leased by the lessee, also known as lessor accounting, will remain largely unchanged from current GAAP.
24090_17_ITEM15_P89_S1	However, the ASU contains some targeted improvements that are intended to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and with the updated revenue recognition guidance issued in 2014.
24090_17_ITEM15_P90_S0	for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
24090_17_ITEM15_P90_S1	The Company is assessing the impact of this new standard.
24090_17_ITEM15_P91_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) , with the main objective to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date.
24090_17_ITEM15_P91_S1	The amendments in this ASU require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.
24090_17_ITEM15_P92_S0	The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset.
24090_17_ITEM15_P92_S1	The income statement reflects the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period.
24090_17_ITEM15_P92_S2	Credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities should be measured in a manner similar to current GAAP; however the credit losses are recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a write-down.
24090_17_ITEM15_P92_S3	This approach is an improvement to current GAAP because an entity will be able to record reversals of credit losses (in situations in which the estimate of credit losses declines) in current period net income, which in turn should align the income statement recognition of credit losses with the reporting period in which changes occur.
24090_17_ITEM15_P92_S4	Current GAAP prohibits reflecting those improvements in current-period earnings.
24090_17_ITEM15_P92_S5	For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
24090_17_ITEM15_P92_S6	The Company is evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
24090_17_ITEM15_P93_S0	No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairmen t.
24090_17_ITEM15_P93_S1	An entity will no longer perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure impairment, eliminating step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.
24090_17_ITEM15_P93_S2	Instead, impairment will be measured using the difference of the carrying amount to the fair value of the reporting unit.
24090_17_ITEM15_P93_S3	The ASU is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods in fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2019, but early adoption is permitted for goodwill impairment tests with measurement dates after January 1, 2017.
24090_17_ITEM15_P94_S0	The Affordable Care Act was passed by the U.S. Congress in 2010.
24090_17_ITEM15_P94_S1	The Company has considered its medical and dental plans provided for employees and agents.
24090_17_ITEM15_P94_S2	While the Company will incur additional costs associated with the implementation of this Act, it does not believe these costs or ongoing costs associated with this Act will have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.
24090_17_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Company does not provide a separate prescription drug plan to its retirees.
24090_17_ITEM15_P95_S1	In addition, the Company does not sell any medical insurance or prescription drug coverage.
24090_17_ITEM15_P95_S2	The Company will continue to assess the information contained in this Act as additional guidance becomes available and as additional implications are understood or clarified.
24090_17_ITEM15_P95_S3	In addition, the Company is monitoring the impact that the new presidential administration and congress will have on this Act.
24090_17_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( the Dodd-Frank Act ) includes a provision to establish a Federal Insurance Office with the primary purpose of collecting information to better understand insurance issues at the federal level and to monitor the extent to which traditional underserved communities and consumers, minorities and low and moderate income persons have access to affordable insurance products.
24090_17_ITEM15_P96_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act also contains provisions affecting financial institutions, credit rating agencies and other commercial and consumer businesses.
24090_17_ITEM15_P96_S2	The Company is monitoring the impact that the new presidential administration and congress will have on this Act.
24090_17_ITEM15_P97_S0	The Company invests primarily in fixed maturity securities, which totaled 89.7% of total investments and cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM15_P97_S1	Holdings in high quality fixed maturity securities rated A or higher by Standard Poor's, Inc. totaled 78.2% of investment holdings in this category, reflecting the conservative investment philosophy of the Company.
24090_17_ITEM15_P98_S0	The cost, gross unrealized gains and losses and fair value of investments in fixed maturities and equity securities, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , are as follows.
24090_17_ITEM15_P99_S0	For investments of available-for-sale fixed maturities that have unrealized losses as of December 31, 2016 , the cost, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer and fair value are as follows.
24090_17_ITEM15_P100_S0	The available-for-sale fixed maturities in a gross unrealized loss position for more than 12 months is primarily related to rises in interest rates which results in lower market prices on fixed maturity securities that have lower coupons than the current market rate.
24090_17_ITEM15_P100_S1	This is interest rate risk and is not a signal of impairment.
24090_17_ITEM15_P100_S2	Management has completed its assessment of other-than-temporary impairment of these securities.
24090_17_ITEM15_P100_S3	Based on our evaluation of the credit worthiness of the issuers and because we do not intend to sell the investments, nor is it likely that we would be required to sell these investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, none of the unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporary.
24090_17_ITEM15_P101_S0	We monitor all debt and equity securities on an on-going basis relative to changes in credit ratings, market prices, earnings trends and financial performance, in addition to specific region or industry reviews.
24090_17_ITEM15_P101_S1	Our impairment review, in accordance with current guidance, is performed by the Company at each reporting date and management uses its best judgment to decide if impairment is other-than-temporary.
24090_17_ITEM15_P101_S2	We determine other-than-temporary impairment by reviewing relevant evidence related to the specific security issuer, as well as our intent to sell the security or whether we more likely than not will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery.
24090_17_ITEM15_P102_S0	All securities with a market price below par were segregated and reviewed as of December 31, 2016 based upon the items above for impairment.
24090_17_ITEM15_P103_S0	For investments of available-for-sale fixed maturities and equity securities that have unrealized losses as of December 31, 2015 , the cost, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer and fair value are as follows.
24090_17_ITEM15_P104_S0	The amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturities at December 31, 2016 by contractual maturity are shown below.
24090_17_ITEM15_P105_S0	Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
24090_17_ITEM15_P106_S0	Securities not due at a single maturity date have been reflected based upon the final stated maturity.
24090_17_ITEM15_P107_S0	The Company had no investments in any one entity which exceeded 10% of stockholders' equity at December 31, 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM15_P107_S1	In addition, there were no investments that were non-income producing for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM15_P108_S0	Major categories of net investment income are summarized as follows:
24090_17_ITEM15_P109_S0	Proceeds and gross realized gains and losses from sales of fixed maturities available-for-sale for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 are summarized as follows:
24090_17_ITEM15_P110_S0	In 2016, SPLIC sold eleven bonds from their available-for-sale portfolio to generate funds to pay the extraordinary dividend to CICA.
24090_17_ITEM15_P110_S1	These sales produced proceeds of $20.6 million and realized gains of $1.5 million .
24090_17_ITEM15_P110_S2	In 2015, there were no sales of fixed maturities available-for-sale.
24090_17_ITEM15_P111_S0	In 2014, two bonds were sold for a gain related to potential impending credit issues.
24090_17_ITEM15_P111_S1	There were no securities sold from the held-to-maturity portfolio in 2016 , 2015 or 2014 .
24090_17_ITEM15_P112_S0	Proceeds and gross realized gains and losses from sales of equity securities for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 are summarized as follows:
24090_17_ITEM15_P113_S0	In 2016 , the Company sold five equity and bond mutual funds, some of which had been previously impaired, that resulted in a net gain of $256,000 to eliminate the risk-based-capital charge associated with equity securities.
24090_17_ITEM15_P114_S0	All mutual funds are considered common stocks for regulatory accounting purposes and the RBC charge for stocks is extremely high.
24090_17_ITEM15_P114_S1	In 2015 , six equity and bond mutual funds were sold that resulted in a net gain of $35,000 due to regulatory accounting considerations.
24090_17_ITEM15_P114_S2	During 2014 , three equity and bond mutual funds were sold resulting in a net loss of $51,000 due to circumstances that arose based on the current environment and due to the fact that they were shorter duration funds.
24090_17_ITEM15_P115_S0	Realized investment gains (losses) are as follows:
24090_17_ITEM15_P116_S0	We recorded OTTI write-downs in 2016 of $4.3 million related to four equity and bond mutual funds and two bond issuers due to credit quality issues that arose in the current year.
24090_17_ITEM15_P117_S0	The Company had realized losses of $12,000 , $111,000 and $525 from calls of fixed maturities in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
24090_17_ITEM15_P118_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
24090_17_ITEM15_P118_S1	We hold fixed maturity and equity securities that are carried at fair value.
24090_17_ITEM15_P119_S0	Fair value measurements are generally based upon observable and unobservable inputs.
24090_17_ITEM15_P119_S1	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.
24090_17_ITEM15_P119_S2	We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
24090_17_ITEM15_P120_S0	All assets and liabilities carried at fair value are required to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
24090_17_ITEM15_P121_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
24090_17_ITEM15_P122_S0	Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose inputs or whose significant value drivers are observable.
24090_17_ITEM15_P123_S0	Level 3 - Instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable.
24090_17_ITEM15_P124_S0	Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as U.S. Treasury securities, publicly traded mutual fund investments and individual stocks.
24090_17_ITEM15_P125_S0	Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued by independent pricing services or broker quotes.
24090_17_ITEM15_P125_S1	These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various inputs, such as interest rates, credit spreads and foreign exchange rates for the underlying financial instruments.
24090_17_ITEM15_P125_S2	All significant inputs are observable, or derived from observable information in the marketplace or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
24090_17_ITEM15_P126_S0	Financial instruments in this category primarily include corporate fixed maturity securities, U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise securities, municipal securities and certain mortgage and asset-backed securities.
24090_17_ITEM15_P127_S0	Level 3 is comprised of financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on non-binding broker prices utilizing significant inputs not based on, or corroborated by, readily available market information.
24090_17_ITEM15_P127_S1	This category consists of two private placement mortgage-backed securities where we cannot corroborate the significant valuation inputs with market observable data.
24090_17_ITEM15_P128_S0	The following table sets forth our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the date indicated.
24090_17_ITEM15_P129_S0	At December 31, 2016 , the fixed maturities, valued using a third-party pricing source, totaled $869.4 million for Level 2 assets and comprised 96.6% of total reported fair value.
24090_17_ITEM15_P129_S1	Fair values for Level 3 assets are based upon unadjusted broker quotes that are non-binding.
24090_17_ITEM15_P130_S0	The Level 1 and Level 2 valuations are reviewed and validated quarterly through random testing by comparisons to separate pricing models, other third party pricing services, and back tested to recent trades.
24090_17_ITEM15_P130_S1	In addition, we obtain information relative to the third party pricing models and review model parameters for reasonableness.
24090_17_ITEM15_P130_S2	For the period ended December 31, 2016 , there were no material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine fair values, and no broker or third party prices were changed from the values received.
24090_17_ITEM15_P131_S0	There were no transfers made between Level 1 and 2 securities at December 31, 2016 or 2015 .
24090_17_ITEM15_P132_S0	Fair values of these securities are based upon quoted market price and are classified as Level 1 assets.
24090_17_ITEM15_P133_S0	The following table presents additional information about fixed maturity securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and for which we have utilized significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs to determine fair value:
24090_17_ITEM15_P134_S0	We review the fair value hierarchy classifications each reporting period.
24090_17_ITEM15_P135_S0	Changes in the observability of the valuation attributes may result in a reclassification of certain financial assets.
24090_17_ITEM15_P135_S1	Such reclassifications, if any, are reported as transfers in and out of Level 3 at the beginning fair value for the reporting period in which the changes occur.
24090_17_ITEM15_P136_S0	Estimates of fair values are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market prices and information about the financial instrument.
24090_17_ITEM15_P136_S1	The estimated fair values of financial instruments presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company might realize in actual market transactions.
24090_17_ITEM15_P136_S2	The carrying amount and fair value for the financial assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at each year-end were as follows:
24090_17_ITEM15_P137_S0	Fair values for fixed income securities, which are characterized as Level 2 assets in the fair value hierarchy, are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar securities.
24090_17_ITEM15_P137_S1	In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other assumptions, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.
24090_17_ITEM15_P138_S0	Mortgage loans are secured principally by residential properties and commercial properties.
24090_17_ITEM15_P138_S1	Weighted average interest rates for these loans were approximately 6.8% and 6.2% per year, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, with maturities ranging from 3 to 26 years.
24090_17_ITEM15_P138_S2	Management estimated the fair value using an annual interest rate of 6.25% at December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
24090_17_ITEM15_P138_S3	Our mortgage loans are considered Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_17_ITEM15_P139_S0	Policy loans have a weighted average annual interest rate of 7.7% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and have no specified maturity dates.
24090_17_ITEM15_P140_S0	These loans typically carry an interest rate that is tied to the crediting rate applied to the related policy and contract reserves.
24090_17_ITEM15_P141_S0	Policy loans are an integral part of the life insurance policies that we have in force and cannot be valued separately and are not marketable.
24090_17_ITEM15_P141_S1	Therefore, the fair value approximates the carrying value and policy loans are considered Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_17_ITEM15_P142_S0	The fair value of short-term investments approximate carrying value due to their short-term nature.
24090_17_ITEM15_P142_S1	Our short-term investments are considered Level 2 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_17_ITEM15_P143_S0	The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximate carrying value and are characterized as Level 1 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_17_ITEM15_P144_S0	The fair value of the Company's liabilities under annuity contract policies, which are considered Level 3 assets, was estimated at December 31, 2016 using discounted cash flows based upon a swap rate curve with interest rates ranging from 1.28% to 3.77% based upon swap rates adjusted for various risk adjustments.
24090_17_ITEM15_P144_S1	The fair value of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in the overall management of interest rate risk, which seeks to minimize exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment maturities with amounts due under insurance contracts.
24090_17_ITEM15_P145_S0	Various assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit reserves of life insurance include the following: a) valuation interest rates from 2.5% to 6.75% per year; b) mortality assumptions are from the 1955 to 1960, 1965 to 1970, 1975 to 1980 and 2001 Select and Ultimate mortality tables; and c) withdrawals are based primarily on actual historical termination rates.
24090_17_ITEM15_P146_S0	The following table presents information on changes in the liability for life, accident and health and property policy and contract claims for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
24090_17_ITEM15_P147_S0	The Company experienced favorable development in 2016 of $493,000 and favorable development in 2015 of $197,000 .
24090_17_ITEM15_P147_S1	No unusual claims or trends have been noted.
24090_17_ITEM15_P148_S0	The Company's short duration contracts consist of credit life and credit disability in the Life segment and property insurance in the Home Service segment.
24090_17_ITEM15_P148_S1	The credit insurance lines are an immaterial part of short duration contracts so the following disclosures cover only the property insurance line of business in the Home Service segment.
24090_17_ITEM15_P149_S0	The following table presents incurred claims development as of December 31, 2016, net of reinsurance, as well as cumulative claim frequency and the total of incurred-but-not-reported liabilities plus expected development on reported claims included within the net incurred claims amounts.
24090_17_ITEM15_P149_S1	This information is presented for the last five years as these claims rarely pay out over a longer period of time.
24090_17_ITEM15_P149_S2	Claims data for 2012 through 2015 is supplementary information to the consolidated financial statements and is unaudited.
24090_17_ITEM15_P150_S0	The following table presents paid claims development as of December 31, 2016, net of reinsurance.
24090_17_ITEM15_P150_S1	Claims data for 2012 through 2015 are unaudited.
24090_17_ITEM15_P151_S0	The reconciliation of the net incurred and paid claims development tables to the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses in the consolidated statement of financial position is as follows.
24090_17_ITEM15_P152_S0	The following is supplementary information to the consolidated financial statements about average historical claims duration as of December 31, 2016.
24090_17_ITEM15_P153_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company reinsures portions of certain policies that we underwrite to limit disproportionate risks.
24090_17_ITEM15_P153_S1	During 2016 and 2015 , we retained varying amounts of individual insurance up to a maximum retention of $100,000 on any life.
24090_17_ITEM15_P153_S2	The Company also reinsures 100% of our accidental death benefit rider coverage.
24090_17_ITEM15_P153_S3	Catastrophe reinsurance is in place for our property policies.
24090_17_ITEM15_P153_S4	In 2016 and 2015 , this reinsurance provided $10,000,000 of coverage above a $500,000 deductible.
24090_17_ITEM15_P154_S0	Our health insurance policies are substantially all reinsured on a 100% coinsurance basis.
24090_17_ITEM15_P154_S1	We remain contingently liable to the extent that the reinsuring companies cannot meet their obligations under these reinsurance treaties.
24090_17_ITEM15_P155_S0	Our amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and reserves ceded to reinsurers.
24090_17_ITEM15_P155_S1	We obtain reinsurance from multiple reinsurers, and we monitor concentration as well as financial strength ratings of our principal reinsurers.
24090_17_ITEM15_P155_S2	The ratings by A.M. Best Company range from B+ (Good) to A+ (Superior).
24090_17_ITEM15_P156_S0	To protect our position, we have established and funded a trust to cover the contingent liabilities related to accident and health reinsurance ceded to Unified Life Insurance Company, which represents $51,000 of the $3.9 million of reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM15_P157_S0	Assumed and ceded life reinsurance activity as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 is summarized as follows:
24090_17_ITEM15_P158_S0	The Company's reinsurance recoveries on ceded reinsurance were $3.9 million in 2016 and $4.2 million in 2015 .
24090_17_ITEM15_P158_S1	Premiums, claims and surrenders assumed and ceded for all lines of business for these years are summarized as follows:
24090_17_ITEM15_P159_S0	SPFIC has catastrophe reinsurance that covers the first event in excess of a $500,000 deductible up to $10.0 million .
24090_17_ITEM15_P159_S1	In consideration for a reinstatement premium, second event coverage is provided in excess of a $500,000 deductible up to $10.0 million .
24090_17_ITEM15_P159_S2	The annual premium was approximately $0.8 million in 2016 , $0.9 million in 2015 and $1.0 million in 2014 .
24090_17_ITEM15_P160_S0	The two classes of our common stock are equal in all respects, except (a) each Class A share receives twice the cash dividends paid on a per share basis to the Class B common stock; and (b) the Class B common stock elects a simple majority of the Board of Directors of Citizens and the Class A common stock elects the remaining directors.
24090_17_ITEM15_P161_S0	The table below shows the combined total of all of our insurance subsidiaries' capital and surplus and net income (loss) for life insurance operations and property insurance operations, although these amounts are not all available as dividends to Citizens, Inc., because only CICA is directly owned by Citizens, Inc.
24090_17_ITEM15_P161_S1	All other subsidiaries are owned by CICA.
24090_17_ITEM15_P162_S0	The 2015 surplus amounts have been corrected.
24090_17_ITEM15_P163_S0	Generally, the net assets of the insurance subsidiaries available for transfer to their immediate parent are limited to the greater of the subsidiary net gain from operations during the preceding year or 10% of the subsidiary net statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_17_ITEM15_P163_S1	Under these practices, total surplus at December 31, 2016 was $31.7 million and net gain from operations was $16.5 million for CICA.
24090_17_ITEM15_P163_S2	Based upon statutory net gain from operations and surplus of CICA as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 , a dividend of approximately $3.2 million could be paid to the Company without prior regulatory approval in 2017 .
24090_17_ITEM15_P163_S3	Payments of dividends in excess of such amounts would generally require approval by regulatory authorities.
24090_17_ITEM15_P164_S0	CICA, CNLIC, SPLIC, MGLIC and SPFIC have calculated their risk based capital ("RBC") in accordance with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' Model Rule and the RBC rules as adopted by their respective states of domicile.
24090_17_ITEM15_P164_S1	All insurance subsidiaries exceeded RBC minimum levels at December 31, 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM15_P165_S0	On June 10, 2016, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) Executive Committee and Plenary voted to adopt a recommendation for January 1, 2017 as the operative date for the implementation of Principles-Based Reserves ( PBR ) as a national standard for life insurance products.
24090_17_ITEM15_P165_S1	Although this NAIC standard does not change the reserving requirements under U.S. GAAP, it can be significant for many life insurers.
24090_17_ITEM15_P166_S0	PBR replaces the current formulaic approach to determining policy reserves with an approach that more closely reflects the risks of highly complex products.
24090_17_ITEM15_P166_S1	Companies will be expected to develop right-sized reserves that better align with their specific product features, their observed actuarial experience, and their overall risk management procedures.
24090_17_ITEM15_P166_S2	There is a three-year transition period where PBR is optional until PBR becomes required on January 1, 2020.
24090_17_ITEM15_P166_S3	The Company is assessing the impact that this standard will have on its statutory reserving and capital and surplus.
24090_17_ITEM15_P167_S0	As of December 31, 2014, we determined that a portion of the life insurance policies issued by our subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") of 1986.
24090_17_ITEM15_P167_S1	This tax code section allows for qualifying products sold to clients to have favorable tax treatment such as the product's inside build up is not taxable.
24090_17_ITEM15_P168_S0	they would qualify for this favorable tax treatment, holders of these policies and CICA may now be subject to additional tax liabilities.
24090_17_ITEM15_P169_S0	The policies at issue were sold most substantially to non-U.S. citizens residing abroad and to a lesser extent domestically.
24090_17_ITEM15_P169_S1	Based upon a review of the options available to the Company, we have determined we will not remediate our endowments and endowment-like products under IRC 7702 we have sold to non-U.S. citizens.
24090_17_ITEM15_P169_S2	We do intend to remediate the domestic products we have sold to U.S. citizens.
24090_17_ITEM15_P169_S3	In addition, as part of our continuing review, we determined in July 2015 that certain annuity contracts do not contain qualifying language under IRC 72(s) as intended that would have provided for favorable tax treatment of the annuities.
24090_17_ITEM15_P169_S4	This issue affects both our domestic and international contract holders.
24090_17_ITEM15_P169_S5	The Company has continued to refine the understanding of the tax failures as previously reported by preparing an individual policy calculation and has reflected the related exposure for the current reporting period as noted below.
24090_17_ITEM15_P169_S6	Failure of these policies to qualify under IRC Sections 7702 and 72(s) has resulted in additional liabilities and expenses as described below.
24090_17_ITEM15_P170_S0	The products have been and continue to be appropriately reported under U.S. GAAP for financial reporting.
24090_17_ITEM15_P171_S0	The failure of these policies to qualify under Sections 7702 and 72(s) results in an estimated liability as of December 31, 2016 of $14.4 million, after tax, related to projected IRS toll charges and fees of $14.1 million as well as claims liability for past claims and reserves increases to bring policies into compliance totaling $0.3 million.
24090_17_ITEM15_P171_S1	The estimated liability at December 31, 2016 is down $0.2 million from the estimated liability at December 31, 2015 of $14.6 million , after tax, due to a continued refinement of our estimate and additional accrued interest charges.
24090_17_ITEM15_P171_S2	The probability weighted range of financial estimates relative to this issue is $7.5 million to $44.8 million , after tax.
24090_17_ITEM15_P171_S3	This estimated range includes projected toll charges and fees payable to the IRS, as well as estimated increased payout obligations to current and former holders of non-compliant domestic life insurance policies expected to result from remediation of those policies.
24090_17_ITEM15_P171_S4	The estimated liability and the estimated range will be updated as we continue to refine our estimates.
24090_17_ITEM15_P171_S5	The amount of our liabilities and expenses depends on a number of uncertainties, including the number of prior tax years for which we may be liable to the IRS, the number of domestic life insurance policies we will be required to remediate, and the methodology applicable to the calculation of taxable benefits under non-compliant policies.
24090_17_ITEM15_P171_S6	Given the range of potential outcomes and the significant variables assumed in establishing our estimates, actual amounts incurred may exceed our reserve and also could exceed the high end of our estimated range of liabilities and expenses.
24090_17_ITEM15_P171_S7	To the extent the amount reserved by the Company is insufficient to meet the actual amount of our liability and expenses, or if our estimates of those liabilities and expenses change in the future, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
24090_17_ITEM15_P171_S8	Management believes that based upon current information we have recorded the best estimate liability to date.
24090_17_ITEM15_P172_S0	Accruals for loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
24090_17_ITEM15_P172_S1	The process of determining our best estimate and the estimated range was a complex undertaking including insight from external consultants and involved management s judgment based upon a variety of factors known at the time.
24090_17_ITEM15_P172_S2	We recorded additional general expenses of $1.9 million in 2016 related to our 7702 and 72(s) issues.
24090_17_ITEM15_P172_S3	Additional costs will be incurred in 2017 associated with these issues and we believe these costs will range from $1.0 million to $2.0 million , but due to the uncertainty of actions we cannot reasonably estimate these costs with any reliability.
24090_17_ITEM15_P172_S4	Actual amounts incurred may exceed this estimate and will be recorded as they become probable and can be reasonably estimated.
24090_17_ITEM15_P173_S0	From time to time we are subject to legal and regulatory actions relating to our business.
24090_17_ITEM15_P173_S1	As a result, we incur defense costs, including attorneys' fees, other direct litigation costs and the expenditure of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_17_ITEM15_P173_S2	If we suffer an adverse judgment as a result of litigation claims, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_17_ITEM15_P174_S0	Some of our top international markets are in countries identified by the U.S. Department of State as jurisdictions of high risk for money laundering.
24090_17_ITEM15_P175_S0	As required by Bank Secrecy Act ( BSA ) regulations applicable to insurance companies, we have developed and implemented an anti-money laundering program that includes policies and procedures for complying with applicable BSA program, reporting and recordkeeping requirements and for deterring, preventing and detecting potential money laundering and other criminal activity ( BSA Program ).
24090_17_ITEM15_P175_S1	Based on a prior internal risk assessment, we have enhanced our BSA Program with additional controls, such as list screening software beyond sanctions screening required by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ( OFAC ), enhanced payment due diligence and transaction controls.
24090_17_ITEM15_P176_S0	Unclaimed Property Contingencies The Company has been informed by the Louisiana Department of Treasury, Arkansas Auditor of State and the Texas State Comptroller, that they authorized an audit of Citizens, Inc. and its affiliates for compliance with unclaimed property laws.
24090_17_ITEM15_P176_S1	This audit is being conducted by Verus Financial LLC on behalf of the states.
24090_17_ITEM15_P177_S0	The external audit may result in additional payments to beneficiaries, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws, administrative penalties, interest, and changes to the Company's procedures for the identification and escheatment of abandoned property.
24090_17_ITEM15_P177_S1	The Company believes additional escheatment of funds in Arkansas or Texas will not be material to our financial condition or results of operations.
24090_17_ITEM15_P177_S2	However, additional escheatment of funds in Louisiana, which may subsequently be deemed abandoned under the Louisiana Department of Treasury s audit, could be substantial for SPLIC if the Louisiana Department of Treasury chooses to disregard recent unclaimed property litigation in favor of the insurance industry.
24090_17_ITEM15_P177_S3	At this time, the Company is not able to estimate any of these possible amounts.
24090_17_ITEM15_P178_S0	We have the following operating lease commitments as of December 31, 2016 with the payments due by the periods indicated below.
24090_17_ITEM15_P179_S0	Operating lease expense was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , and $0.6 million for both periods ended 2015 and 2014 .
24090_17_ITEM15_P180_S0	The Company has three reportable segments: Life Insurance, Home Service Insurance and Other Non-Insurance Enterprises.
24090_17_ITEM15_P180_S1	The accounting policies of the segments are in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are the same as those described in the summary of significant account policies.
24090_17_ITEM15_P181_S0	We evaluate profit and loss performance based on U.S. GAAP net income before federal income taxes for our three reportable segments.
24090_17_ITEM15_P182_S0	The Company has no reportable differences between segments and consolidated operations.

24090_17_ITEM15_P185_S0	The table below summarizes assets by segment.
24090_17_ITEM15_P186_S0	Major categories of earned premiums are summarized as follows:
24090_17_ITEM15_P187_S0	The following table sets forth the Company's annual total of earned premiums from geographic area for the years indicated:
24090_17_ITEM15_P188_S0	Our federal income tax expense was $3.5 million , $1.2 million and $4.0 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
24090_17_ITEM15_P188_S1	This represents effective tax rates of 64.1% , (61.8)% and (206.2)% , respectively.
24090_17_ITEM15_P188_S2	The high effective rate in 2016 was primarily due to the effect of our uncertain tax position and the nondeductible costs to remediate our tax compliance issues.
24090_17_ITEM15_P188_S3	The 2014 impact is the result of costs to remediate the tax compliance issue we identified in early 2015 which impacted the 2014 effective tax rate negatively by approximately $3.5 million due to approximately $ 10.0 million of these costs not being deductible for tax.
24090_17_ITEM15_P188_S4	Additionally, after further refinement of these amounts in 2015 plus the effects of toll charges for the IRC Section 72(s) tax compliance issue identified in the second quarter of 2015, an additional $ 3.3 million of nondeductible toll charges were recorded in 2015, which negatively impacted the 2015 tax rate by $ 1.2 million.
24090_17_ITEM15_P189_S0	The Company holds no valuation allowance in other comprehensive income at December 31, 2016 or 2015 .
24090_17_ITEM15_P190_S0	The table below summarizes the changes in the valuation allowance.
24090_17_ITEM15_P191_S0	A reconciliation of federal income tax expense computed by applying the federal income tax rate of 35% in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 to income (loss) before federal income tax expense is as follows:

24090_17_ITEM15_P199_S0	The Company and our subsidiaries had no net operating losses at December 31, 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM15_P200_S0	At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we determined that as a result of our taxable income in carryback periods, tax planning strategies, and the expected reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized.
24090_17_ITEM15_P201_S0	The Company and our subsidiaries had no capital loss carry-forwards at December 31, 2016 .
24090_17_ITEM15_P202_S0	The Company recognizes only the impact of tax positions that, based on their technical merits, are more likely than not to be sustained upon an audit by the taxing authority.
24090_17_ITEM15_P203_S0	A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
24090_17_ITEM15_P204_S0	This unrecognized tax benefit is reported net in current federal income tax payable in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
24090_17_ITEM15_P204_S1	Included in these amounts is $5.7 million and $3.5 million of interest expense with respect to unrecognized tax benefit as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
24090_17_ITEM15_P205_S0	None of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016 would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.
24090_17_ITEM15_P205_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable possibility the total amount of uncertain tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the next twelve months.
24090_17_ITEM15_P206_S0	The Company s practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
24090_17_ITEM15_P206_S1	In the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), the amount of interest expense recorded was $2.2 million , $0.4 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.

24090_18_ITEM1_P19_S3	In his new role, he will be responsible for leading CICA Life, Ltd. operations, expanding the Company s international footprint globally and implementing strategic changes to the Company s current international business model.
24090_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	Mr. Jorgensen was succeeded at the Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") position by Kay E. Osbourn, who serves as Citizens Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer.
24090_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	Ms. Osbourn was most recently the Company s President.
24090_18_ITEM1_P20_S2	Since joining the Company in 2008, Ms. Osbourn has served in a number of management roles including Vice President, Internal Audit, Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer, President and Interim Chief Executive Officer.
24090_18_ITEM1_P20_S3	Ms. Osbourn has extensive experience in the insurance industry and with the Company.
24090_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	Geoffrey M. Kolander, Citizens current Chief Executive Officer, succeeded Ms. Osbourn as President and now serves in both the role of President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of Citizens, Inc.
24090_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	On October 23, 2017, the Company hired Darin Moore as Interim Chief Information Officer ("CIO").
24090_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	Mr. Moore comes to Citizens with 30 years of technology experience, including life insurance experience at Chubb Life America, Union Central Life, and AFLAC, Inc.

24090_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	Mr. Moore brings Citizens expertise in technology, high volume call center operations, claims payment operations, cybersecurity, project leadership, and software implementation, having extensive experience directing these areas throughout his career.
24090_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	On January 22, 2018, the Company announced its intention to pursue Board diversity.
24090_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	It further announced that Steve Shelton, age 62, independent director and member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, notified the Company of his intention not to stand for re-election as a director at the completion of his current one-year term, which will expire at the Company s 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
24090_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	Mr. Shelton will continue to serve on the Company s Board of Directors and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee until that time.
24090_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	On February 12, 2018, the Company hired Jim Eliasberg as Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary.
24090_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	After graduating from the University of Chicago Law School in 1984, Jim has practiced in the business, transactional and corporate areas, dividing his career between private and in-house practice.
24090_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	Jim has extensive general counsel experience, having served in that role with Taco Cabana, WSNet and, most recently, with Golfsmith.
24090_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	In 2015, we began a process to evaluate the expansion of our international footprint and initiated a strategic analysis of our current international business model.
24090_18_ITEM1_P27_S1	As a result of these strategic initiatives, on May 22, 2017, we incorporated CICA Life Ltd. in Bermuda, as a direct and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
24090_18_ITEM1_P27_S2	On February 23, 2018, CICA Life Ltd. received its Class E, long term insurance license from the Bermuda Monetary Authority ( BMA ) and we capitalized the entity.
24090_18_ITEM1_P27_S3	Bermuda was chosen for its strong regulatory environment and suitability with the Company's priorities to protect our customers.
24090_18_ITEM1_P27_S4	We expect to operate our international business from this entity beginning in 2018 related to current and new business.
24090_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	The Company's Board of Directors and new executive management team are continuing their assessment of the Company's domestic and international business models and business strategies with the assistance and support of external consultants and advisors.
24090_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	Specifically, our evaluation of the Company's international business model is ongoing under the leadership of our new Chief Marketing Officer and CEO.
24090_18_ITEM1_P28_S2	We are focused on (1) new products and our profitability in both the domestic and international markets of our Life Segment as well as our Homes Service Segment; (2) a potential restructuring of our international business and operations; (3) a strategic modernization and upgrade from our legacy technology systems and IT operations with a focus on digitization, our future business needs and cyber risk; (4) effectively operating our international life insurance business offshore in Bermuda through CICA Life, Ltd. (Bermuda); and (5) investment portfolio strategy assessment.
24090_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	A prolonged low interest rate period has required us to reduce the benefits and dividends included under many policies offered internationally.
24090_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	In many cases, our policies provided significantly higher guarantees and dividends than the financial markets might otherwise offer.
24090_18_ITEM1_P29_S2	As such, the Company reduced discretionary dividends on existing international policies in 2016.
24090_18_ITEM1_P29_S3	In 2017, the Company created new repriced products sold internationally to better reflect the prolonged low interest rate environment that we face.
24090_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	The Company reviews its investment strategies routinely to monitor the rate of return.
24090_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	By combining more conservative interest rate features in our insurance policies with a more diversified investment strategy to improve returns on our investment portfolio, we intend to grow bottom line returns to shareholders.
24090_18_ITEM1_P30_S2	There is risk that these changes will result in lower demand for new policies, or that the financial markets will make our investment strategy more difficult.
24090_18_ITEM1_P30_S3	Despite the risks, the Company believes that such strategies are in the best interest of our shareholders.
24090_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	The following pages describe the operations of our two business segments: Life Insurance and Home Service Insurance.
24090_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	CICA Life Insurance Company of America ("CICA"), Citizens National Life Insurance Company ("CNLIC"), constitute the Life segment and Security Plan Life Insurance Company ("SPLIC"), Security Plan Fire Insurance Company ("SPFIC"), Magnolia Guaranty Life Insurance Company ("MGLIC"), comprise the Home Service segment.
24090_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	Revenues derived from any single customer did not exceed 10% of consolidated revenues in any of the last three years.
24090_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	For more information about the financial performance of our business segments, see Note 8 - Segment and Other Operating Information of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
24090_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our Life Insurance segment has historically marketed and issued ordinary whole life insurance in the United States and in U.S. dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents.
24090_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	These contracts are designed to provide a fixed amount of insurance coverage over the life of the insured and can utilize rider benefits to provide additional increasing or decreasing coverage and annuity benefits to enhance accumulations.
24090_18_ITEM1_P33_S2	Additionally, endowment contracts are issued by the Company, which are principally accumulation contracts that incorporate an element of life insurance protection.
24090_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	For the majority of our business, we retain the first $100,000 of risk on any one life, reinsuring the remainder of the risk.
24090_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	We operate this segment through our subsidiaries: CICA Life Insurance Company of America ("CICA") and Citizens National Life Insurance Company ("CNLIC").
24090_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	We focus our sales of U.S. dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies to residents in Latin America and the Pacific Rim.
24090_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , we had insurance policies in force in more than 30 countries, including Colombia, Venezuela, Taiwan, Ecuador and Brazil as our top producing countries.
24090_18_ITEM1_P35_S2	Venezuela one of our top markets, has experienced significant economic and social turmoil recently that has negatively impacted our business in that region.
24090_18_ITEM1_P35_S3	New sales premiums decreased 48.6% from 2016 to 2017.
24090_18_ITEM1_P35_S4	However, renewals by existing policyholders in Venezuela were impacted less significantly with renewal premiums only declining 2.7% from 2016 to 2017.
24090_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	The country's ongoing economic struggles also have resulted in considerable population migration.
24090_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	The migrating population includes many current and prospective customers in our target market demographic profile and we do not anticipate these trends improving in the near term.
24090_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	In 2017 , international direct premiums comprised approximately 95% of total direct premiums in the life segment and 73% of our total direct premiums, and exceeded 10% of our premiums for each of the last three years.
24090_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	We have participated in the foreign marketplace since 1975.
24090_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	We believe positive attributes of our international insurance business include:
24090_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	persistency experience and mortality rates that are comparable to our U.S. policies.
24090_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	We have implemented several policies and procedures to limit the risks of asset and premium loss relating to our international business.
24090_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	Approvals for policy issuance are made in our Austin, Texas office and policies are issued and delivered to the independent consultants, who deliver the policies to the insureds.
24090_18_ITEM1_P40_S2	We have no offices, employees or assets outside of the United States other than the initial capital contribution of CICA Life Ltd. in Bermuda.
24090_18_ITEM1_P40_S3	Insurance policy applications and premium payments are submitted by the independent consultants or customers to us, and we review the applications in our home offices in Austin, Texas.
24090_18_ITEM1_P40_S4	Premiums are paid in U.S. dollars by check, wire or credit card.
24090_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	The policies we issue contain limitations on benefits for certain causes of death, such as homicide in certain high risk international countries.
24090_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	We have also developed disciplined underwriting criteria, which include medical reviews of applicants as well as background and reference checks.
24090_18_ITEM1_P41_S2	In addition, we have a claims policy that requires investigation of substantially all death claims.
24090_18_ITEM1_P41_S3	Furthermore, we perform background reviews and reference checks of prospective independent marketing firms and consultants.
24090_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our independent marketing firms and consultants specialize in marketing life insurance products and generally have several years of insurance marketing experience.
24090_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	We maintain contracts with the independent marketing firms pursuant to which they provide recruitment, training and supervision of their managers and associates in the service and placement of our products.
24090_18_ITEM1_P42_S2	However, all associates of these firms also contract directly with us as independent contractors and receive their compensation directly from us.
24090_18_ITEM1_P42_S3	Accordingly, should an arrangement between any independent marketing firm and us be terminated for any reason, we expect that we would seek to continue the existing marketing arrangements with the associates of these firms.
24090_18_ITEM1_P42_S4	Our agreements with independent marketing firms and consultants typically provide that they are independent contractors responsible for their own operational expenses and are the representative of the prospective insured.
24090_18_ITEM1_P42_S5	In addition, the marketing firms guarantee any debts of their associates to us.
24090_18_ITEM1_P42_S6	The marketing firms receive commissions on all new and renewal policies serviced or placed by them or their associates.
24090_18_ITEM1_P42_S7	All of these contracts provide that the independent marketing firms and consultants are aware of and responsible for compliance with local laws.
24090_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	We offer several ordinary whole life insurance and endowment products designed to meet the needs of our non-U.S. policyowners.
24090_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	These policies have been structured to provide:
24090_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	lifetime income guarantees for an insured or for surviving beneficiaries.
24090_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	Our international products have living benefit features.
24090_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	Every policy contains guaranteed cash values and is participating (i.e., provides for cash dividends as apportioned by the board of directors).
24090_18_ITEM1_P45_S2	Once a policyowner pays the annual premium and the policy is issued, the owner becomes entitled to policy cash dividends as well as annual premium benefits, if the annual premium benefit was elected.
24090_18_ITEM1_P45_S3	According to the policy language, the policyowner has several options with regard to the policy dividends and annual premium benefits.
24090_18_ITEM1_P45_S4	Any annual policy cash dividend may, at the option of the policyowner and provided the value of a dividend is not encumbered by a policy loan, be applied under one of the following options: (1) paid in cash to the policy owner; (2) credited toward payment of premiums on the policy; (3) left with the Company to accumulate at a defined interest rate; (4) applied to increase the amount of insurance benefit by purchase of paid-up additions to the policy; or (5) be assigned to a third party.
24090_18_ITEM1_P45_S5	If the policy is encumbered by a loan, only option 3 will apply to secure the outstanding loan.
24090_18_ITEM1_P45_S6	Similarly, all annual premium benefits credited to the policy may at the option of the policyowner, and provided the policy is not encumbered by a policy loan, be applied under one of the following options: (1) paid in cash to the policy owner; (2) credited toward payment of premiums on the policy; (3) left with the Company to accumulate at an annually company declared interest rate; or (4) be assigned to a third party.
24090_18_ITEM1_P45_S7	Likewise, if the policy is encumbered by a loan, only option (3) will apply to secure the outstanding loan.
24090_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	Under the assigned to a third party provision, the Company has historically allowed policyowners, only after receiving a copy of the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan (the CISIP ) prospectus and acknowledging their understanding of the risks of investing in Citizens stock, the right to assign policy values outside of the policy to the CISIP, which is administered in the United States by Computershare, our plan administrator and transfer agent.
24090_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	The CISIP is a direct stock purchase plan available to our policyowners, our shareholders, our employees, our independent consultants, and other potential investors through the Computershare website.
24090_18_ITEM1_P46_S2	The Company has registered the shares of Class A common stock issuable to participants under the CISIP on a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") that is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
24090_18_ITEM1_P46_S3	Computershare administers the CISIP in accordance with the terms and conditions of the CISIP, which is available on the Computershare website and as part of the Company s registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
24090_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	The life insurance business is highly competitive.
24090_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	We compete with a large number of stock and mutual life insurance companies internationally and domestically, as well as with financial institutions that offer insurance products.
24090_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	There are more than 800 life insurance companies in the United States, some of which also provide insurance to foreign residents.
24090_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	We face competition primarily from companies formed and operated in the country in which the insureds reside, from companies that operate in the same manner as we do and from companies that are foreign to the countries in which policies are sold, but issue insurance policies denominated in the local currency of those countries.
24090_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	A substantial number of companies may be deemed to have a competitive advantage over us due to their significantly greater financial resources, histories of successful operations and larger marketing forces.
24090_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	Because premiums on our international policies are paid in U.S. dollars, and we pay claims and benefits in U.S. dollars, we provide a product that is different from the products offered by foreign-domiciled companies.
24090_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	We believe our international policies are usually acquired by individuals in the upper middle class in their respective countries and those with significant net worth and earnings that place them in the upper income brackets of their respective countries.
24090_18_ITEM1_P51_S2	The policies sold by our foreign competitors are generally offered broadly and are priced using the mortality of the entire population of the geographic region.
24090_18_ITEM1_P51_S3	Our mortality charges are typically lower due to our customer demographics, which provides a competitive advantage.
24090_18_ITEM1_P51_S4	Additionally, the assets backing the reserves for our foreign competitors' policies must be substantially invested in their respective countries and, therefore, are exposed to the inflationary risks and social or economic crises that have been more common in these foreign countries.
24090_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	In 2017 , domestic direct premiums comprised approximately 5% of total direct premiums in the life segment and 3% of our total direct premiums.
24090_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	The majority of our domestic inforce business results from blocks of business of insurance companies we have acquired over the past 19 years.
24090_18_ITEM1_P52_S2	We discontinued new sales of our non-home service domestic products beginning January 1, 2017.
24090_18_ITEM1_P52_S3	These sales represented approximately 1% of total new business in 2016 for the life segment and is considered immaterial to our business.
24090_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	Under the direction of our new CMO, we are reviewing our domestic strategy.
24090_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	Our domestic life insurance products have historically focused primarily on living needs and provided benefits focused toward accumulating financial benefits for the policyowner.
24090_18_ITEM1_P54_S1	The features of our domestic life insurance products include:
24090_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	an option to waive premium payments in the event of disability.
24090_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	Our life insurance products have historically been designed to address the insured's concern about outliving his or her monthly income, while at the same time providing death benefits.
24090_18_ITEM1_P56_S1	The primary purpose of our product portfolio is to help the insured create capital for needs such as retirement income, children's higher education funds, business opportunities, emergencies and health care needs.
24090_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	Our domestic Home Service segment operates through our subsidiaries Security Plan Life Insurance Company ("SPLIC"), Magnolia Guaranty Life Insurance Company ("MGLIC") and Security Plan Fire Insurance Company ("SPFIC"), and focuses on the life insurance needs of the middle and lower income markets, primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	Our policies are sold and serviced through a home service marketing distribution system of approximately 307 employee-agents who work on a route system and through over 350 funeral homes and independent agents to sell policies, collect premiums and service policyholders.
24090_18_ITEM1_P57_S2	To a lesser extent, our Home Service segment sells limited liability, named peril property policies covering dwelling and contents.
24090_18_ITEM1_P57_S3	In 2017 , our Home Service segment comprised 24% , or $47.8 million of our total direct premiums.
24090_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	Our home service insurance products consist primarily of small face amount ordinary whole life and pre-need policies, which are designed to fund final expenses for the insured, primarily consisting of funeral and burial costs.
24090_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	The average life insurance policy face amount issued was approximately $6,800 in 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	Due to the lower risk associated with small face amount polices, the underwriting performed on these applications is limited.
24090_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	Our property coverages are limited to $30,000 maximum coverage on any one dwelling and contents, while content-only coverage and dwelling-only coverage is limited to $20,000 .
24090_18_ITEM1_P59_S2	We face competition in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas from other companies specializing in home service distribution of insurance.
24090_18_ITEM1_P59_S3	We seek to compete based upon our emphasis on personal service to our customers.
24090_18_ITEM1_P59_S4	We intend to continue premium growth within this segment via direct sales and acquisitions.
24090_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	Other Non-insurance Operations includes Computing Technology, Inc., which provides data processing services to the Company, and Insurance Investors, Inc., which provided aviation transportation to the Company until the company-owned airplane was sold during 2017.
24090_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	This operating unit includes the results of Citizens, Inc., the parent Company.
24090_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	Our administrative operations principally serve our life insurance segment and are conducted primarily at our executive offices in Austin, Texas through approximately 136 administrative, operating and underwriting personnel.
24090_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	At our executive offices, we also perform policy design, marketing oversight, underwriting, accounting and reporting, actuarial, customer service, claims processing, administrative and investing activities.
24090_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	We have a single integrated information technology system for our entire Company, which is a centrally-controlled, mainframe-based administrative system.
24090_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	Functions of our policy administrative system include policy set up, administration, billing and collections, commission calculation, valuation, automated data edits, storage backup, image management and other related functions.
24090_18_ITEM1_P64_S2	Each company we acquire is ultimately converted onto our administrative system.
24090_18_ITEM1_P64_S3	This system has been in place for more than 30 years and has been updated on an ongoing basis as technology has evolved.
24090_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	We are currently reviewing technology options to transition from our legacy administration system to an upgraded, modernized technology platform that will service our needs into the future.
24090_18_ITEM1_P65_S1	On February 1, 2017, we went live with a modernized claims system.
24090_18_ITEM1_P65_S2	We are also currently converting our actuarial valuation from a third party service provider to an actuarial valuation modeling software system purchased from a vendor.
24090_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	The Company has an enterprise risk management function ( ERM ) that analyzes the Company s risks on an individual and aggregated basis and is responsible for ensuring that the Company s risks remain within its risk appetite and tolerances as determined by management with oversight from the Audit Committee.
24090_18_ITEM1_P66_S1	The Company's focus on ERM strengthens its risk management culture and discipline.
24090_18_ITEM1_P66_S2	The mission of ERM is to support the Company in achieving its strategic priorities by:
24090_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	Providing insight to assist in growing the businesses and achieving optimal risk-adjusted returns within established guidelines.
24090_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	Effective risk oversight is an important priority for the Company s Board of Directors and senior management team.
24090_18_ITEM1_P68_S1	While it is the job of the CEO and senior management to assess and manage the Company s risk exposure through ERM, in accordance with NYSE requirements, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is charged with discussing guidelines and policies to govern the process by which ERM is handled.
24090_18_ITEM1_P68_S2	The Audit Committee periodically discusses the Company s major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures.
24090_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	The five broad categories of risk exposures assessed and managed by senior management include, but are not limited to:
24090_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	Any other risk that poses a material threat to the operational and/or strategic viability of the Company.
24090_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	In addition to the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee considers the risks and rewards that may be implicated by our executive compensation philosophy and programs, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees the Company s governance practices, director succession and committee composition and leadership to manage risks associated with corporate governance.
24090_18_ITEM1_P71_S1	Although risk oversight is conducted primarily through committees of the Board, the full Board has retained responsibility for general oversight of risks.
24090_18_ITEM1_P71_S2	The Board satisfies this responsibility through full reports by each committee chair regarding the committees considerations and actions, as well as through regular reports directly from officers responsible for oversight of particular risks within the Company.
24090_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	Our U.S. insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations.
24090_18_ITEM1_P72_S1	State insurance laws establish supervisory agencies with broad regulatory authority to regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of each state in which they are licensed.
24090_18_ITEM1_P72_S2	In addition, U.S. laws, such as the USA Patriot Act of 2001, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("the Dodd-Frank Act") and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, are examples of U.S. regulations that affect our business.
24090_18_ITEM1_P72_S3	We are subject to comprehensive regulations under the USA Patriot Act and the Bank Secrecy Act with respect to money laundering, as well as federal regulations regarding privacy and confidentiality.
24090_18_ITEM1_P72_S4	Our insurance products and thus our businesses also are affected by U.S. federal, state and local tax laws.
24090_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act focuses on financial reform and has resulted in changes to the regulation of institutions operating in the financial services industry, including the Company.
24090_18_ITEM1_P73_S1	Its requirements include streamlining the state-based regulation of reinsurance and non-admitted insurance (also known as surplus lines insurance, which is property or casualty insurance written by a company that is not licensed to sell policies of insurance in a given state) and establishing a new Federal Insurance Office ("FIO") within the U.S. Department of the Treasury with powers over all lines of insurance except health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance.
24090_18_ITEM1_P73_S2	The FIO is authorized to, among other things, gather data and information to monitor aspects of the insurance industry, identify issues in the regulation of insurers about insurance matters and preempt state insurance measures under certain circumstances.
24090_18_ITEM1_P73_S3	However, the FIO s limited monitoring abilities posed minimal risk to the insurance industry and the Dodd-Frank Act has had no significant impact on our business, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources.
24090_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	The rulemaking process going forward may change with the current presidential administration.
24090_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	The purpose of the laws and regulations that affect our insurance business is primarily to protect our insureds and not our stockholders.
24090_18_ITEM1_P75_S1	Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations.
24090_18_ITEM1_P75_S2	In addition, insurance regulatory authorities (including state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general) periodically make inquiries and regularly conduct examinations regarding compliance by us and our subsidiaries with insurance, and other laws and regulations regarding the conduct of our insurance businesses.
24090_18_ITEM1_P75_S3	It is our practice to fully and consistently cooperate with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action when warranted.
24090_18_ITEM1_P76_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are collectively licensed to transact business in 32 states.
24090_18_ITEM1_P76_S1	We have insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the states of Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.
24090_18_ITEM1_P76_S2	Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are licensed and regulated in all U.S. jurisdictions in which they conduct insurance business.
24090_18_ITEM1_P76_S3	The extent of this regulation varies, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations based upon the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) model rules governing the financial condition of insurers, including standards of solvency, types and concentration of investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, credit for reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy, and the business conduct of insurers, including marketing and sales practices and claims handling.
24090_18_ITEM1_P76_S4	In addition, statutes and regulations usually require the licensing of insurers and their agents, the approval of policy forms and related materials and the approval of rates for certain types of insurance products.
24090_18_ITEM1_P77_S0	All U.S. jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries conduct insurance business have enacted legislation that requires each U.S. insurance company in a holding company system, except captive insurance companies, to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its jurisdiction of domicile and to furnish that regulatory authority with financial and other information concerning the operations of, and the interrelationships and transactions among, companies within its holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system.
24090_18_ITEM1_P77_S1	These laws and regulations also regulate transactions between insurance companies and their parents and affiliates.
24090_18_ITEM1_P77_S2	Generally, these laws and regulations require that all transactions within a holding company system between an insurer and its affiliates be fair and reasonable and that the insurer's statutory capital and surplus following any transaction with an affiliate be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.
24090_18_ITEM1_P77_S3	For certain types of agreements and transactions between an insurer and its affiliates, these laws and regulations require prior notification to, and non-disapproval or approval by, the insurance regulatory authority of the insurer's jurisdiction of domicile.
24090_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	Generally, all foreign countries in which we offer insurance products require a license or other authority to conduct insurance business in that country.
24090_18_ITEM1_P78_S1	Some of these countries also require that local regulatory authorities approve the terms of any insurance product sold to residents of that country.
24090_18_ITEM1_P78_S2	We have never qualified to do business in any foreign country and have never submitted our insurance policies issued to residents of foreign countries for approval by any foreign or domestic insurance regulatory agency.
24090_18_ITEM1_P79_S0	We have undertaken a comprehensive compliance review of risks associated with the potential application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in foreign countries.
24090_18_ITEM1_P80_S0	The application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in foreign countries varies by country.
24090_18_ITEM1_P80_S1	There is a lack of uniform regulation, lack of clarity in certain regulations and lack of legal precedent in addressing circumstances similar to ours.
24090_18_ITEM1_P80_S2	Our compliance review has confirmed the previously disclosed risks related to foreign insurance laws associated with our current business model, at least in certain jurisdictions, as described in detail in Item 1A - Risk Factors - Risks Relating to our Business.
24090_18_ITEM1_P80_S3	We are exploring alternatives to our current business model in one or more jurisdictions, including withdrawing from particular markets.
24090_18_ITEM1_P80_S4	We cannot assure you that any of these laws, regulations, or application of them by foreign regulatory authorities, or any change in our business model, will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products through our independent marketing consultants and, in turn, on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1_P81_S0	The payment of dividends or other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by the insurance laws and regulations of their respective state or country of domicile.
24090_18_ITEM1_P81_S1	The laws and regulations of some of these jurisdictions also prohibit an insurer from declaring or paying a dividend except out of its earned surplus or require the insurer to obtain regulatory approval before it may do so.
24090_18_ITEM1_P81_S2	In addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employee or other services) if they determine such payment could be adverse to policyholders or insurance contract holders of the subsidiary.
24090_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled require that a controlling party obtain the approval of the insurance commissioner of the insurance company's jurisdiction of domicile prior to acquiring control of the insurer and may delay, deter or prevent a transaction our shareholders might consider desirable.
24090_18_ITEM1_P83_S0	Risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements are imposed on life and property and casualty insurance companies.
24090_18_ITEM1_P83_S1	The NAIC has established minimum capital requirements in the form of RBC.
24090_18_ITEM1_P83_S2	RBC requirements weight the type of business written by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company's business to develop a minimum level of capital called "authorized control level risk-based capital" and compares this level to adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves.
24090_18_ITEM1_P83_S3	Should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk-based capital fall below 200%, a series of actions would be required by the affected company, including submitting a capital plan to the Department of Insurance in the insurance company's state of domicile.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investing in our Company involves certain risks.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Set forth below are certain risks with respect to our Company.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Readers should carefully review these risks, together with the other information contained in this report.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties we have described in this report are not the only ones we face.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem not material, may also adversely affect our business.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Any of the risks discussed in this report or that are presently unknown or not material, if they were to actually occur, could result in a significant adverse impact on our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	References in the risk factors below to "we," "us," "our," "Citizens" and like terms relate to Citizens, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statement basis, unless specifically identified otherwise.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We operate our subsidiaries as separate and distinct entities with respect to corporate formalities.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The majority of our sales derive from residents of foreign countries and is subject to risks associated with political instability, currency control laws and foreign insurance laws.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	A significant loss of sales in these foreign markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The majority of our direct premiums, approximately 73% in 2017 , are from foreign countries, primarily those in Latin America and the Pacific Rim.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	These sales are made through independent consultants who are located in these foreign countries.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of these countries have a history of political instability, including regime changes, political uprisings, currency fluctuations and anti-democratic or anti-U.S. policies.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	There is a risk that political instability in these countries could have a material adverse effect on the ability of people living in these countries to purchase our insurance policies or our ability to sell our policies in those countries through our independent consultants or otherwise.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Our Company s future sales and financial results depend upon avoiding significant regulatory restraints on receiving insurance policy applications and premiums from, and issuing insurance policies to, residents outside of the United States.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Currency control laws or other currency exchange restrictions in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our revenues by imposing restrictions on asset transfers outside of a country where our insureds reside.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies to U.S. dollars in certain countries could prevent our insureds in those countries from purchasing or paying premiums on our policies.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	There can be no assurance that such restrictions will not be imposed and that our revenues, results of operations and financial condition will not be materially adversely affected if they do occur.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We also face risks associated with the application of foreign laws to our sales of policies to residents in foreign countries.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Generally, all foreign countries in which we offer insurance products require a license or other authority to conduct insurance business in that country.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Some of these countries also require that local regulatory authorities approve the terms of any insurance product sold to residents of that country.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	We have never sought to qualify to do business in any foreign country and have never submitted the insurance policies that we issue to residents of foreign countries for approval by any foreign or domestic insurance regulatory agency.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Traditionally, we have sought to address risks associated with the potential application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in our foreign markets by, among other things, not locating any of our offices or assets in foreign countries, selling policies only through independent consultants rather than our own employees, requiring that all applications for insurance be submitted to and accepted only in our offices in the U.S., and requiring that policy premiums be paid to us only in U.S. Dollars.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P7_S5	We rely on our independent consultants to comply with laws applicable to them in marketing our insurance products in their respective countries.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We have undertaken a comprehensive compliance review of risks associated with the potential application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in foreign countries.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in foreign countries varies by country.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	There is a lack of uniform regulation, lack of clarity in certain regulations and lack of legal precedent addressing circumstances similar to ours.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Our compliance review has confirmed the previously disclosed risks related to foreign insurance laws associated with our current business model, at least in certain foreign countries.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	There are risks that a foreign government could determine under its existing laws that its residents may not purchase life insurance from us unless we become qualified to do business in that country or unless our policies purchased by its residents receive prior approval from its insurance regulators.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P9_S4	There also is a risk that foreign regulators may become more aggressive in enforcing any perceived violations of their laws and seek to impose monetary fines, criminal penalties, and/or order us to cease our sales in that jurisdiction.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P9_S5	There is no assurance that, if a foreign country were to deem our sales of policies in that country to require that we qualify to do business in that country or submit our policies for approval by that country s regulatory authorities, we would be able to, or would conclude that it is advisable to, comply with those requirements.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Any determination by a foreign country that we or our policy sales are subject to regulation under their laws, or any actions by a foreign country to enforce such laws more aggressively, could therefore have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell policies in that country and, in turn, on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P9_S7	We are exploring alternatives to our current business model in one or more jurisdictions, including withdrawing from particular markets.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Any disruption to the marketing and sale of our policies to residents of a foreign country, resulting from the action of foreign regulatory authorities or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our operating results and financial condition may be affected if the liabilities actually incurred differ, or if our estimates of those liabilities change, from the amounts we have reserved for in connection with the noncompliance of a portion of our life insurance policies with Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code and the failure of certain annuity contracts to qualify under Section 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We previously announced that we determined that a portion of the life and annuity insurance policies issued by our subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702 and 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") of 1986.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We may be liable to the IRS for failure to withhold taxes or to tax report on IRS information returns and payee statements.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We have undertaken an analysis of our potential liability to the IRS arising from this matter, as well as other expenses we may incur to remediate (i.e., conform to the requirements of the IRS) certain previously issued domestic life insurance and annuity policies and to address any missed reporting and withholding for policies issued to non-U.S. citizens and have established a best estimate reserve of $ 12.3 million, net of tax as of December 31, 2017 for probable liabilities and expenses.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The probability weighted range of financial estimates relative to this issue is $5.9 million to $48.2 million , net of tax.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	This estimated range includes projected toll charges and fees payable to the IRS, as well as estimated increased payout obligations to current holders of non-compliant domestic life insurance policies expected to result from remediation of those policies.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P12_S5	The amount of our liabilities and expenses depends on a number of uncertainties, including the number of prior tax years for which we may be liable to the IRS, the number of domestic life insurance policies we will be required to remediate, the methodology applicable to the calculation of toll charges for non-compliant policies and the amount of time and resources we will require from external advisors who are assisting us with resolving these issues.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	significant variables assumed in establishing our estimates, actual amounts incurred may exceed our reserve and also could exceed the high end of our estimated range of liabilities and expenses.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	To the extent the amount reserved is insufficient to meet the actual amount of our liabilities and expenses, or if our estimates of those liabilities and expenses change in the future, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	On May 17, 2017, we submitted an offer to enter into Closing Agreements with the IRS covering the CICA and CNLIC domestic life insurance business.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The toll charges calculated and enumerated in the Closing Agreements totaled $124,000 and $4,000 for the CICA and CNLIC domestic life insurance businesses, respectively.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We expect to submit offers to enter into Closing Agreements with the IRS for the SPLIC and MGLIC life insurance business and for the CICA international business and our annuity business in 2018.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The new CICA Life Ltd. (Bermuda) will be subject to extensive government regulation by the Bermuda Monetary Authority ( BMA ), which is a new regulatory regime for the Company.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Regulation by the BMA, is subject to change and may increase our costs of doing business, restrict the conduct of our business and negatively impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	For over 40 years, the Company s life insurance subsidiaries have been regulated in the U.S. by the state insurance departments of their states of domicile.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In 2018, CICA Life Ltd. will be subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the BMA in jurisdictions where we do business, including global insurance regulations, tax, financial services, privacy, anti-money laundering, bank secrecy, anti-corruption and foreign asset control laws.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Bermuda insurance company regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, with substantially lesser protections to shareholders of the regulated insurance companies.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	To that end, the BMA has broad powers to regulate business activities of CICA Life Ltd, mandate capital and surplus requirements, regulate trade and claims practices and require strong enterprise risk management and corporate governance activities.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The Company has no prior experience operating in a foreign jurisdiction and limited experience with regulation by the BMA.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We face financial, liquidity and capital market risks in our operations.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	As an insurance holding company with significant investment exposure, we face material financial and capital markets risk in our operations.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Due to the low interest rate environment in recent years, we experienced significant call activity on our fixed income portfolio that decreased our investment yields compared to prior years.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We also have recorded other-than-temporary impairments in the past several years due to credit related market declines and equity market volatility.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We face potential liquidity risks if policyholders with mature policies elect to receive lump sum distributions at greater levels than anticipated.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our whole life and endowment products provide the policyholder with alternatives once the policy matures.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	The policyholder can choose to take a lump sum payout or leave the money on deposit at interest with the Company.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The Company has a significant amount of endowment products representing approximately 45.9% of total inforce with older contracts sold historically that will begin reaching their maturities over the next several years and policyholder election behavior is not known.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P21_S4	If policyholders elect lump sum distributions, the Company could be exposed to liquidity risk in years of high maturities.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Meeting these distributions could require the Company to sell securities at inopportune times to pay policyholder withdrawals.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Alternatively, if the policyholder were to leave the money on deposit with the Company at interest, our profitability could be negatively impacted if the product guaranteed rate is higher than the current market rate we can earn on our investments.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	A large portion of our debt security investment portfolio will mature in the next seven years and could be called sooner as we were subject to significant call activity beginning in 2009 due to the declining interest rate environment and we reinvested into shorter durations that are now approaching maturity.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We will need to reinvest these maturing funds in the current interest rate environment.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Our profitability could be negatively impacted depending on the market rates at the time of reinvestment.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	This could result in a decrease in our spread between our policy liability crediting rates and our investment earned rates.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	This could also negatively impact our liquidity.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Changes in market interest rates may significantly affect our profitability.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Some of our products, principally traditional whole life insurance with annuity riders, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our "spread," or the difference between the amounts we are required to pay under our contracts to policyholders and the rate of return we are able to earn on our investments intended to support obligations under the contracts.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our spread is an integral component of our net income.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	If interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured, prepaid, been sold, or called at lower yields, reducing our investment margin.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our fixed income bond portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk as approximately 55% of the portfolio is callable.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Lowering our interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in investment margins on some of our products.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	However, our ability to lower these rates could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates, and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	An increase in interest rates will decrease the net unrealized gain position of our investment portfolio and may subject us to disintermediation risk.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Disintermediation risk is the risk that in a change from a low interest rate period to a significantly higher and increasing interest rate period, policyholders may surrender their policies or make early withdrawals in order to increase their returns, requiring us to liquidate investments in an unrealized loss position (i.e. the market value less the carrying value of the investments).
24090_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	This risk is discussed further in the two risk factors below.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our investment portfolio is subject to various risks that may result in realized investment losses.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In particular, decreases in the fair value of fixed maturities may significantly reduce the value of our investments, and as a result, our financial condition may suffer.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations under these securities could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in the recognition of investment losses.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the bonds included in our portfolio and by other factors that may result in the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In particular, at December 31, 2017 , fixed maturities represented $1,208.6 million or 92.5% of our total investments of $1,306.1 million .
24090_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The fair value of fixed maturities and the related investment income fluctuates depending on general economic and market conditions.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The fair value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us will generally increase or decrease in line with changes in market interest rates.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	An investment has prepayment risk when there is a risk that the timing of cash flows resulting from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The impact of value fluctuations affects our consolidated financial statements, as a large portion of our fixed maturities are classified as available-for- sale, with changes in fair value reflected in our stockholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss).
24090_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	No similar adjustment is made for liabilities to reflect a change in interest rates.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Therefore, interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect our stockholders' equity, total comprehensive income and/or cash flows.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Although at December 31, 2017 , approximately 97.2% of our fixed maturities were investment grade with 75.2% rated A or above, all of our fixed maturities are subject to credit risk.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P33_S4	If any of the issuers of our fixed maturities suffer financial setbacks, the ratings on the fixed maturities could be downgraded (with a concurrent decrease in fair value) and, in a worst-case scenario, the issuer could default on its financial obligations.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P33_S5	If the issuer defaults, we could have realized losses associated with the impairment of the securities.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Valuation of our investments and the determination of whether a decline in the fair value of our invested assets is other-than-temporary are based on estimates that may prove to be incorrect.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	U.S. GAAP requires that when the fair value of any of our invested assets declines and the decline is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we recognize a loss in either other comprehensive income or in our statement of income based on certain criteria in the period for which the determination is made.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The determination of the fair value of certain invested assets, particularly those that do not trade on a regular basis, requires an assessment of available data and the use of assumptions and estimates.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Once it is determined that the fair value of an asset is below its carrying value, we must determine whether the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, which is based on subjective factors and involves a variety of assumptions and estimates.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	There are risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in market value are other-than-temporary.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	These include significant changes in general economic conditions and business markets, trends in certain industry segments, interest rate fluctuations, rating agency actions, changes in significant accounting estimates and assumptions and legislative actions.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In the case of mortgage- and asset-backed securities, there is added uncertainty as to the performance of the underlying collateral assets.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	To the extent that we are incorrect in our determination of the fair value of our investment securities or our determination that a decline in their value is other-than-temporary, we may realize losses that never actually materialize or may fail to recognize losses within the appropriate reporting period.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities may be realized or result in future impairments, resulting in a reduction in our net income.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and are, therefore, excluded from our net income.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Our total gross unrealized losses on our available-for-sale securities portfolio at December 31, 2017 were $ 3.1 million .
24090_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	The accumulated change in estimated fair value of these securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is realized upon sale of the security or in the event that the decline in estimated fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary and an impairment charge to earnings is taken.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Realized losses or impairments may have a material adverse effect on our net income in a particular quarterly or annual period.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, and we may be required to establish additional reserves, which in turn may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We maintain reserves to cover our estimated exposure for claims relating to our issued insurance policies.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Reserves, whether calculated under U.S. GAAP or statutory accounting practices prescribed by various state insurance regulators, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections, of what we expect claims will be based on mortality assumptions that are determined by various regulatory authorities.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Many reserve assumptions are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P43_S3	In addition, when we acquire other domestic life insurance companies, our assessment of the adequacy of acquired policy liabilities is subject to our estimates and assumptions.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops, and adjustments to reserves are reflected in our statements of operations for the period in which such estimates are updated.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, future developments may require us to increase policy benefit reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the periods in which such increases occur.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Unanticipated increases in early policyholder withdrawals or surrenders could negatively impact liquidity.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	A primary liquidity concern is the risk of unanticipated or extraordinary early policyholder withdrawals or surrenders.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Our insurance policies include provisions, such as surrender charges, that help limit and discourage early withdrawals, and we track and manage liabilities and attempt to align our investment portfolio to maintain sufficient liquidity to support anticipated withdrawal demands.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	However, early withdrawal and surrender levels may differ from anticipated levels for a variety of reasons, including changes in economic conditions, changes in policyholder behavior or financial needs, changes in relationships with our independent consultants, changes in our claims-paying ability, or increases in surrenders among policies that have been in force for more than fifteen years and are no longer subject to surrender charges.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our liquidity, profitability and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	While we own a significant amount of liquid assets, a certain portion of investment assets are relatively illiquid.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	If we experience unanticipated early withdrawal or surrender activity, we could exhaust all other sources of liquidity and be forced to obtain additional financing or liquidate assets, perhaps on unfavorable terms.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P46_S2	The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the availability of credit in general or more specifically in the insurance industry, the strength or weakness of the capital markets, the volume of trading activities, our credit capacity, and the perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large realized or unrealized investment losses or if the level of business activity declines due to a market downturn.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P46_S3	If we are forced to dispose of assets on unfavorable terms, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Catastrophes may adversely impact liabilities for policyholder claims and reinsurance availability.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic events.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and man-made catastrophes may produce significant damage or loss of life in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Claims resulting from catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	In addition, catastrophic events could harm the financial condition of issuers of obligations we hold in our investment portfolio, resulting in impairments to these obligations, and the financial condition of our reinsurers, thereby increasing the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Large-scale catastrophes may also reduce the overall level of economic activity in affected countries, which could hurt our business and the value of our investments or our ability to sell new policies.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our life insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality, such as a pandemic or other event that causes a large number of deaths, especially if concentrated in our top foreign markets.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	A significant pandemic could have a major impact on the global economy or the economies of particular countries or regions, including travel, trade, tourism, the health system, food supply, consumption, overall economic output and, eventually, on the financial markets.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	In addition, a pandemic that affected our employees, our policyholders, our independent consultants or other companies with which we do business could disrupt our business operations.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P50_S3	The effectiveness of external parties, including governmental and non-governmental organizations, in combating the spread and severity of such a pandemic could have a material impact on the losses experienced by us.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P50_S4	These events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the costs of customer relationships acquired, which would increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	At December 31, 2017 , we had $167.1 million of deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	DAC represents costs that vary with and are directly related to the successful sale and issuance of our insurance policies and are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	These costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions, solicitation and printing costs, sales material costs and some support costs, such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Under U.S. GAAP for our type of insurance products, DAC is amortized over the premium-paying period of the policies.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	In addition, when we acquire a block of insurance policies, we assign a portion of the purchase price to the right to receive future net cash flows from existing insurance and investment contracts and policies.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	This intangible asset, called the cost of customer relationships acquired, or CCRA, represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	At December 31, 2017 , we had $17.5 million of CCRA.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P54_S3	We amortize the value of this intangible asset in a manner similar to the amortization of DAC.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The amortization of DAC and CCRA is subject to acceleration and generally depends upon anticipated profits from investments, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, persistency and maintenance expense margins.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	For example, if our insurance policy lapse and surrender rates were to exceed the assumptions upon which we priced our insurance policies, or if actual persistency proves to be less than our persistency assumptions, especially in the early years of a policy, we might be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We regularly review the quality of our DAC and CCRA to determine if they are recoverable from future income.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	If these costs are not recoverable, the amount that is not recoverable is charged to expenses in the financial period in which we make this determination.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses, investment returns, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, lapses or persistency may cause us to increase the amortization of DAC or CCRA, or both, or to record a current period expense to increase benefit reserves, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We may be required to recognize an impairment on the value of our goodwill, which would increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the amount paid by us to acquire various life insurance companies over the fair value of their net assets at the date of the acquisition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Goodwill is impaired if its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P60_S1	This may occur for various reasons, including changes in actual or expected earnings or cash flows of a reporting unit, generation of earnings by a reporting unit at a lower rate than similar businesses or declines in market prices for publicly traded businesses similar to our reporting units.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P60_S2	If any portion of our goodwill becomes impaired, we would be required to recognize the amount of the impairment as a current-period expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P60_S3	In 2017, we recognized a goodwill impairment of $4.6 million on our Home Service Segment.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P60_S4	Goodwill in our consolidated financial statements was $12.6 million as of December 31, 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Management s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations based on assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our conversion to a new actuarial valuation system is not yet complete and contains known uncertainties that could result in identification of additional errors in our financial reporting.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The Company is in the process of converting its actuarial valuation from a third party service provider to an actuarial valuation modeling software system purchased from a vendor.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	In connection with our ongoing actuarial valuation conversion, certain legacy system immaterial errors were discovered in both 2017 and 2016.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	As we complete this validation and conversion, we could identify additional differences that will be evaluated for financial reporting purposes.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P64_S2	The conversion to the new system is expected to be completed in 2018.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We are a defendant in lawsuits, which may adversely affect our financial condition and detract from the time our management is able to devote to our business, and we are subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory matters.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	From time to time we are, and have been, subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions and investigations relating to our business operations, including, but not limited to:
24090_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	disputes relating to businesses acquired and operated by us.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	In the absence of countervailing considerations, we would expect to defend any such claims vigorously.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P68_S1	However, in doing so, we could incur significant defense costs, including attorneys' fees, other direct litigation costs and the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Further, if we suffer an adverse judgment as a result of any claim, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	As noted above, and as disclosed in prior periods, the legal and regulatory actions facing the Company include those relating to compliance with U.S. federal securities laws.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Specifically, the Company has been the subject of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), which appears to be focused on the Company s internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures in light of the Company s determination in 2015 that a portion of the life insurance and annuity policies issued by its subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702 and 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P69_S2	There have been no allegations of fraud presented by the SEC.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P69_S3	We have cooperated fully with the investigation and expect that the matter will be resolved soon, although we cannot predict the timing of a resolution or the ultimate outcome of the investigation.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Reinsurers with which we do business could increase their premium rates and may not honor their obligations, leaving us liable for the reinsured coverage.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We reinsure certain risks underwritten by our various insurance subsidiaries.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P71_S2	The high cost of reinsurance or lack of affordable coverage could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P72_S1	We may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities and, even if highly desirable or necessary, we may not be able to obtain replacement reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts or at rates economic to us.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P72_S2	If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling or unable to bear an increase in net exposures, we may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P72_S3	In addition, our reinsurance facilities may be canceled for new business, pursuant to their terms, upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including a change of control of our Company (generally defined as the acquisition of 10% or more of our voting equity securities) or the failure of our insurance company subsidiaries to maintain the minimum required levels of statutory surplus.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P72_S4	Any of these potential developments could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	In 2017 , we reinsured $503.7 million of the face amount of our life insurance policies.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Amounts reinsured in 2017 represented 10.1% of the face amount of direct life insurance in force in that year.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Although the cost of reinsurance is, in some cases, reflected in premium rates, under certain reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer may increase the rate it charges us for reinsurance.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P74_S1	If our cost of reinsurance were to increase, we might not be able to recover these increased costs, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P74_S2	See Note 5 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our international markets face significant competition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P75_S1	If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, our business, results of operations and profitability may be adversely affected.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Our international marketing plan focuses on making available U.S. dollar-denominated life insurance products to individuals residing in more than 30 countries.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P76_S1	New competition could increase the supply of available insurance, which could adversely affect our ability to price our products at attractive profitable rates and thereby adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Existing barriers to entry in the foreign markets we serve may not be sufficient to impede potential competitors from entering such markets.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P76_S3	In connection with our business with foreign nationals, we experience competition primarily from the following sources, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have:
24090_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Foreign operated companies with U.S. dollar-denominated policies.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We face direct competition from companies that operate in the same manner as we operate in our international markets.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Another group of our competitors in the international marketplace consists of foreign operated companies that have locally operated subsidiaries that offer both local jurisdiction regulated products in local currency and off-shore U.S. dollar-denominated policies.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P79_S1	This arrangement creates competition in that the U.S. dollar-denominated policies are offered in conjunction with high-need local insurance policies such as health insurance.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Local currency policies provide the benefit of assets located in the country of foreign residents, but entail risks of uncertainty due to local currency fluctuations, as well as the perceived instability and weakness of local currencies.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Locally operated companies with local currency policies.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P81_S1	We compete with companies formed and operated in the country in which our foreign insureds reside.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Generally, these companies are subject to risks of currency fluctuations, and they primarily use mortality tables based on experience of the local population as a whole.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P81_S3	These mortality tables are typically based on significantly shorter life spans than those we use.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P81_S4	As a result, the cost of insurance from these companies tends to be higher than ours.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P81_S5	Although these companies typically market their policies to a broader section of the population than do our independent marketing firms and independent consultants, there can be no assurance that these companies will not endeavor to place a greater emphasis on our target market and compete more directly with us.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P82_S0	In addition, from time to time, companies enter and exit the markets in which we operate, thereby increasing competition at times when there are new entrants.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P82_S1	We may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices, or for other reasons.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P83_S0	There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in any of our markets.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P83_S1	If we do not, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Sales of our insurance products could decline if we are unable to (i) establish and maintain commercial relationships with independent marketing firms and independent consultants, (ii) attract and retain employee agents or (iii) develop and maintain our distribution sources.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We distribute our insurance products through several distribution channels, including independent marketing firms, independent consultants and our employee agents.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P85_S1	These relationships are significant for both our revenues and our profits.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P85_S2	In our life insurance segment, we depend almost exclusively on the services of independent marketing firms and independent consultants.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P85_S3	In our home service insurance segment, we depend on employee agents whose role in our distribution process is integral to developing and maintaining relationships with policyholders.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Significant competition exists among insurers in attracting and maintaining marketers of demonstrated ability.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Some of our competitors may offer better compensation packages for marketing firms, independent consultants and agents and broader arrays of products and have a greater diversity of distribution resources, better brand recognition, more competitive pricing, lower cost structures and greater financial strength or claims paying ratings than we do.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P86_S2	We compete with other insurers for marketing firms, independent consultants and employee agents primarily on the basis of our compensation and support services.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P86_S3	Any reduction in our ability to attract and retain effective sales representatives could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P87_S0	There may be adverse tax, legal or financial consequences if our sales representatives are determined not to be independent contractors.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Our international sales representatives are independent contractors who operate their own businesses.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Although we believe that we have properly classified our representatives as independent contractors, there is nevertheless a risk that the IRS, a foreign agency, a court or other authority will take the different view that our sales representatives should be treated like employees.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P88_S2	Furthermore, the tests governing the determination of whether an individual is considered to be an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact-sensitive and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification of independent sales representatives are subject to change or interpretation.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P89_S1	If there is a change in the manner in which our independent contractors are classified or an adverse determination with respect to some or all of our independent contractors by a court or governmental agency, we could incur significant costs in complying with such laws and regulations, including in respect of tax withholding, social security payments, government and private pension plan contributions and recordkeeping, or we may be required to modify our business model, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P89_S2	In addition, there is the risk that we may be subject to significant monetary liabilities arising from fines or judgments as a result of any such actual or alleged non-compliance with applicable federal, state, local or foreign laws.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P90_S0	We are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the United States, which is subject to change and may increase our costs of doing business, restrict the conduct of our business and negatively impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in U.S. jurisdictions where we do business, including state insurance regulations and U.S. federal securities, tax, financial services, privacy, anti-money laundering, bank secrecy, anti-corruption and foreign asset control laws.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Insurance company regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, with substantially lesser protections to shareholders of the regulated insurance companies.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P92_S1	To that end, all the states in which we do business have insurance regulatory agencies with broad legal powers with respect to licensing companies to transact business; mandating capital and surplus requirements; regulating trade and claims practices; approving policy forms; and restricting companies' ability to enter and exit markets.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P93_S0	The capacity for an insurance company's growth in premiums is partially a function of its required statutory surplus.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus, as measured by statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by a company's state of domicile, is considered important by all state insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P93_S2	Failure to maintain required levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action by regulatory authorities.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Most insurance regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant, renew, suspend and revoke licenses and approvals, and could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities, including acquisitions of other insurance companies, require us to add capital to our insurance company subsidiaries, or fine us.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P95_S0	regulations and their interpretations, including the USA Patriot Act, our revenues, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Our failure to maintain effective information systems could adversely affect our business.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P97_S0	We must maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop new information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P97_S1	If we do not maintain adequate systems, we could experience adverse consequences, including products acquired through acquisition, inadequate information on which to base pricing, underwriting and reserve decisions, regulatory problems, failure to meet prompt payment obligations, increases in administrative expenses and loss of customers.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Some of our information technology systems and software are mainframe-based, legacy-type systems that require an ongoing commitment of resources to maintain current standards.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Our systems utilize proprietary code requiring highly skilled personnel.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Due to the unique nature of our proprietary operating environment, we could have difficulty finding personnel with the skills required to provide ongoing system maintenance and development as we seek to keep pace with changes in our products and business models, information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and policyholder needs.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P98_S3	Our success is dependent upon, among other things, maintaining and enhancing the effectiveness of existing systems, as well as continuing to integrate, develop and enhance our information systems to support business processes in a cost-effective manner.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Failures of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, impair our ability to timely file reports with the SEC and subject us to litigation and/or regulatory scrutiny and penalties.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P101_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that we timely report information as specified in SEC rules and regulations.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P101_S1	We also maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P101_S2	However, these controls may not achieve, and in some cases have not achieved, their intended objectives.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P101_S3	Control processes that involve human diligence and oversight, such as our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, are subject to human error.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P101_S4	Controls that rely on models may be subject to inadequate design or inaccurate assumptions or estimates.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P101_S5	Controls also can be circumvented by improper management override of such controls.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P101_S6	Because of such limitations, there are risks that material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected, and that information may not be reported on a timely basis.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P101_S7	The failure of our controls to be effective could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the market for our common stock, and could subject us to litigation, regulatory scrutiny and/or penalties.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P102_S0	As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have identified control deficiencies in our disclosure controls and financial reporting process that constitute material weaknesses and for which remediation is still in process as of December 31, 2017.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P102_S1	If we fail to design effective controls, fail to remediate control deficiencies or fail to otherwise maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future, such failures could result in a material misstatement of our annual or quarterly financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and which could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements, have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock, limit our ability to obtain financing if needed or increase the cost of any financing we may obtain.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P102_S2	In addition, these failures may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, impair our ability to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, subject us to litigation and regulatory scrutiny and cause us to incur substantial additional costs in future periods relating to the implementation of remedial measures.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Our failure to protect confidential information and privacy could result in the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential corporate or customer information, damage to our reputation, loss of customers, fines, penalties and adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to privacy regulations.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P104_S1	The actions we take to protect confidential information include among other things: monitoring our record retention plans and policies and any changes in state or federal privacy and compliance requirements; maintaining secure storage facilities for tangible records; and limiting access to electronic information in order to safeguard certain information.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P105_S0	We have a written information security program with appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect such confidential information.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P105_S1	Cyber security attacks are on the rise throughout the world and while we believe we have taken reasonable steps to secure our customer information we could experience a breach of data.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P105_S2	We closely monitor cyber attack attempts on our system, and we are not aware of any material breach of our cybersecurity, administrative, technical and physical safeguards or client data.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P105_S3	Nevertheless, it is possible a cyber attack could go undetected and that preventative actions we take to reduce this risk of cyber-incidents and protect our information may be insufficient to prevent cyber attacks or other security breaches.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P106_S0	If we do not comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information, we could experience adverse consequences, including regulatory sanctions, loss of reputation, litigation exposure, disruptions to our operations or significant technical, legal and operating expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by applicable laws and regulations in the amounts of fees, dividends and other distributions they may make to us.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P107_S1	The inability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us in sufficient amounts for us to conduct our operations could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations or expand our business.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P108_S0	As a holding company, our principal asset is the stock of our subsidiaries.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P108_S1	We rely primarily on statutorily permissible payments from our insurance company subsidiaries, principally through service agreements we have with our subsidiaries, to meet our working capital and other corporate expenses.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P108_S2	The ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to make payments to us is subject to regulation by the states in which they are domiciled, and these payments depend primarily on approved service agreements between us and these subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, the statutory surplus (which is the excess of assets over liabilities as determined under statutory accounting practices prescribed by an insurance company's state of domicile), future statutory earnings (which are earnings as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices) and regulatory restrictions.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Generally, the net assets of our insurance company subsidiaries available for dividends are limited to either the lesser or greater (depending on the state of domicile) of the subsidiary's net gain from operations during the preceding year and 10% of the subsidiary's net statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Except to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of our subsidiaries' creditors, including policyholders, have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors and shareholders.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P110_S1	If any of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates or otherwise reorganizes, our creditors and shareholders will have no right to proceed in their own right against the assets of that subsidiary or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of the subsidiary under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Unexpected losses in future reporting periods may require us to adjust the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P112_S0	We evaluate our deferred tax asset ( DTA ) quarterly for recoverability based on available evidence.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P112_S1	This process involves management's judgment about assumptions, which are subject to change from period to period due to tax rate changes or variances between our projected operating performance and our actual results.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P112_S2	Ultimately, future adjustments to the DTA valuation allowance, if any, will be determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P113_S0	The realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry back or carry forward periods under applicable tax law.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P114_S0	Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we may be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P114_S1	Such an adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and capital position.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P115_S0	We face a greater risk of money laundering activity associated with sales derived from residents of certain foreign countries.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P116_S0	Some of our top international markets are in countries identified by the U.S. Department of State as jurisdictions of high risk for money laundering.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P117_S0	As required by Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA ) regulations applicable to insurance companies, we have developed and implemented an anti-money laundering program that includes policies and procedures for complying with our applicable BSA program, auditing, reporting and recordkeeping requirements and for deterring, preventing and detecting potential money laundering, fraud and other criminal activity ( BSA Program ).
24090_18_ITEM1A_P117_S1	We have an enhanced BSA Program with additional controls, such as list screening software beyond sanctions screening required by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ( OFAC ), enhanced payment due diligence and transaction controls.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P117_S2	However, there can be no assurance that these enhanced controls will entirely mitigate money laundering risk associated with these jurisdictions.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P118_S0	If our foreign policyholders reduced or ceased participation in our Stock Investment Plan (the Plan ) or if a securities regulatory authority were to deem the CISIP's operation contrary to securities laws, the volume of Class A common stock purchased on the open market through the CISIP, and the price of our Class A common stock, could fall.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P119_S0	More than 96% of the shares of Class A common stock purchased under the CISIP in 2017 were purchased by foreign holders of life insurance policies (or related brokers); the remaining 4% of the shares of Class A common stock purchased under the CISIP in 2017 were purchased by approximately 1,864 participants resident in the United States.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P120_S0	The CISIP is registered with the SEC pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, but is not registered under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P120_S1	If a foreign securities regulatory authority were to determine the offer and sale of our Class A common stock under the CISIP were contrary to applicable laws and regulations of its jurisdiction, such authority may issue or assert a fine, penalty or cease and desist order against us in that foreign jurisdiction.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P120_S2	There is a risk our Class A common stock price could be negatively impacted by a decrease in participation in the CISIP.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P120_S3	If fewer policyholders elect to participate in the Plan, or our international premium collections were to decrease as a result of regulatory, economic, or marketing impediments, the trading volume of our Class A common stock may decline from its present levels, the demand for our Class A common stock could be negatively impacted and the price of our Class A common stock could fall.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P121_S0	Control of our Company, through the ownership of our Class B Common Stock, has transferred from our founder to a 501(c)(3) charitable foundation established by our founder, and we cannot determine whether any change in our management, operations, or operating strategies will occur as a result of this ownership change.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P122_S0	Harold E. Riley, our founder, was the beneficial owner of 100% of our Class B common stock, which was held in the name of the Harold E. Riley Trust ("Trust"), of which he had served as Trustee until his death in September 2017.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P122_S1	Our Class A and Class B common stock are identical in all respects, except the Class B common stock elects a simple majority of the Board and receives one-half of any cash dividends paid, on a per share basis, to the Class A shares.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P122_S2	The Class A common stock elects the remainder of the Board.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P123_S0	The Trust documents provided that upon Mr. Riley's death, the Class B common stock was transferred from the Trust to the Harold E. Riley Foundation, a charitable organization established under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Foundation").
24090_18_ITEM1A_P123_S1	Therefore, the Foundation controls our Company.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P124_S0	The Foundation is organized as a public support charity for the benefit of its charitable beneficiaries, Baylor University and Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P124_S1	The Foundation is governed by 11 trustees, five of which were appointed by Harold Riley prior to his death, three of which were appointed by Baylor University and three of which were appointed by Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P124_S2	It is unclear what, if any, change will occur to our board, management, or corporate operating strategies as a result of different ownership of our Class B common stock.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P125_S0	The transfer of our Class B common stock from the Trust has triggered the first of two prongs of certain change in control provisions in the employment agreements of our top two executives Chief Executive Officer Geoff Kolander and Chief Financial Officer Kay Osbourn.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P125_S1	Under each employment agreement, a "change in control" includes, among other things (1) the transfer of a majority of the Company's Class B common stock from the Trust to an individual other than Harold E. Riley, an entity not beneficially owned by Harold E. Riley, or a trust not controlled by Harold E. Riley and (2) the exercise of a power of attorney granted by Harold E. Riley over the Company's Class B common stock.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P125_S2	Upon a termination of the executive by Citizens without cause or the executive s voluntary termination with Good Reason, in each case other than within the ninety (90) day period prior to the consummation of a change in control or within one (1) year following a change in control, the executive would be entitled to certain cash payments and benefits.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P126_S0	There are a substantial number of our shares of Class A common stock issued to our executive officers and directors which are eligible for future sale in the public market.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P126_S1	The sale of these shares could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fall.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P127_S0	There were 49,080,114 shares of our Class A common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM1A_P127_S1	Our executive officers and directors owned approximately 54,436 shares of our Class A common stock as of December 31, 2017 , representing approximately 0.1% of our then outstanding Class A common stock.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P127_S2	Almost all of these shares have been registered for public resale and generally may be sold freely.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P127_S3	In the event of a sale of some or all of these shares or the perceived sale of these shares, the market price of our Class A common stock could fall substantially.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P128_S0	The price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P129_S0	Our Class A common stock price has historically fluctuated and is likely to fluctuate in the future and could decline materially because of the volatility of the stock market in general, decreased participation in the CISIP referred to above or a variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: quarterly or annual variations in actual or anticipated results of our operations; interest rate fluctuations; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; competition and other factors affecting the life insurance business generally; and conditions in the U.S. and world economies.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P130_S0	Our international markets, and the specific manner in which we conduct our business in those jurisdictions, may be subject to negative publicity in social media or other channels, which may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P131_S0	We interface with and distribute our products to residents of foreign countries that may be subject to the risks disclosed in our Item 1A. Risk Factor under the heading, The majority of our sales derive from residents of foreign countries and are subject to risks associated with widespread political instability, currency control laws and foreign insurance laws.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P131_S1	A significant loss of sales in these foreign markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition".
24090_18_ITEM1A_P131_S2	Accordingly, from time to time, bloggers or other social media outlets relevant to investors may focus attention on our exposure to these countries and the negative circumstances surrounding their governments, thereby subjecting us to periodic negative publicity.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P131_S3	Negative publicity on investor blogs or through other media channels could impact trading in our stock especially due to aggressive and coordinated efforts between anonymous bloggers and short sellers which ultimately cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fall.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P132_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as applicable state insurance laws, may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P133_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as various state insurance laws, may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a takeover attempt our shareholders might consider in their best interests.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P133_S1	As a result, our shareholders will be prevented from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our Class A common stock that may be offered by a bidder in a takeover context.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P133_S2	Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P134_S0	The following provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws make it difficult for our Class A shareholders to replace or remove our directors and have other anti-takeover effects that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt:
24090_18_ITEM1A_P135_S0	our board of directors may issue one or more series of preferred stock without the approval of our shareholders.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P136_S0	State insurance laws generally require prior approval of a change in control of an insurance company.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P136_S1	Generally, such laws provide that control over an insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the insurer.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P137_S0	In considering an application to acquire control of an insurer, an insurance commissioner generally will consider such factors as the experience, competence and financial strength of the proposed acquirer, the integrity of the proposed acquirer's board of directors and executive officers, the proposed acquirer's plans for the management and operation of the insurer, and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the acquisition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P137_S1	In addition, a person seeking to acquire control of an insurance company is required in some states to make filings prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and the target insurance company and their affiliates have sufficiently large market shares in particular lines of insurance in those states.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P137_S2	These state insurance requirements may delay, deter or prevent our ability to complete an acquisition.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P138_S0	We have never paid any cash dividends on our Class A common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P139_S0	We have never paid cash dividends on our Class A common stock, as it is our policy to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business.
24090_18_ITEM1A_P139_S1	We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
24090_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease our principal office in Austin, Texas to service all business entities and operations.
24090_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	We also own properties in Austin and Buchanan Dam, Texas used for our general business operations and Louisiana related to our Home Service segment and business operations.
24090_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	On or about March 16, 2017, Juan Gamboa filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and five of its current and former directors and executive officers in the United States District Court, Western District of Texas.
24090_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	The lawsuit alleges the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by making false and/or misleading statements, as well as failing to disclose material adverse facts about the Company s business, operations and prospects.
24090_18_ITEM3_P0_S2	On May 25, 2017, the court appointed lead plaintiffs, and on July 31, 2017, the lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.
24090_18_ITEM3_P0_S3	The amended complaint seeks an award of damages in an unspecified amount on behalf of a putative class consisting of persons who purchased the Company s common stock between March 11, 2015 and March 8, 2017, inclusive.
24090_18_ITEM3_P0_S4	On September 28, 2017, we filed a motion to dismiss, which remains pending before the court.
24090_18_ITEM3_P0_S5	The Company believes that the lawsuit is without merit, and it intends to vigorously defend against all claims asserted.
24090_18_ITEM3_P0_S6	At this time, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the outcome of this litigation.
24090_18_ITEM3_P1_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various legal and regulatory actions which are immaterial to the Company's financial statements.
24090_18_ITEM3_P1_S1	For more information about the risks related to litigation and regulatory actions, please see the risk factor titled We are a defendant in lawsuits, which may adversely affect our financial condition and detract from the time our management is able to devote to our business, and we are subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory matters.
24090_18_ITEM3_P2_S0	As disclosed in prior periods, the legal and regulatory actions facing the Company include those relating to compliance with U.S. federal securities laws.
24090_18_ITEM3_P2_S1	Specifically, the Company has been the subject of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), which appears to be focused on the Company s internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures in light of the Company s determination in 2015 that a portion of the life insurance and annuity policies issued by its subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702 and 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
24090_18_ITEM3_P2_S2	There have been no allegations of fraud presented by the SEC.
24090_18_ITEM3_P2_S3	We have cooperated fully with the investigation and expect that the matter will be resolved soon, although we cannot predict the timing of a resolution or the ultimate outcome of the investigation.
24090_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol CIA.
24090_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	Quarterly high and low closing prices per share of our Class A common stock as reported by the NYSE are shown below.
24090_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	The number of stockholders on record on March 5, 2018 was as follows:
24090_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	We have never paid cash dividends on our Class A or B common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
24090_18_ITEM5_P3_S1	For restrictions on our present and future ability to pay dividends, see Note 6 of the Company's consolidated financial statements.
24090_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	We did not purchase any of our equity securities during any quarter in 2015 , 2016 or 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM5_P5_S0	The following table sets forth information regarding securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plan, the Citizens Inc.

24090_18_ITEM5_P7_S1	The companies included in the peer group index are shown in the following table.
24090_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table presents selected financial data of the Company.
24090_18_ITEM6_P0_S1	This should be read in conjunction with Item 7.

24090_18_ITEM6_P1_S0	"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," for information that may affect the comparability of the financial data contained in the above table.
24090_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following is management's discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations of the Company.
24090_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	It is intended to be a discussion of certain key financial information regarding the Company and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related Notes to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
24090_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	We conduct operations as an insurance holding company emphasizing ordinary life insurance and endowment products in niche markets where we believe we can achieve competitive advantages.
24090_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	As an insurance provider, we collect premiums on an ongoing basis to pay future benefits to our policy and contract holders.
24090_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company derives its revenues principally from 1) premiums earned for insurance coverages provided to insureds; 2) net investment income; and 3) net realized capital gains and losses.
24090_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Profitability of our insurance operations depends heavily upon the Company s underwriting discipline, as we seek to manage exposure to loss through:
24090_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	management of our expense ratio, which we accomplish through economies of scale and management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses.
24090_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future losses based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the Company s response to competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels.
24090_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company seeks to price our insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin.
24090_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	The Company has the ability to adjust dividend scales and interest crediting rates at its discretion based on economic and other factors.
24090_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	The profitability of fixed annuities, riders and other spread-based product features depends largely on the Company s ability to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on assets and interest credited to policyholders.
24090_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	The investment return, or yield, on invested assets is an important element of the Company s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before benefits are paid.
24090_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	The majority of the Company s invested assets have been held in fixed maturities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, primarily in asset classes of corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and government obligation bonds.
24090_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	The interest rate environment has a significant impact on the determination of insurance contract liabilities, our investment rates and yields and our asset/liability management.
24090_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	The primary investment objective for the Company is to maximize economic value, consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including the management of credit risk and interest rate sensitivity of invested assets, while generating sufficient after-tax income to meet policyholder and corporate obligations.
24090_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Company maintains a conservative investment strategy that may vary based on a variety of factors including business needs, regulatory requirements and tax considerations.
24090_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	We previously announced that we determined that a portion of the life and annuity insurance policies issued by our subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702 and 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") of 1986.
24090_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	to the IRS for failure to withhold taxes or to notify policyholders of their obligation to pay taxes directly to the IRS.
24090_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	We have undertaken an analysis of our potential liability to the IRS arising from this matter, as well as other expenses we may incur to remediate (i.e., conform to the requirements of the IRS) certain previously issued domestic life insurance and annuity policies and to address any missed reporting for policies issued to non-U.S. citizens and have established a best estimate reserve of $ 12.3 million, net of tax as of December 31, 2017 for probable liabilities and expenses.
24090_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	The probability weighted range of financial estimates relative to this issue is $5.9 million to $48.2 million , net of tax.
24090_18_ITEM7_P11_S3	This estimated range includes projected toll charges and fees payable to the IRS, as well as estimated increased payout obligations to current and former holders of non-compliant domestic life insurance policies expected to result from remediation of those policies.
24090_18_ITEM7_P11_S4	The amount of our liabilities and expenses depends on a number of uncertainties, including the number of prior tax years for which we may be liable to the IRS, the number of domestic life insurance policies we will be required to remediate, the methodology applicable to the calculation of taxable benefits under non-compliant policies and the amount of time and resources we will require from external advisors who are assisting us with resolving these issues.
24090_18_ITEM7_P11_S5	Given the range of potential outcomes and the significant variables assumed in establishing our estimates, actual amounts incurred may exceed our reserve and also could exceed the high end of our estimated range of liabilities and expenses.
24090_18_ITEM7_P11_S6	To the extent the amount reserved is insufficient to meet the actual amount of our liabilities and expenses, or if our estimates of those liabilities and expenses change in the future, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
24090_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	In May 2017, we submitted an offer to enter into closing agreements with the IRS covering the CICA and CNLIC domestic life insurance business.
24090_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	The toll charges calculated and enumerated in the closing agreements totaled $124,000 and $4,000 for the CICA and CNLIC domestic life insurance businesses, respectively.
24090_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	We expect to file closing agreements with the IRS for the SPLIC and MGLIC life insurance business as well as for the CICA international business and our annuity business in 2018.
24090_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our 2017 financial results are driven by our historical business management model and traditional life insurance product sales.
24090_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	Although interest rates have risen recently, the historically low interest rate environment continues to impact our results and our industry as investment yields are an integral component of our business operations.
24090_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Realized net investment gains in the current year resulted from a gain on the sale of a real estate holding totaling $1.1 million offset by other-than-temporary impairments ("OTTI") on investment securities.
24090_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	OTTI items recorded totaled $0.2 million and $4.3 million in 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and are reported as realized losses.
24090_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	The OTTI in 2016 was somewhat offset by realized investment gains on sales of fixed maturity securities in our available-for-sale portfolio and sales of equity securities.
24090_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	During 2017 , claims and surrenders expense increased 1.9% from the comparable period in 2016 , primarily due to an increase in surrender benefits and matured endowments in the life segment compared to the 2016 levels.
24090_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	In addition, we impaired our Home Service goodwill value by $4.6 million, down to zero.
24090_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	For over thirty-seven years, CICA and its predecessors have accepted policy applications from foreign nationals for U.S. dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies.
24090_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	We make our insurance products available using third-party marketing organizations and independent marketing consultants.
24090_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Endowment product sales have been the primary driver of sales in this segment.
24090_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	The Company currently offers a fifteen and twenty year endowment and our top selling endowment is a product that matures at age sixty-five.
24090_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	The Company repriced its top six selling international products at the end of 2016 to increase profitability.
24090_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Through the domestic market of our Life Insurance segment, we provide ordinary whole life, credit life insurance, and final expense policies to middle and lower income families and individuals in certain markets in the mountain west, midwest and southern U.S.
24090_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	The majority of our domestic revenues are generated by the policies of domestic life insurance companies we have acquired since 1987.
24090_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	We provide final expense ordinary and industrial life insurance to middle and lower income individuals in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	Our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through a home service marketing distribution system utilizing employee-agents who work on a route system to collect premiums and service policyholders, and through networks of funeral homes that collect premiums and provide personal policyholder service.
24090_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Premiums in this segment increased slightly in 2017 compared to 2016 , as renewal premiums and first year premiums increased.
24090_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	We noted slight increases in 2016 compared to 2015 which were driven by renewal premiums.
24090_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Significant economic issues impacting our business and industry currently and into the future are discussed below.
24090_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Slow increases in the interest rate environment will limit increases in profit margins for insurers.
24090_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	We have been impacted by the historically low interest rate environment over the past several years as our fixed income investment portfolio, primarily invested in callable securities, has been reinvested at lower yields.
24090_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	The Company s conservative investment strategy has not changed but we have focused new investments into securities of state, municipalities, essential services and corporate issuers compared to our historical investment in U.S. government holdings.
24090_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	Our investment earnings also impact the reserve and DAC balances, as assumptions are used in the development of the balances.
24090_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Due to the recent decline in investment yields on our portfolio, our projection of long-term investment returns has declined.
24090_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	This has resulted in increasing the reserves on policies issued in the current year, as well as reducing the DAC asset.
24090_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	As an increasing percentage of the world population reaches retirement age, we believe we will benefit from increased demand for living benefit products rather than death benefit products, as customers will require cash accumulation to pay expenses to meet their lifetime income needs.
24090_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	Our ordinary life products are designed to accumulate cash values to provide for living expenses in a policy owner's later years, while continuously providing a death benefit.
24090_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	There has been a trend toward consolidation of domestic life insurance companies, due to significant losses incurred by the life insurance industry as a result of the credit crisis and related economic pressures, as well as increasing costs of regulatory compliance for domestic life insurance companies.
24090_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Many of the events and trends affecting the life insurance industry have had an impact on the life reinsurance industry.
24090_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	These events have led to a decline in the availability of reinsurance.
24090_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	While we currently cede a limited amount of our primary insurance business to reinsurers, we may find it difficult to obtain reinsurance in the future, forcing us to seek reinsurers who are more expensive to us.
24090_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	If we cannot obtain affordable reinsurance coverage, either our net exposures will increase or we will have to reduce our underwriting commitments.
24090_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Innovation and digital development strategies will be implemented in various industries including the insurance industry in the coming years which could significantly impact our business.
24090_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	It will be critical that we embrace these changes to the benefit of our policyholders, agents and stockholders.
24090_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	While our management has extensive experience in writing life insurance policies for foreign residents, changes to foreign laws and regulations and their related application and enforcement, along with currency controls affecting our foreign resident insureds could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	A discussion of consolidated results is presented below, followed by a discussion of segment operations and financial results by segment.
24090_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Insurance revenues are primarily generated from premium revenues and investment income.
24090_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	In addition, realized gains and losses on investment holdings can significantly impact revenues from year to year.
24090_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Premium income derived from life, accident and health, and property insurance sales remained relatively flat during 2017 compared to 2016 , and increased 1.7% during 2016 compared to 2015 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	Life insurance reflected an increase resulting primarily from renewal premiums, which increased 2.2% in 2017 and 2.4% in 2016 and totaled $171.9 million , $168.3 million and $164.4 million on the consolidated level in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
24090_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	New sales, reflected as first year premiums, decreased 18.8% and 0.5% , and 2.7% in the life segment in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
24090_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	In 2017, to increase productivity, we introduced a set of repriced products in our international markets that are more expensive policies for our customers and likely negatively impacted our new sales.
24090_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	In addition, Venezuela, which has historically been one of our top markets, has experienced economic and social turmoil, which has negatively impacted our sales in the country, decreasing 10% year over year based upon total premiums from 2016 to 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Endowment sales represent a significant portion of new business sales internationally with the 20-year endowment and endowment to age 65 as our top products.
24090_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	In addition, most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision, which allows the policyholder to use cash value within a policy to pay premiums.
24090_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	The policy loan asset balance increased 10.6% and 10.8% in 2017 and 2016 , year over year and remains in line with historical levels when compared to policy benefit liabilities.
24090_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Net investment income increased to $53.1 million in 2017 compared to $48.6 million in 2016 , as we experienced higher average invested assets as a result of our investment of incoming premium revenue.
24090_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	Our yield on average invested assets increased three basis points from 2016 to 2017 as rates stayed similar on investments.
24090_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	Net investment income performance is summarized as follows.
24090_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	We have traditionally invested in fixed maturity securities with a large percentage held in callable issues.
24090_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	The sustained low interest rate environment of the past several years is holding down yields.
24090_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	While U.S. Treasury interest rates have risen recently after a fairly significant decline during 2016, yields on high quality corporate and municipal securities have been slower to rise.
24090_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	The interest rate direction is uncertain but as market interest rates begin to rise, our call risk will diminish, resulting in our fixed securities maturing at the stated maturity dates and our portfolio yield will rise more slowly over time, as new money investments would be made at higher rates.
24090_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Investment income from fixed maturity securities accounted for approximately 88.0% of total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	We have increased our investment purchases of corporate and municipal securities over the past several years, with no focus on any particular industry sectors in these security categories, but rather a focus on higher yielding, investment quality securities.
24090_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	In addition, we currently have $15.6 million invested in equity securities related to bond and stock mutual funds as these securities offer a competitive yield with a shorter duration.
24090_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	However, we have reduced our holdings over the last several years due to higher earnings volatility and RBC charges.
24090_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Investment income from fixed maturity investments increased in 2017 due to an increase in the portfolio from new money investment purchases as noted above relative to the fixed maturity portfolio.
24090_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	In addition, the increase in the policy loans asset balance, which represents policyholders utilizing their accumulated policy cash value, contributed to the increase to investment income.
24090_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Investment income from equity securities has declined as we have reduced our holdings as discussed above.
24090_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	Net realized gains in 2017 resulted primarily from a gain of $1.1 million recognized on the sale of a real estate holding reduced by impairments.
24090_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	Net realized investment losses recorded from OTTI on both fixed maturity and equity securities totaling $0.2 million and $4.3 million , in 2017 and 2016 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	The OTTI in 2016 was somewhat offset by realized investment gains on sales of fixed maturity securities in our available-for-sale portfolio and sales of equity securities.
24090_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	Realized investment gains (losses) are as follows.
24090_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	As noted in the table below, claims, benefits and surrenders increased from $81.4 million in 2016 to $82.9 million in 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	The Company monitors death claims based upon expectations.
24090_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	These values may routinely fluctuate from year to year.
24090_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	Policy surrenders increased 10.4% in 2017 from 2016 and 6.3% from 2015 to 2016 , or 0.8% and 0.7% of direct ordinary whole life insurance in force for 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
24090_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	The increase in surrender expense is primarily related to our international business and is expected to increase over time due to the aging of this block of business.
24090_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	Our premium persistency rates have remained consistent for 2017 and 2016 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	A significant portion of surrenders relates to policies that have been in force over fifteen years and no longer have a surrender charge associated with them.
24090_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	Total direct insurance in force reported in 2017 was $5.0 billion and was consistent with 2016 and 2015 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	Endowment benefits decreased slightly in 2017 compared to 2016 amounts.
24090_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	We have a series of international policies that carry an immediate endowment benefit of an amount selected by the policy owner.
24090_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	These benefits have been popular in the Pacific Rim and Latin America, where the Company has experienced increased interest in our guaranteed products in recent years.
24090_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	Annual guaranteed endowments are factored into the premium, and, as such, the increase or decrease is expected to have little impact on expected profitability.
24090_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Matured endowments decreased in the current year after increasing in 2016 and 2015 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	We expect this increasing trend to continue as this block of business increases, persists and policies begin to reach maturity.
24090_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	Property claims decreased 10% to approximately $1.7 million in 2017 compared with the amount reported for 2016 due to a decrease in weather-related claims.
24090_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Other policy benefits resulted primarily from interest paid on premium deposits and policy benefit accumulations and increased as these policy liabilities also increased.
24090_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	Increase in Future Policy Benefit Reserves .
24090_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	The change in future policy benefit reserves has increased in 2017 by 0.2% and decrease in 2016 by 1.5% .
24090_18_ITEM7_P54_S2	The 2016 decrease was mainly due to higher surrender activity recorded when compared to the prior year.
24090_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	The Company issues long duration participating policies in our life segment to foreign residents that are expected to pay dividends to policyholders based upon actual experience.
24090_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	Initially, policyholder dividend scales are factored into the guaranteed premiums at the time the product is developed, based on expected future experience and desired profit goals.
24090_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	As actual and expected experience develops over time, it can become necessary to adjust dividends, as we did at the end of 2016 , in order to maintain our original expected level of long term product profitability.
24090_18_ITEM7_P55_S3	Policyholders' dividends decreased 8.3% in 2017 compared to 2016 , and 36.4% in 2016 compared to 2015 or $0.6 million and $3.9 million, respectively, due to the dividend rate actions that we took at the end of 2016 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	Commission expense fluctuates in a direct relationship to new and renewal insurance premiums and has decreased 7.4% in 2017 compared to 2016 as first year premium revenues, on which higher commission rates are paid, declined in the life segment while renewal premiums were up 2.7% .
24090_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	Total general expenses increased 39.1% on a consolidated basis in 2017 due primarily to increased legal, consulting and audit fees, as well as higher salaries, bonuses and related employee benefits paid to top executives.
24090_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	We also have $4.6 million of expense in the current year due to the write-off of our home service goodwill.
24090_18_ITEM7_P57_S2	Total general expenses increased 0.2% on a consolidated basis in 2016 due primarily to the tax compliance issue we recognized in 2014.
24090_18_ITEM7_P57_S3	In 2015, we recorded an additional $3.4 million of expense related to this tax compliance issue.
24090_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	We perform an expense study on an annual basis, utilizing an enterprise-wide time study, and we adjust cost allocations among entities as needed based upon this review.
24090_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	Any allocation changes are reflected in the segment operations, but do not impact total expenses.
24090_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	Capitalized DAC were $29.1 million , $32.7 million and $31.1 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	These costs will vary based upon successful efforts related to newly issued policies and renewal business.
24090_18_ITEM7_P59_S2	Significantly lower amounts are capitalized related to renewal business in correlation with the lower commissions paid on that business compared to first year business which have higher commission rates.
24090_18_ITEM7_P59_S3	In addition, the prolonged low interest rate environment impacted the assumptions used in the development of the DAC asset for new policies issued.
24090_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	Amortization of DAC totaled $29.7 million , $28.5 million and $23.4 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 primarily due to the higher surrender activity, including early duration elections to convert existing policies to reduced paid up ("RPU") or extended term insurance ("ETI") status in 2017 and 2016 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	There are higher deferred acquisition costs associated with early duration conversions to RPU or ETI, which, when converted, increases amortization expense.
24090_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is impacted by persistency and the higher level of surrenders is impacting our amortization.
24090_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	Federal income tax expense was $35.1 million , $3.5 million and $1.2 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of (1,176.9)% , 64.1% and (61.8)% , respectively.
24090_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	The significant changes in rates noted are the result of the New Tax Act enacted at the end of 2017 and the tax compliance issue we identified in 2014 which impacted our effective tax rates in each year as these costs are not deductible for tax purposes.
24090_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	Additionally, the Company recorded a tax expense in each year for an uncertain tax position that is affecting the tax rates.
24090_18_ITEM7_P61_S3	Differences between our effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate result from income and expense items that are treated differently for financial reporting and tax purposes.
24090_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Our business is comprised of two operating business segments and Other Non-insurance Operations as detailed below.
24090_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Our insurance operations are the primary focus of the Company, as those segments generate the majority of our income.
24090_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	The amount of insurance, number of policies, and average face amounts of policies issued during the periods indicated are shown below.
24090_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	These segments are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
24090_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	The Company evaluates profit and loss performance based on net income before federal income taxes.
24090_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	Our Life Insurance segment primarily issues ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies in U.S. dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents in more than 30 countries through approximately 1,244 independent marketing consultants, and domestically through over 36 independent marketing firms and consultants throughout the United States.
24090_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	Premium revenues decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 as first year premiums decreased 18.8% and 0.5% in 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
24090_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	Premium revenues increased in 2016 compared to 2015 , due primarily to higher international renewal premiums, which have experienced strong persistency as this block of insurance ages.
24090_18_ITEM7_P67_S2	In 2016 , we cut dividend rates to make our products more profitable.
24090_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	that are more expensive policies for our customers and likely negatively impacted our new sales.
24090_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	In addition, Venezuela, which has historically been one of our top markets, has experienced economic and social turmoil, which has negatively impacted our sales in the country, decreasing 10% from 2016 to 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P68_S2	Sales from Colombia, Taiwan and Ecuador represented the majority of the new business premium increases.
24090_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	Life Insurance premium breakout is detailed below.
24090_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	Endowment sales represent a significant portion of new business sales internationally.
24090_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	In addition, most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision, which allows the policyholder to use their accumulated cash value of a policy to pay premiums.
24090_18_ITEM7_P70_S2	These accumulated cash values can also be taken as a cash loan from the policy at the request of the policyholder and are secured by the policy values.
24090_18_ITEM7_P70_S3	The policy loan asset balance increased 10.6% year over year and remains at the same approximate ratio to life reserves as noted in prior years.
24090_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	Endowment sales totaled approximately $13.3 million , $16.5 million and $16.4 million , representing approximately 76.4% , 77.0% and 76.1% of total new first year premiums in 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
24090_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	The following table sets forth, by country, our direct premiums from our international life insurance business for the periods indicated.
24090_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	Our international business and premium collections could be impacted by future changes relative to laws, regulations or economic events in the countries from which we accept applications.
24090_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	We continue to report strong first year and renewal premiums in our top producing countries (other than Venezuela) as noted above; however, this business is dependent on our clients having access to U.S. dollars.
24090_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	Our international business and premium collections could be impacted by our inability to comply with current or future foreign laws or regulations applicable to the Company or our independent consultants in the countries from which we accept applications as well as by marketing or operational changes made by the Company to comply with those laws or regulations.
24090_18_ITEM7_P73_S2	Our international business may also be affected by economic or other events in foreign countries in which our policies are marketed.
24090_18_ITEM7_P73_S3	Venezuela, for example, is continuing to experience civil unrest due to local demonstrations against crime, corruption and soaring inflation.
24090_18_ITEM7_P73_S4	See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for additional information.
24090_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	The following table sets forth our direct premiums by state from our domestic business for the periods indicated.
24090_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	We discontinued sales of the majority of our domestic products in 2017 while we reevaluate our domestic life strategy and therefore the majority of the premium recorded in 2017 is related to renewal business.
24090_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	Net investment income has increased due to continued growth in average invested assets even though the annual yield has increase d 5 basis points in this segment from 2016 , as discussed in the Consolidated Results of Operations above.
24090_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	In 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , this segment recognized losses on other-than-temporary impairments totaling $13,500, $2.3 million and $3.8 million, respectively, related to bond and mutual fund holdings.
24090_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	A breakout of claims and surrender benefits is detailed below.
24090_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	Death claims expense decreased 6.0% in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased 14.0% in 2016 compared to 2015 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	No unusual trends have been noted in our claims experience.
24090_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	Mortality experience is closely monitored by the Company as a key performance indicator and these amounts were within expected levels.
24090_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	We noted increases in surrender expense over the last several years which is primarily related to our international business and is expected to increase over time due to the aging of this block of business.
24090_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	The majority of policy surrender benefits paid is attributable to our international business and historically was related to policies that have been in force over fifteen years, when surrender charges are no longer applicable.
24090_18_ITEM7_P81_S2	However, in 2017 and 2016, the increased surrender activity is also in the earlier durations (years 1-15), which still have surrender charges.
24090_18_ITEM7_P81_S3	We are seeing various reasons for individuals surrendering their policies, including the sustained slow world-wide economy, individuals simply needing their money and former independent consultants moving business to other insurance carriers.
24090_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	Endowment benefit expense results from the election by policyholders of a product feature that provides an annual benefit.
24090_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	This is a fixed benefit over the life of the contract, and this expense will increase with new sales and improved persistency.
24090_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	Matured endowments decreased in the current year after increasing in 2016 and 2015 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P83_S1	We expect this increasing trend to continue as this block of business increases, persists and policies begin to reach maturity.
24090_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	Other policy benefits resulted primarily from interest paid on premium deposits and policy benefit accumulations and increased as these policy liabilities also increased.
24090_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	Increase in Future Policy Benefit Reserves .
24090_18_ITEM7_P85_S1	Policy benefit reserves in 2017 decreased compared to the same period in 2016 , primarily as a result of the higher surrenders and the lower new sales as noted above.
24090_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	Policyholders' dividends decreased 8.1% and 36.7% or $0.5 million and $3.9 million respectively in 2017 and 2016 , due to the dividend rate actions taken by us at the end of 2016 to improve our product profitability.
24090_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	The Company issues long duration participating policies to foreign residents that are expected to pay dividends to policyholders based upon actual experience.
24090_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	The life company boards approve any dividends on an annual basis and may change the dividend rates as needed for business purposes.
24090_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	Policyholder dividends are factored into the premiums at the time the product is developed and therefore have no impact on expected profitability.
24090_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	Capitalization and Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs .
24090_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	Capitalized costs decreased, as commission-related costs have decreased in the current year compared to 2016 based upon first year and renewal sales levels.
24090_18_ITEM7_P88_S2	Amortization of DAC increased in the current year by 3.5% from 2016 as we experienced increased surrender activity in the current year, including early duration elections to convert to reduced paid up ("RPU") or extended term insurance ("ETI") in 2017 and 2016.
24090_18_ITEM7_P88_S3	There are higher deferred acquisition costs associated with early duration conversions to RPU or ETI, which, when converted, increases amortization expense.
24090_18_ITEM7_P88_S4	Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is impacted by persistency and the higher level of surrenders is impacting our amortization.
24090_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	Commission expense increases or decreases are directly related to increases or decreases in premiums.
24090_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	First year policy premiums pay a higher commission rate than renewal policy premiums.
24090_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	Expenses increased in the current year 30.2% to $18.6 million in 2017 compared to $14.3 million in 2016 , due primarily to increased legal, consulting and audit fees, as well as higher salaries, bonuses and related employee benefits paid to top executives.
24090_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	The expenses are allocated by segment, based upon an annual expense study performed by the Company.
24090_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	Our Home Service Insurance segment provides pre-need and final expense ordinary life insurance and annuities to middle and lower income individuals primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.
24090_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	Our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through funeral homes and a home service marketing distribution system utilizing over 650 employees and independent agents.
24090_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	The premiums in this segment increased in 2017 compared to 2016 , as renewal premiums and first year premiums increased.
24090_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	There was no real growth in new business in 2016 compared to 2015 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	The following table sets forth our direct premiums by state for the periods indicated.
24090_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	Net investment income decreased in 2017 as our average invested assets decreased as did the overall portfolio yield by 13 basis points from 2016 as higher yielding securities matured and lower rate securities are purchased in the current interest rate environment.
24090_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	Net investment income for our home service insurance segment is summarized as follows:
24090_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	Realized Investment Gains (Losses), Net .
24090_18_ITEM7_P96_S1	A gain of $1.1 million was recognized on the sale of real estate property in the current year.
24090_18_ITEM7_P96_S2	In 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , this segment recognized losses on other-than-temporary impairments totaling $0.2 million, $2.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively, related to bond and mutual fund holdings.
24090_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	A breakout of claims and surrender benefits is detailed below.
24090_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	Death claims expense was relatively flat in 2017 compared to 2016 , after decreasing in 2016 from 2015 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P98_S1	Death claims can fluctuate from year to year.
24090_18_ITEM7_P98_S2	Mortality experience is closely monitored by the Company as a key performance indicator and these amounts were within expected levels.
24090_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	Surrender expenses are consistent with actuarial expectations.
24090_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	Property claims decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 related to reported weather claims.
24090_18_ITEM7_P100_S1	The large increase in 2016 was primarily due to tornado activity in Louisiana earlier in the year and high winds that accompanied the severe flooding in Louisiana.
24090_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	Increase in Future Policy Benefit Reserves .
24090_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	The change in reserves increase is related to the increase in current year sales.
24090_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	Commission expense was comparable for all three periods presented based upon fluctuations in premiums collected.
24090_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	Expenses increased 53.4% due primarily to increased company-allocated expenses based upon our annual time study and related to legal, consulting and audit fees, as well as higher salaries, bonuses and related employee benefits paid to top executives.
24090_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	Expenses are allocated by segment based upon an annual expense study performed by the Company.
24090_18_ITEM7_P104_S1	We recorded expenses in 2017 related to the write-off of our Home Service goodwill value of $4.6 million.
24090_18_ITEM7_P104_S2	The 2017 expenses related to the IRC tax compliance issue for life and annuity insurance remediation expense remained flat compared to the 2016 expense, while in 2016 the expense decreased $1.7 million due to further refinement of our estimates.
24090_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	Capitalization and Amortization of DAC .
24090_18_ITEM7_P105_S1	DAC capitalization is directly correlated to fluctuations in first year commissions.
24090_18_ITEM7_P105_S2	Amortization of DAC increased from 2016 to 2017 by 7.5% and by 21.1% from 2015 to 2016 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	2016 was primarily due to an increase in surrenders, although both 2016 and 2017 increases reflect the impact of updated annual U.S. GAAP assumptions as well.
24090_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	We monitor lapse rates as a key component of our insurance operations.
24090_18_ITEM7_P108_S0	This operating unit represents the administrative support entities to the insurance operations whose revenues are primarily intercompany and have been eliminated in consolidation under U.S. GAAP, which typically results in a segment loss.
24090_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	Financial stability and capital preservation are important investment considerations for the Company.
24090_18_ITEM7_P109_S1	A primary investment goal is the conservation of assets due to the long-term nature of a significant portion of our liabilities.
24090_18_ITEM7_P109_S2	The administration of our investment portfolios is handled internally, pursuant to board-approved investment guidelines, with all trading activity approved by a committee of each entity s respective board of directors.
24090_18_ITEM7_P109_S3	The guidelines used require that securities are of high quality and investment grade.
24090_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	State insurance statutes prescribe the quality and percentage of the various types of investments that may be made by insurance companies and generally permit investment in qualified state, municipal, federal and foreign government obligations, high quality corporate bonds, preferred and common stock, mortgage loans and real estate within certain specified percentages.
24090_18_ITEM7_P110_S1	The assets selected are generally intended to mature in accordance with the average maturity of the insurance products and to provide the cash flow for our insurance company subsidiaries to meet their respective policyholder obligations.
24090_18_ITEM7_P110_S2	Due to the prolonged low interest rate environment, we have intentionally shortened the duration of our asset portfolio to capitalize on new investment purchases as interest rates rise.
24090_18_ITEM7_P110_S3	As rates rise, we plan to extend assets durations and increase investment yields.
24090_18_ITEM7_P111_S0	The following table shows the carrying value of our investments by investment category and cash and cash equivalents, and the percentage of each to total invested assets.
24090_18_ITEM7_P112_S0	(1) Includes $244.3 million and $273.4 million of securities guaranteed by third parties for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
24090_18_ITEM7_P112_S1	(2) Includes $1.8 million and $2.2 million of U.S. Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprise for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
24090_18_ITEM7_P113_S0	The Company has increased investments in corporate fixed maturity securities as municipal fixed maturity securities matured in the current year.
24090_18_ITEM7_P114_S0	At December 31, 2017 , investments in fixed maturity and equity securities were 90.5% of our total cash, cash equivalents and investments.
24090_18_ITEM7_P114_S1	All of our fixed maturities were classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P114_S2	We had no fixed maturity or equity securities that were classified as trading securities at December 31, 2017 or 2016 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P115_S0	The following table shows investment yields by segment operations as of December 31 for each year presented.
24090_18_ITEM7_P116_S0	Yields on investment assets vary between segment operations due to different portfolio mixes and durations in the segments.
24090_18_ITEM7_P116_S1	The life segment previously invested more in U.S. Government securities, however over the past few years it has invested in municipal and corporate issuers and is now more similar to the home service segment which has had concentrations primarily in the municipal and corporate sectors.
24090_18_ITEM7_P117_S0	Credit ratings reported for the periods indicated are assigned by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ("NRSRO") such as Moody s Investors Service, Standard Poor s and Fitch Ratings.
24090_18_ITEM7_P117_S1	A credit rating assigned by a NRSRO is a quality based rating, with AAA representing the highest quality and D the lowest, with BBB and above being considered investment grade.
24090_18_ITEM7_P117_S2	In addition, the Company may use credit ratings of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") Securities Valuation Office ("SVO") as assigned, if there is no NRSRO rating.
24090_18_ITEM7_P117_S3	Securities rated by the SVO are grouped in the equivalent NRSRO category as stated by the SVO and securities that are not rated by a NRSRO are included in the "other" category.
24090_18_ITEM7_P118_S0	The following table shows the distribution of the credit ratings of our portfolio of fixed maturity securities by carrying value.
24090_18_ITEM7_P119_S0	The Company made new investments in A and BBB rated corporate bonds during 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P120_S0	Non-investment grade securities are the result of downgrades of issuers or securities acquired during acquisitions of companies, as the Company does not purchase below investment grade securities.
24090_18_ITEM7_P121_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company held municipal fixed maturity securities that include third party guarantees.
24090_18_ITEM7_P121_S1	Detailed below is a presentation by NRSRO rating of our municipal holdings by funding type.
24090_18_ITEM7_P122_S0	The Company held investments in special revenue bonds that were greater than 10% of fair value based upon the Company's portfolio of fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2017 , as shown in the table below.
24090_18_ITEM7_P123_S0	The tables below represent the Company s detailed exposure to municipal holdings in Louisiana, Texas and Florida, which comprise the most significant state concentrations of the total municipal fixed maturity portfolio as of December 31, 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P124_S0	The Company invests in municipal securities of issuers in the state of Louisiana and receives a credit that reduces its premium tax liability in that state.
24090_18_ITEM7_P124_S1	At December 31, 2017 , total holdings of municipal securities in Louisiana represented 4.2% of all municipal holdings based upon fair value.
24090_18_ITEM7_P125_S0	The Company also holds 22.8% of its municipal holdings in Texas issuers.
24090_18_ITEM7_P126_S0	The Company also holds 12.0% of its municipal holdings in Florida issuers.
24090_18_ITEM7_P127_S0	There were no other states or individual issuer holdings that represented or exceeded 10% of the total municipal portfolio as of December 31, 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P128_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of our fixed maturity and equity securities at least quarterly.
24090_18_ITEM7_P129_S0	The Company monitors all debt and equity securities on an on-going basis relative to changes in credit ratings, market prices, earnings trends and financial performance, in addition to specific region or industry reviews.
24090_18_ITEM7_P130_S0	The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on a case-by-case evaluation of underlying reasons for the decline in fair value.
24090_18_ITEM7_P131_S0	The Company determines other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) by reviewing all relevant evidence related to the specific security issuer as well as the Company's intent to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost.
24090_18_ITEM7_P132_S0	When an OTTI has occurred, the amount of the OTTI recognized in earnings depends on whether the Company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis.
24090_18_ITEM7_P132_S1	If the Company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, an OTTI is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_18_ITEM7_P132_S2	If the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Company is required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the OTTI will be separated into the following: a) the amount representing the credit loss; and b) the amount related to all other factors.
24090_18_ITEM7_P132_S3	The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings.
24090_18_ITEM7_P132_S4	The amount of the total OTTI related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_18_ITEM7_P132_S5	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_18_ITEM7_P132_S6	The new amortized cost is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value.
24090_18_ITEM7_P133_S0	In 2017 and 2016 , the Company recognized losses on other-than-temporary impairments totaling $0.2 million and $4.3 million , respectively, related to bond and mutual fund holdings.
24090_18_ITEM7_P133_S1	In 2015 , impairments of $5.4 million were recorded as a result of our OTTI analysis.
24090_18_ITEM7_P133_S2	Based upon our analysis of whether declines in fair value below cost are temporary or other-than-temporary, management believes that our investments in fixed maturity investments at December 31, 2017 were not impaired, and no additional other-than-temporary losses were recorded.
24090_18_ITEM7_P134_S0	Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities available-for-sale amounted to $3.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and $9.2 million as of December 31, 2016 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P134_S1	This decrease in gross unrealized losses during 2017 was a result of a decrease in the interest rate environment in the fourth quarter of 2016.
24090_18_ITEM7_P134_S2	Gross unrealized losses on equity securities were $6,000 as of December 31, 2017 and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2016 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P135_S0	As is customary among insurance companies, our insurance company subsidiaries reinsure with other companies portions of the life insurance risks they underwrite.
24090_18_ITEM7_P135_S1	A primary purpose of reinsurance agreements is to enable an insurance company to reduce the amount of risk by reinsuring the amount exceeding the maximum amount the insurance company is willing to retain.
24090_18_ITEM7_P135_S2	Even though a portion of the risk may be reinsured, our insurance company subsidiaries remain liable to perform all the obligations imposed by the policies issued by them and could be liable if their reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements.
24090_18_ITEM7_P136_S0	We believe we have established appropriate reinsurance coverage based upon our net retained insured liabilities compared to our surplus.
24090_18_ITEM7_P137_S0	The effect of reinsurance on premiums is as follows.
24090_18_ITEM7_P138_S0	Our insurance subsidiaries monitor the solvency of their reinsurers in seeking to minimize the risk of loss in the event of default by a reinsurer.
24090_18_ITEM7_P139_S0	The primary reinsurers of our insurance subsidiaries are large, well-capitalized entities.
24090_18_ITEM7_P140_S0	The effect of reinsurance on life insurance in force is as follows.
24090_18_ITEM7_P141_S0	Virtually all of the Company's non-credit accident and health insurance has been reinsured and is administered by Unified Life Insurance Company, an unaffiliated party.
24090_18_ITEM7_P141_S1	The reinsurance recoverables under this agreement are collateralized by assets held in a trust for the benefit of the reinsured policies.
24090_18_ITEM7_P142_S0	The Company monitors the credit ratings of our life and property reinsurers.
24090_18_ITEM7_P142_S1	The ratings by A.M. Best Company range from B+ (Good) to A+ (Superior).
24090_18_ITEM7_P143_S0	SPFIC has first and second event catastrophe reinsurance coverage of $10.0 million per event and a retention level of $500,000 per event.
24090_18_ITEM7_P143_S1	Thus, the first $500,000 of incurred claims and any claims in excess of $10.0 million are SPFIC's responsibility.
24090_18_ITEM7_P144_S0	The reinsurance premium for first event catastrophe reinsurance was $781,000 , $828,000 and $873,000 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
24090_18_ITEM7_P145_S0	Liquidity refers to a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the needs of its operations.
24090_18_ITEM7_P145_S1	Liquidity is managed on insurance operations to ensure stable and reliable sources of cash flows to meet obligations and is provided by a variety of sources.
24090_18_ITEM7_P146_S0	Our liquidity requirements are met primarily by funds provided from operations.
24090_18_ITEM7_P146_S1	Premium deposits and revenues, investment income and investment maturities are the primary sources of funds, while investment purchases, policy benefits, and operating expenses are the primary uses of funds.
24090_18_ITEM7_P146_S2	We historically have not had to liquidate investments to provide cash flow, and there were no liquidity issues in 2017 or 2016 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P146_S3	Our investments consist of 74.6% of marketable debt securities and 1.2% of equity securities classified as available-for-sale that could be readily converted to cash for liquidity needs.
24090_18_ITEM7_P147_S0	A primary liquidity concern is the risk of an extraordinary level of early policyholder withdrawals.
24090_18_ITEM7_P147_S1	We include provisions within our insurance policies, such as surrender charges, that help limit and discourage early withdrawals.
24090_18_ITEM7_P147_S2	Since these contractual withdrawals, as well as the level of surrenders experienced, have been largely consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management, our associated cash outflows historically have not had an adverse impact on our overall liquidity.
24090_18_ITEM7_P148_S0	Individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy.
24090_18_ITEM7_P148_S1	Cash flow projections and cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios are also performed annually to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy.
24090_18_ITEM7_P149_S0	Our whole life and endowment products provide the policyholder with alternatives once the policy matures.
24090_18_ITEM7_P149_S1	The policyholder can choose to take a lump sum payout or leave the money on deposit at interest with the Company.
24090_18_ITEM7_P149_S2	The Company has a significant amount of endowment products representing approximately 45-49% of total inforce with older contracts sold historically that will begin reaching their maturities over the next several years and policyholder election behavior is not known.
24090_18_ITEM7_P149_S3	If policyholders elect lump sum distributions, the Company could be exposed to liquidity risk in years of high maturities.
24090_18_ITEM7_P149_S4	Meeting these distributions could require the Company to sell securities at inopportune times to pay policyholder withdrawals.
24090_18_ITEM7_P149_S5	Alternatively, if the policyholder were to leave the money on deposit with the Company at interest, our profitability could be impacted if the product guaranteed rate is higher than the current market rate we can earn on our investments.
24090_18_ITEM7_P149_S6	We currently anticipate that available liquidity sources and future cash flows will be adequate to meet our needs for funds, but we will monitor closely our policyholder behavior patterns.
24090_18_ITEM7_P150_S0	A large portion of our debt security investment portfolio will mature in the next seven years and could be called sooner as we were subject to significant call activity beginning in 2009 due to the declining interest rate environment and we reinvested into shorter durations that are now approaching maturity.
24090_18_ITEM7_P150_S1	We will need to reinvest these maturing funds in the current interest rate environment.
24090_18_ITEM7_P150_S2	Our profitability could be negatively impacted depending on the market rates at the time of reinvestment.
24090_18_ITEM7_P150_S3	This could result in a decrease in our spread between our policy liability crediting rates and our investment earned rates.
24090_18_ITEM7_P150_S4	This could also negatively impact our liquidity.
24090_18_ITEM7_P151_S0	Cash flows from our insurance operations historically have been sufficient to meet current needs.
24090_18_ITEM7_P151_S1	Cash flows from operating activities were $93.0 million , $102.3 million and $87.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
24090_18_ITEM7_P151_S2	Operating cash flow declined in 2017 , due primarily to additional audit fees related to the 2016 audit, internal audit support, higher legal and consulting fees and higher permanent executive salaries and policyholder benefits.
24090_18_ITEM7_P151_S3	We have traditionally also had significant cash flows from both scheduled and unscheduled fixed maturity security calls, maturities, redemptions, and prepayments, which totaled $84.0 million , $70.4 million and $95.6 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P151_S4	These cash flows, for the most part, are reinvested in fixed income securities.
24090_18_ITEM7_P151_S5	Net cash outflows from investment activity totaled $85.0 million , $152.1 million and $58.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
24090_18_ITEM7_P151_S6	The outflows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 , primarily related to the investment of excess cash and cash equivalents generated from operations during 2017 and 2016 , in addition to the investment of excess cash held at the end of 2015.
24090_18_ITEM7_P151_S7	The Company's cash flows from financing activities were $2.5 million in 2017 , $2.5 million in 2016 and $3.0 million in 2015 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P152_S0	See "Parent Company Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for a discussion of additional Parent Company liquidity.
24090_18_ITEM7_P153_S0	In 2015, we determined that a portion of the life insurance and annuity policies issued by our subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702 and 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") of 1986.
24090_18_ITEM7_P153_S1	As a result, we have established a liability reserve of $ 12.3 million, net of tax for probable liabilities and expenses associated with this tax compliance matter, which represents management s best estimate and we have disclosed an estimated range related to probable liabilities and expenses of $5.9 million to $48.2 million , net of tax.
24090_18_ITEM7_P153_S2	This estimate and range includes projected toll charges and fees payable to the IRS, as well as estimated increased payout obligations to current and former holders of non-compliant domestic life insurance policies expected to result from remediation of those policies.
24090_18_ITEM7_P153_S3	The amount of our liabilities and expenses depends on a number of uncertainties, including the number of prior tax years for which we may be liable to the IRS, the number of domestic life insurance policies we will be required to remediate, and the methodology applicable to the calculation of the toll charge for non-compliant policies.
24090_18_ITEM7_P153_S4	Given the range of potential outcomes and the significant variables assumed in establishing our estimates, actual amounts incurred may exceed our reserve and also could exceed the high end of our estimated range of liabilities and expenses.
24090_18_ITEM7_P154_S0	This tax compliance issue impacts our policyholders and their tax liabilities relative to these products that fail 7702 and 72(s) for those that will not be remediated.
24090_18_ITEM7_P155_S0	The exposure related to future sales or products in force is unknown at this time.
24090_18_ITEM7_P155_S1	Policyholders could decide to surrender their policies due to this issue which would subsequently result in higher cash outflows due to an increase in surrender activity.
24090_18_ITEM7_P156_S0	The NAIC has established minimum capital requirements in the form of RBC.
24090_18_ITEM7_P156_S1	RBC considers the type of business written by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company's business to develop a minimum level of capital called "Authorized Control Level Risk-based Capital" and compares this level to an adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves.
24090_18_ITEM7_P156_S2	Should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk-based capital fall below 200%, a series of remedial actions by the affected company would be required.
24090_18_ITEM7_P157_S0	At December 31, 2017 , all of our insurance subsidiaries were above the required minimum RBC levels.
24090_18_ITEM7_P158_S0	In 2017 , Citizens made a $5.0 million capital contribution to CICA Life.
24090_18_ITEM7_P158_S1	In the third quarter of 2017, Citizens contributed $250,000 to CICA Life Ltd. to capitalize a newly formed Bermuda entity, SPLIC contributed $250,000 in capital to MGLIC, and SPLIC declared a dividend payable to CICA of $395,000 which will be paid in 2018.
24090_18_ITEM7_P159_S0	On November 1, 2016, SPLIC paid a $20.0 million extraordinary dividend to its parent, CICA.
24090_18_ITEM7_P159_S1	The dividend had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and was used by CICA for general corporate purposes.
24090_18_ITEM7_P159_S2	The dividend was approved by the Louisiana Department of Insurance, SPLIC s state of domicile.
24090_18_ITEM7_P159_S3	SPLIC s risk-based capital after the dividend remains is in excess of minimum capital requirements.
24090_18_ITEM7_P160_S0	In the second quarter of 2016, Citizens, Inc. purchased Class A Common shares from CTI with an approximate fair value of $0.8 million.
24090_18_ITEM7_P161_S0	We have committed to the following contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 , with the payments due by the period indicated below:
24090_18_ITEM7_P162_S0	The payments related to the future policy benefits and policy claims payable reflected in the table above have been projected utilizing assumptions based upon our historical experience and anticipated future experience.
24090_18_ITEM7_P163_S0	The Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2017 and, therefore, does not expect any future effects on the Company's financial condition related to any such arrangements.
24090_18_ITEM7_P164_S0	We do not utilize special purpose entities as investment vehicles, nor are there any such entities in which we have an investment that engages in speculative activities of any nature, and we do not use such investments to hedge our investment positions.
24090_18_ITEM7_P165_S0	Citizens is a holding company and has had minimal operations of its own.
24090_18_ITEM7_P165_S1	Our assets consist of the capital stock of our subsidiaries, cash, fixed income securities, mutual funds and investment real estate.
24090_18_ITEM7_P165_S2	Our cash flows depend primarily upon the availability of statutorily permissible payments, primarily payments under management agreements from our two primary life insurance subsidiaries, CICA and SPLIC.
24090_18_ITEM7_P165_S3	The ability to make payments is limited by applicable laws and regulations of Colorado, CICA's state of domicile, and Louisiana, SPLIC's state of domicile, which subject insurance operations to significant regulatory restrictions.
24090_18_ITEM7_P165_S4	These laws and regulations require, among other things, that these insurance subsidiaries maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company.
24090_18_ITEM7_P166_S0	We historically have not relied upon dividends from subsidiaries for our cash flow needs.
24090_18_ITEM7_P166_S1	However, CICA and SPLIC both dividend available funds from time to time in relation to business strategies.
24090_18_ITEM7_P167_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , Citizens had fixed maturities available for sale of $39.5 million and cash of $23.9 million , which represents additional liquidity for future acquisitions, liquidity support for the life insurance companies and for general corporate purposes.
24090_18_ITEM7_P168_S0	Additionally, a substantial portion of our international policyholders invest their policy cash dividends and benefits in our Class A common stock through our Stock Investment Plan (the Plan ).
24090_18_ITEM7_P168_S1	Once a policyholder elects to participate in the Plan, their policy benefits can be used to purchase Citizens Class A common stock through the Plan in the open market.
24090_18_ITEM7_P168_S2	In addition, our existing holders of Class A common stock, our employees and our independent consultants are eligible to participate in the Plan.
24090_18_ITEM7_P168_S3	If fewer policyholders elect to participate in the Plan, or if our international premium collections were to decrease as a result of regulatory or marketing impediments, the trading volume of our Class A common stock may decline from its present levels.
24090_18_ITEM7_P169_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
24090_18_ITEM7_P169_S1	Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM7_P169_S2	While we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available.
24090_18_ITEM7_P169_S3	Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
24090_18_ITEM7_P170_S0	Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.
24090_18_ITEM7_P170_S1	See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Company's consolidated financial statements for further information on our critical accounting policies.
24090_18_ITEM7_P171_S0	Our critical accounting policies are as follows:
24090_18_ITEM7_P172_S0	Future policy benefit reserves have been computed by the net level premium method with assumptions as to investment yields, dividends on participating business, mortality and withdrawals based upon our experience.
24090_18_ITEM7_P172_S1	The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of policy liabilities and the increase in future policy benefit reserves.
24090_18_ITEM7_P172_S2	Management's judgments and estimates for future policy benefit reserves provide for possible unfavorable deviation.
24090_18_ITEM7_P173_S0	We continue to use the original assumptions (including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation) in subsequent periods to determine the changes in the liability for future policy benefits (the "lock-in concept ) unless a premium deficiency exists.
24090_18_ITEM7_P173_S1	Management monitors these assumptions and has determined that a premium deficiency did not exist as of December 31, 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P173_S2	Management believes that our policy liabilities and increase in future policy benefit reserves as of the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 are based upon assumptions, including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation, that do not warrant revision.
24090_18_ITEM7_P174_S0	Acquisition costs, consisting of commissions and policy issuance, underwriting and agency expenses that relate to and vary with the successful production of new business, are deferred.
24090_18_ITEM7_P174_S1	These deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized primarily over the premium-paying period of the policies, using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_18_ITEM7_P175_S0	We utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance.
24090_18_ITEM7_P175_S1	The factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period.
24090_18_ITEM7_P175_S2	The factor method ensures that policies which lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation.
24090_18_ITEM7_P175_S3	The factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value, provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors.
24090_18_ITEM7_P176_S0	Inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred, the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_18_ITEM7_P176_S1	Approximately 95.0% of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year and renewal excess commissions.
24090_18_ITEM7_P176_S2	The remaining 5.0% are attributed to other costs that vary with and are directly related to the successful acquisition of new insurance business.
24090_18_ITEM7_P176_S3	Those costs generally include costs related to the production, underwriting and issuance of new business.
24090_18_ITEM7_P177_S0	DAC is subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issuance and loss recognition testing on an annual basis, or when an event occurs that might require loss recognition testing.
24090_18_ITEM7_P177_S1	If loss recognition or impairment is necessary, DAC would be written off to the extent that anticipated future premiums and investment income is insufficient to cover expected future policy benefits and expenses.
24090_18_ITEM7_P178_S0	Loss recognition testing that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience calculates the available premium (gross premium less the benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 50 years.
24090_18_ITEM7_P179_S0	premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated.
24090_18_ITEM7_P179_S1	The deferred policy acquisition costs are then evaluated for recoverability using best estimate assumptions.
24090_18_ITEM7_P179_S2	Management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value.
24090_18_ITEM7_P179_S3	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on capitalized expenses that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business, utilization of the factor method and recoverability testing at the time of policy issuance and the annual loss recognition testing.
24090_18_ITEM7_P180_S0	Cost of Customer Relationships Acquired ("CCRA") is established when we purchase a block of insurance.
24090_18_ITEM7_P180_S1	CCRA is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_18_ITEM7_P181_S0	We utilize various methods to determine the amount of the ending asset balance, including a static model and a dynamic model.
24090_18_ITEM7_P181_S1	Inherent in the amortization of CCRA are certain management judgments about the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_18_ITEM7_P181_S2	The assumptions used are based upon interest, mortality and lapses at the time of purchase.
24090_18_ITEM7_P182_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_18_ITEM7_P182_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 50 years.
24090_18_ITEM7_P182_S2	The CCRA is then evaluated for recoverability utilizing best estimate assumptions.
24090_18_ITEM7_P182_S3	Management believes our CCRA and related amortization is recoverable for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
24090_18_ITEM7_P182_S4	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on estimated future results of the block and our annual recoverability testing.
24090_18_ITEM7_P183_S0	Current accounting guidance requires that goodwill balances be reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event has occurred.
24090_18_ITEM7_P184_S0	A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment on one level below an operating segment.
24090_18_ITEM7_P184_S1	Most of the Company's reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated, are equivalent to the Company's operating segment, as there is no discrete financial information reviewed and analyzed by management for the separate components of the segment or all of the components of the segment have similar economic characteristics.
24090_18_ITEM7_P185_S0	The Company historically has performed a goodwill impairment test that follows a multi-step process as defined under current accounting guidance.
24090_18_ITEM7_P185_S1	An initial review may be performed whereby the assessment is based upon qualitative factors before performing the first test step.
24090_18_ITEM7_P186_S0	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
24090_18_ITEM7_P186_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment.
24090_18_ITEM7_P186_S2	In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value.
24090_18_ITEM7_P186_S3	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
24090_18_ITEM7_P187_S0	No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairmen t as discussed in Part IV, Note 1 - "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies".
24090_18_ITEM7_P188_S0	This ASU eliminates the step two test as noted above.
24090_18_ITEM7_P189_S0	Management s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations based on assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit.
24090_18_ITEM7_P189_S1	Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections.
24090_18_ITEM7_P190_S0	The evaluation of securities for impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings.
24090_18_ITEM7_P190_S1	The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition or future prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period.
24090_18_ITEM7_P191_S0	Based upon current accounting guidance, investment securities must be classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading.
24090_18_ITEM7_P191_S1	Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase.
24090_18_ITEM7_P192_S0	The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities.
24090_18_ITEM7_P193_S0	held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the Company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity.
24090_18_ITEM7_P193_S1	Securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings until realized.
24090_18_ITEM7_P194_S0	The Company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if an OTTI exists pursuant to the accounting guidelines.
24090_18_ITEM7_P194_S1	In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the ability and intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
24090_18_ITEM7_P194_S2	In analyzing an issuer's financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the Federal government or its agencies, by government-sponsored agencies, or whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and reviews of the issuer's financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM7_P195_S0	If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, management must then determine the amount of OTTI to be recognized in earnings.
24090_18_ITEM7_P195_S1	If management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.
24090_18_ITEM7_P195_S2	The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.
24090_18_ITEM7_P195_S3	The amount of OTTI related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
24090_18_ITEM7_P195_S4	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_18_ITEM7_P195_S5	If management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_18_ITEM7_P195_S6	Any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain (as other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold.
24090_18_ITEM7_P196_S0	The Company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions, future market movements, business plan changes, or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time.
24090_18_ITEM7_P197_S0	Premiums on life and accident and health policies are reported as earned when due or, for short duration contracts, over the contract period on a pro rata basis.
24090_18_ITEM7_P197_S1	Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in recognition of profits over the estimated life of the contracts.
24090_18_ITEM7_P197_S2	This matching is accomplished by means of provisions for future benefits and the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_18_ITEM7_P198_S0	Annuities are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest bearing financial instruments.
24090_18_ITEM7_P199_S0	Our primary annuity products do not include fees or other such charges.
24090_18_ITEM7_P200_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
24090_18_ITEM7_P200_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
24090_18_ITEM7_P200_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in net income in the period in which the change is enacted.
24090_18_ITEM7_P200_S3	Given the enactment of the New Tax Act on December 22, 2017, we have re-measured our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to the new corporate tax rate of 21% which resulted in a $35.7 million tax expense.
24090_18_ITEM7_P201_S0	An estimated loss from a contingency is accrued and charged to results of operations only if both of the following conditions are met:
24090_18_ITEM7_P202_S0	The amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
24090_18_ITEM7_P203_S0	Reasonable estimation of a possible loss does not require estimating a single amount of the loss.
24090_18_ITEM7_P203_S1	It requires that a loss be accrued if it can be estimated within a range.
24090_18_ITEM7_P203_S2	If an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, that amount is accrued.
24090_18_ITEM7_P203_S3	If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
24090_18_ITEM7_P204_S0	A gain contingency is an uncertain situation that will be resolved in the future, possibly resulting in a gain.
24090_18_ITEM7_P204_S1	We do not allow the recognition of a gain contingency prior to settlement of the underlying event.
24090_18_ITEM7_P204_S2	If we were to have a gain contingency, we would disclose it in the notes to the financial statements.
24090_18_ITEM7_P205_S0	"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," and Note 1 - "Accounting Pronouncements" to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The nature of our business exposes us to market risk relative to our invested assets and policy liabilities.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Market risk is the risk of loss that may occur when changes in interest rates and public equity prices adversely affect the value of our invested assets.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Interest rate risk is our primary market risk exposure.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can affect the fair value of our investments.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio generally increases when interest rates decrease and decreases when interest rates increase.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The following table summarizes net unrealized gains and losses as of the dates indicated.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our exposure to interest rate changes results from our significant holdings of fixed maturity investments, policy loans and mortgage loans on real estate, all of which comprised over 94.8% of our cash and investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	These investments are mainly exposed to changes in U.S. Treasury rates.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Our fixed maturities investments include U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, U.S. Government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, state and municipal bonds, and corporate bonds.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Approximately 64.8% of the fixed maturities we owned at market value on December 31, 2017 are state and political subdivisions which are primarily municipal holdings.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P2_S4	These holdings are diversified over several states though approximately 40% of our state and municipal securities are concentrated in three states - Texas, Florida and Louisiana.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Changes in interest rates typically have a sizable effect on the fair value of our debt and equities securities.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The interest rate of the ten-year U.S. Treasury bond decreased to 2.40% at December 31, 2017 , from 2.45% at December 31, 2016 .
24090_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities totaled $46.0 million at December 31, 2017 , compared to $26.7 million at December 31, 2016 , based upon bond interest rates in relation to the U. S. ten-year Treasury yield.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	To manage interest risk, we perform periodic projections of asset and liability cash flows to evaluate the potential sensitivity of our investments and liabilities.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	We assess interest rate sensitivity on an annual basis with respect to our fixed maturities investments using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward shifts in the prevailing interest rates.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The Company performed an analysis of fair value changes using assumed 100 basis point shifts in interest rates, noting that the fair value of our fixed maturity investment portfolio of $1.2 billion would decrease approximately $9.6 million to a fair value of $1.2 billion upon a 100 basis point increase.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The following table shows the effects on the fair values of our fixed maturity investments based upon these scenarios.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	While the test scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed-income markets, it is a near-term change that illustrates the potential impact of such events.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Due to the composition of our book of insurance business, we believe it is unlikely we would encounter large surrender activity due to an interest rate increase that would force us to dispose of our fixed maturities at a loss.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Our fixed maturity portfolio is exposed to call risk as a significant portion of the current holdings are callable.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P8_S1	A decreasing interest rate environment can result in increased call activity as experienced over the past several years, and an increasing rate environment will likely result in securities being paid at their stated maturity.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P9_S0	There are no fixed maturities or other investments that we classify as trading instruments.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Approximately 80.1% of fixed maturities were held in available-for-sale and 19.9% in held-to-maturity based upon fair value at December 31, 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM7A_P9_S2	At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had no investments in derivative instruments, subprime loans or CDOs (collateralized debt obligations).
24090_18_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Changes in the level or volatility of equity prices affect the value of equity securities we hold as investments.
24090_18_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Our equity investments portfolio represented 1.2% of our total investments at December 31, 2017 , with 96.4% invested in diversified equity and bond mutual funds.
24090_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	Reference is made to the consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto, and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm, as listed on the table of contents.
24090_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	All other schedules have been omitted as the required information is inapplicable or the information required is presented in the financial statements or the notes thereto filed elsewhere herein.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and principal operating officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2017, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
24090_18_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Management evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO 2013").
24090_18_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 was not effective due to the material weaknesses described below.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A material weakness, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2, is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	We did not have a sufficient number of competent individuals to design, document, maintain, and execute an appropriate system of controls.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P4_S1	In addition, the Company did not provide comprehensive employee training covering COSO 2013 internal control awareness, as required.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P4_S2	As a result, we identified control deficiencies in aggregate that constitute material weaknesses in each of the five components of internal control as defined by COSO 2013 (control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring), which resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P4_S3	In part, management identified deficiencies related to its internal staff competency and expertise related to information technology, internal audit, and certain management estimates.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P4_S4	As a result of these deficiencies, the Company did not design and maintain effective:
24090_18_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Information technology controls, which includes information security, systems change management and computer operations for systems and applications that are critical to processing financial transactions and capturing and reporting information in the financial reporting process.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Controls over the accuracy and completeness of spreadsheets and system-generated reports.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Controls related to monitoring of information provided by third party service providers for the preparation of certain management estimates, including but not limited to the valuation of certain insurance reserves and the computation of income taxes.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Management has concluded that the Company s outsourced service provider policy that governs the data validation controls over data provided to and received from third party service providers and the monitoring, business process and management review controls were not designed with appropriate levels of precision.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P8_S1	The report is included in item 9A(c) of this annual report.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P9_S0	To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Citizens, Inc.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Citizens, Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
24090_18_ITEM9A_P10_S1	In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses identified below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P10_S2	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, of the Company and our report dated March 29, 2018 , expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P10_S3	Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P10_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P10_S5	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P10_S6	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P10_S7	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P10_S8	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P10_S9	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P11_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P11_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P11_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P11_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Material Weaknesses A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P12_S1	Management identified material weaknesses in the Company s overall control environment due to the aggregate effect of multiple deficiencies in internal controls, which affected each of the five components of internal control as defined by COSO (control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring).
24090_18_ITEM9A_P13_S0	These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, of the Company, and this report does not affect our report on such consolidated financial statements.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P14_S0	There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P15_S0	During 2017, management initiated the following remediation efforts to address the identified material weaknesses described above and to enhance our competency within certain areas of the financial control environment, though these efforts cannot be considered fully remediated until the applicable remedial controls are designed and operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through its evaluation, that the following personnel enhancements to the control environment are in place as of December 31, 2017:
24090_18_ITEM9A_P16_S0	Enhanced our internal control program and remediation efforts by co-sourcing our internal audit function to an experienced, nationally recognized audit firm.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P16_S1	At the direction of management and specifically the internal control task force, the co-sourcing provider will continue to assist the internal control task force to enhance the evaluation of the control environment against the criteria established in COSO 2013.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P17_S0	Added an Interim Chief Information Officer who will focus on enhancing our general IT controls, including required remediation and control improvements.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P18_S0	While the enhancements described above demonstrate a commitment to strengthening the control environment by attracting, developing and retaining competent personnel and outsourced service providers to support the achievement of the Company s objectives, they occurred during the latter half of 2017.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P18_S1	Management intends to take the following actions to further remediate deficiencies during 2018, including enhancing their ability to demonstrate the criteria and principles established in COSO 2013:
24090_18_ITEM9A_P19_S0	Reevaluate the criteria established in COSO 2013 to make further enhancements to entity-level controls in order to demonstrate that our internal controls framework addresses relevant principles and components of COSO 2013.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P20_S0	We believe the remediation steps outlined above have improved and will continue to improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our COSO 2013 framework as a whole.
24090_18_ITEM9A_P20_S1	We will test the ongoing operating effectiveness of all new controls subsequent to implementation and consider the material weaknesses remediated after the applicable remedial controls operate effectively for a sufficient period of time.
24090_18_ITEM9B_P0_S0	The information in this Part III indicated below is incorporated by reference from other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or from our definitive proxy statement pursuant to General Instruction G(3) of Form 10-K.

24090_18_ITEM15_P24_S1	Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase.
24090_18_ITEM15_P25_S0	The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities.
24090_18_ITEM15_P25_S1	Fixed maturity securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the Company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity.

24090_18_ITEM15_P28_S0	The Company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if an other-than-temporary impairment ("OTTI") exists pursuant to the accounting guidelines.
24090_18_ITEM15_P28_S1	In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the ability and intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
24090_18_ITEM15_P28_S2	In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the Federal government or its agencies, by government-sponsored agencies, or whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and reviews of the issuer s financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM15_P29_S0	If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, management must then determine the amount of OTTI to be recognized in earnings.
24090_18_ITEM15_P29_S1	If management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.
24090_18_ITEM15_P29_S2	The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings.
24090_18_ITEM15_P30_S0	The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
24090_18_ITEM15_P30_S1	If management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.
24090_18_ITEM15_P30_S2	Any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain (as other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold.
24090_18_ITEM15_P31_S0	The Company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions, future market movements, business plan changes, or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time.

24090_18_ITEM15_P39_S2	This matching is accomplished by means of a provision for future policy benefits and the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.
24090_18_ITEM15_P40_S0	Annuity policies, primarily flexible premium fixed annuity products, are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest bearing financial instruments.

24090_18_ITEM15_P41_S0	Acquisition costs, consisting of commissions and policy issuance, underwriting and agent convention expenses that are directly related to and vary with the successful production of new and renewal business, have been deferred.
24090_18_ITEM15_P41_S1	These deferred amounts, referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC"), are recorded as an asset on the consolidated balance sheet and amortized to income in a systematic manner, based on related contract revenues or gross profits as appropriate.
24090_18_ITEM15_P42_S0	Traditional life insurance and accident and health insurance acquisition costs are being amortized over the premium-paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing future policy benefit liabilities.
24090_18_ITEM15_P42_S1	For universal life type contracts and investment contracts that include significant surrender charges or that yield significant revenues from sources other than the investment contract holders' funds, the deferred contract acquisition cost amortization is matched to the recognition of gross profit.
24090_18_ITEM15_P42_S2	The effect on the DAC asset that would result from realization of unrealized gains or losses is recognized with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income in consolidated stockholders' equity.
24090_18_ITEM15_P43_S0	through income and any new deferrable costs associated with the new replacement are deferred.
24090_18_ITEM15_P43_S1	If a contract modification does not substantially change the contract, the DAC amortization on the original contract will continue and any acquisition costs associated with the related modification are immediately expensed.
24090_18_ITEM15_P44_S0	We utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance.
24090_18_ITEM15_P44_S1	The factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period.
24090_18_ITEM15_P44_S2	The factor method ensures that policies lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation.
24090_18_ITEM15_P44_S3	The factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value, provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors.
24090_18_ITEM15_P45_S0	Inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred, the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_18_ITEM15_P45_S1	Approximately 95% of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year and renewal excess commissions.
24090_18_ITEM15_P45_S2	The remaining 5% are attributed to costs that vary with and are directly related to the successful acquisition of new insurance business.
24090_18_ITEM15_P45_S3	Those costs generally include costs related to the production, underwriting and issuance of new business.
24090_18_ITEM15_P46_S0	DAC is subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issuance and loss recognition testing on an annual basis, or when an event occurs that might require loss recognition testing.
24090_18_ITEM15_P46_S1	If loss recognition or impairment is necessary, DAC would be written off to the extent that anticipated future premiums and investment income is insufficient to cover expected future policy benefits and expenses.
24090_18_ITEM15_P47_S0	Loss recognition testing that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience calculates the available premium (gross premium less the benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 50 years.
24090_18_ITEM15_P47_S1	The available premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated.
24090_18_ITEM15_P47_S2	The deferred policy acquisition costs are then evaluated for recoverability using best estimate assumptions.
24090_18_ITEM15_P47_S3	Management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value.
24090_18_ITEM15_P47_S4	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on capitalized expenses that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business, utilization of the factor method and recoverability testing at the time of policy issuance and the annual loss recognition testing.
24090_18_ITEM15_P48_S0	The components of deferred acquisition costs from year to year are summarized as follows:
24090_18_ITEM15_P49_S0	Cost of customer relationships acquired ("CCRA") is established when we purchase a block of insurance.
24090_18_ITEM15_P49_S1	CCRA is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits.
24090_18_ITEM15_P49_S2	Inherent in the amortization of CCRA are certain management judgments about the ending asset balance and the annual amortization.
24090_18_ITEM15_P49_S3	The assumptions used are based upon interest, mortality and lapses at the time of purchase.
24090_18_ITEM15_P50_S0	A recoverability test that considers, among other things, actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually.
24090_18_ITEM15_P50_S1	These annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium (gross premium less the benefit and expense portion of premium) for the next 50 years.
24090_18_ITEM15_P50_S2	The CCRA is then evaluated utilizing reasonable assumptions.
24090_18_ITEM15_P51_S0	December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P51_S1	This belief is based upon the analysis performed on estimated future results of the block and our annual recoverability testing.
24090_18_ITEM15_P52_S0	Cost of customer relationships acquired relative to purchased blocks of insurance is summarized as follows:
24090_18_ITEM15_P53_S0	Estimated amortization of cost of customer relationship acquired in each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows.
24090_18_ITEM15_P53_S1	Actual future amortization will differ from these estimates due to variances from estimated future withdrawal assumptions.
24090_18_ITEM15_P54_S0	The value of CCRA in our various acquisitions, which is included in cost of customer relationships acquired in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, was determined based on the present value of future profits discounted at annual rates ranging from 3.7% to 8.5% .
24090_18_ITEM15_P55_S0	Future policy benefit reserves for traditional life insurance and accident and health insurance contract benefits and expenses are computed using a net level premium method, with assumptions as to investment yields, dividends on participating business, mortality and withdrawals based upon our experience, modified as necessary to reflect anticipated trends and to include provisions for possible unfavorable deviations.
24090_18_ITEM15_P56_S0	The accrued account balance for non-traditional life insurance and investment contracts is computed as deposits net of withdrawals made by the contract holder, plus amounts credited based on contract specifications, less contract fees and charges assessed, plus any additional interest.
24090_18_ITEM15_P57_S0	Annuity interest crediting rates range from 2.5% to 5.5% annually.
24090_18_ITEM15_P57_S1	Benefits and expenses are charged against the account balance to recognize costs as incurred over the estimated lives of the contracts.
24090_18_ITEM15_P57_S2	Expenses include interest credited to contract account balances and benefits paid in excess of contract account balances.
24090_18_ITEM15_P58_S0	Unpaid claims on accident and health and specialty property insurance policies represent the estimated liability for benefit expenses, both reported but not paid and incurred but not reported to the Company.
24090_18_ITEM15_P58_S1	The liability for incurred but not reported claims includes estimates for additional claim amounts due related to reported claims.
24090_18_ITEM15_P58_S2	Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated using individual case basis valuations and statistical analysis.
24090_18_ITEM15_P58_S3	Those estimates are subject to the effects of trends in claim severity and frequency.
24090_18_ITEM15_P59_S0	Anticipated investment income is not considered in determining whether a premium deficiency exists with respect to short-duration contracts.
24090_18_ITEM15_P60_S0	Premium deposits accrue interest at rates ranging from 2.5% to 6.0% per annum.
24090_18_ITEM15_P60_S1	The cost of insurance is included in the premium when collected and interest is credited annually to deposit accounts.
24090_18_ITEM15_P61_S0	The development of liabilities for future policy benefits requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding mortality, morbidity, lapse, expense, and investment experience.
24090_18_ITEM15_P61_S1	These estimates are based primarily on historical experience and future expectations of mortality, morbidity, expense, persistency, and investment assumptions.
24090_18_ITEM15_P61_S2	Actual results could differ materially from estimates.
24090_18_ITEM15_P61_S3	We monitor actual experience and revise assumptions as necessary.
24090_18_ITEM15_P62_S0	Goodwill is the difference between the purchase price in a business combination and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, and is not amortized.
24090_18_ITEM15_P62_S1	Other intangible assets include various state insurance licenses, which have been determined to have indefinite useful lives and, therefore, are not amortized.
24090_18_ITEM15_P62_S2	Both goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are subject to annual impairment analysis.
24090_18_ITEM15_P63_S0	The goodwill impairment test uses a two-step process as set forth under current accounting guidance.
24090_18_ITEM15_P63_S1	In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
24090_18_ITEM15_P63_S2	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment.
24090_18_ITEM15_P63_S3	In the second step, the fair value of projected new business is compared to the carrying value of goodwill.
24090_18_ITEM15_P63_S4	A requirement of this method is that the inforce must pass loss recognition testing.
24090_18_ITEM15_P63_S5	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the fair value of projected new business, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
24090_18_ITEM15_P64_S0	No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairmen t.
24090_18_ITEM15_P64_S1	An entity will no longer perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure impairment, eliminating step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.
24090_18_ITEM15_P64_S2	Instead, impairment will be measured using the difference of the carrying amount to the fair value of the reporting unit.
24090_18_ITEM15_P64_S3	The ASU is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods in fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2019, but early adoption is permitted for goodwill impairment tests with measurement dates after January 1, 2017.
24090_18_ITEM15_P64_S4	The Company elected to early adopt this ASU for our 2017 annual evaluation.
24090_18_ITEM15_P65_S0	Management s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations based on assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit.
24090_18_ITEM15_P65_S1	Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections.
24090_18_ITEM15_P66_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company had goodwill of $12.6 million allocated to the Life Insurance segment.
24090_18_ITEM15_P66_S1	The Company completes its annual goodwill assessment for the individual reporting units within the Life Insurance segment and Home Service Insurance segment as of December 31 each year.
24090_18_ITEM15_P66_S2	We recorded an impairment of $4.6 million in 2017 in our Home Service segment.
24090_18_ITEM15_P66_S3	This impairment is recorded in other general expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
24090_18_ITEM15_P67_S0	We adjusted our discount rate used in our fair value calculation from 10% in 2016 to 12% in 2017 based upon current market inputs as well as decreasing our estimate related to long term investment earned rates from 5.85% in 2016 to 4.95% in 2017 due to the current interest environment.
24090_18_ITEM15_P67_S1	These revisions resulted in decreasing the fair value of this segment.
24090_18_ITEM15_P67_S2	We also estimated lower new business projections in our 2017 valuation based upon the lack of market share growth in this segment.
24090_18_ITEM15_P67_S3	There was no impairment of goodwill in 2016 or 2015 related to the Life or Home Service segment.
24090_18_ITEM15_P68_S0	At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , participating business approximated 62.5% and 62.2% of direct life insurance in force, respectively.
24090_18_ITEM15_P69_S0	Future policy benefits on participating policies are estimated based on net level premium reserves for death and endowment policy benefits with interest rates ranging from 3.2% to 9.0% , and the cash surrender values described in such contracts.
24090_18_ITEM15_P69_S1	The scaling rate used for the 2017 portfolio ranged between 3.19% for 1 year and then going up to 4.45% over 20 years and remaining there for the duration.
24090_18_ITEM15_P70_S0	Earnings and dividends on participating policies are allocated based on policies in force.
24090_18_ITEM15_P71_S0	Policyholder dividends are determined based on the discretion of the Board of Directors of the policy issuing subsidiary.
24090_18_ITEM15_P71_S1	Policyholder dividends are accrued over the premium paying periods of the insurance contract.
24090_18_ITEM15_P72_S0	Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.
24090_18_ITEM15_P72_S1	Diluted earnings per share are computed under the if-converted method for convertible securities and the treasury stock method for warrants, giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock, including options, warrants and convertible/redeemable preferred stock.
24090_18_ITEM15_P72_S2	The basic and diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock are one half the earnings per share of the Class A common stock.
24090_18_ITEM15_P73_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
24090_18_ITEM15_P74_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
24090_18_ITEM15_P74_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered.
24090_18_ITEM15_P75_S0	A deferred tax asset is recorded only if a determination is made that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax treatment on which the deferred tax asset depends will be sustained in the event of an audit.
24090_18_ITEM15_P75_S1	These determinations inherently involve management's judgment.
24090_18_ITEM15_P75_S2	In addition, the Company must record a tax valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
24090_18_ITEM15_P75_S3	This valuation allowance is in essence a contra account to the deferred tax asset.
24090_18_ITEM15_P75_S4	Management must determine the portion of the deferred tax asset and resulting tax benefit that may not be realized based upon judgment of expected outcomes.
24090_18_ITEM15_P76_S0	Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
24090_18_ITEM15_P76_S1	Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to thirty years.
24090_18_ITEM15_P77_S0	The following is a summary of property and equipment.
24090_18_ITEM15_P78_S0	During August 2017, the Company relocated its home office to a different location and entered into a lease with an unrelated party.
24090_18_ITEM15_P78_S1	The Company's previous home office was in a building owned by a Company affiliate.
24090_18_ITEM15_P78_S2	During the fourth quarter of 2017, the building was reclassified in the amount of $1.6 million from property and equipment to real estate held for investment on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, and the Company is currently searching for tenants to lease the office space.
24090_18_ITEM15_P79_S0	Lease payments at the new home office are $114,000 per month during the twelve months beginning August 1, 2017 and increase to $118,000 per month for the second year beginning August 1, 2018.
24090_18_ITEM15_P79_S1	After that, the Company will renegotiate with the landlord for a long term lease.
24090_18_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company sold its airplane in 2017 for a gain of $99,000 , which is included in other income on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
24090_18_ITEM15_P81_S0	Reinsurance recoverable includes expected reimbursements for policyholder claim amounts in excess of the Company's retention, as well as profit sharing and experience refund accruals.
24090_18_ITEM15_P81_S1	Reinsurance recoverable is reduced for estimated uncollectible amounts, if any.
24090_18_ITEM15_P82_S0	Reinsurance premiums, benefits and expenses are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts.
24090_18_ITEM15_P82_S1	The cost of reinsurance related to long duration contracts is accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies.
24090_18_ITEM15_P82_S2	The cost of reinsurance related to short duration contracts is accounted for over the coverage period.
24090_18_ITEM15_P82_S3	Profit-sharing and similar adjustable provisions are accrued based on the experience of the underlying policies.
24090_18_ITEM15_P83_S0	An estimated loss from a contingency is accrued and charged to results of operations only if both of the following conditions are met:
24090_18_ITEM15_P84_S0	Information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable (virtual certainty is not required) that an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred as of the date of the financial statements; and 2.
24090_18_ITEM15_P84_S1	The amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
24090_18_ITEM15_P85_S0	Reasonable estimation of a possible loss does not require estimating a single amount of the loss.
24090_18_ITEM15_P85_S1	It requires that a loss be accrued if it can be estimated within a range.
24090_18_ITEM15_P85_S2	If an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, that amount is accrued.
24090_18_ITEM15_P85_S3	If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
24090_18_ITEM15_P86_S0	A gain contingency is an uncertain situation that will be resolved in the future, possibly resulting in a gain.
24090_18_ITEM15_P86_S1	We do not allow the recognition of a gain contingency prior to settlement of the underlying event.
24090_18_ITEM15_P86_S2	If we were to have a material gain contingency, we would disclose it in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
24090_18_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Company considers cash equivalents as all securities whose duration does not exceed 90 days at the date of acquisition.
24090_18_ITEM15_P88_S0	The Company considers investments maturing within one year at acquisition as short-term.
24090_18_ITEM15_P88_S1	These securities are carried at amortized cost, which approximates market value.
24090_18_ITEM15_P89_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
24090_18_ITEM15_P89_S1	Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
24090_18_ITEM15_P90_S0	Certain amounts presented in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
24090_18_ITEM15_P91_S0	On May 21, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-09, Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts , addressing enhanced disclosure requirements for insurers relating to short-duration insurance contract claims and the unpaid claims liability rollforward for long and short-duration contracts.
24090_18_ITEM15_P91_S1	The disclosures are intended to provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an insurance entity s initial claim estimates and subsequent adjustments to those estimates, the methodologies and judgments used to estimate claims, and the timing, frequency, and severity of claims.
24090_18_ITEM15_P91_S2	The new disclosures required the accumulation and reporting of new and different groupings of claims data than previously reported.
24090_18_ITEM15_P91_S3	For public business entities, the new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
24090_18_ITEM15_P92_S0	No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairmen t.
24090_18_ITEM15_P92_S1	An entity will no longer perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure impairment, eliminating step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.
24090_18_ITEM15_P92_S2	Instead, impairment will be measured using the difference of the carrying amount to the fair value of the reporting unit.
24090_18_ITEM15_P93_S0	beginning after December 15, 2019, but early adoption is permitted for goodwill impairment tests with measurement dates after January 1, 2017.
24090_18_ITEM15_P93_S1	The Company elected to early adopt this ASU for our 2017 annual evaluation.
24090_18_ITEM15_P94_S0	No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.
24090_18_ITEM15_P95_S0	The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
24090_18_ITEM15_P95_S1	The guidance provides a five-step process to achieve that core principle.
24090_18_ITEM15_P96_S0	ASU 2014-09 requires disclosures enabling users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
24090_18_ITEM15_P96_S1	Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.
24090_18_ITEM15_P97_S0	ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, using one of two retrospective application methods.
24090_18_ITEM15_P98_S0	We have evaluated the effect the guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
24090_18_ITEM15_P98_S1	We do not expect that any portion of our revenue will be affected by the new standard, primarily as the new guidance does not apply to revenue from insurance contracts and our non-insurance subsidiaries do not receive revenues from customers.
24090_18_ITEM15_P99_S0	The FASB s new lease accounting standard, ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , was issued on February 25, 2016.
24090_18_ITEM15_P99_S1	The ASU will require organizations that lease assets, referred to as lessees , to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases.
24090_18_ITEM15_P99_S2	The ASU also will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
24090_18_ITEM15_P99_S3	These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements, providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements.
24090_18_ITEM15_P100_S0	The accounting by organizations that own the assets leased by the lessee, also known as lessor accounting, will remain largely unchanged from current U.S. GAAP.
24090_18_ITEM15_P100_S1	However, the ASU contains some targeted improvements that are intended to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and with the updated revenue recognition guidance issued in 2014.
24090_18_ITEM15_P101_S0	The ASU on leases will take effect for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
24090_18_ITEM15_P101_S1	The Company is assessing the impact of this new standard.
24090_18_ITEM15_P102_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) , with the main objective to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date.
24090_18_ITEM15_P102_S1	The amendments in this ASU require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.
24090_18_ITEM15_P103_S0	The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset.
24090_18_ITEM15_P103_S1	The income statement reflects the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period.
24090_18_ITEM15_P103_S2	Credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities should be measured in a manner similar to current U.S. GAAP; however, the credit losses are recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a write-down.
24090_18_ITEM15_P103_S3	This approach is an improvement to current U.S. GAAP because an entity will be able to record reversals of credit losses (in situations in which the estimate of credit losses declines) in current period net income, which in turn should align the income statement recognition of credit losses with the reporting period in which changes occur.
24090_18_ITEM15_P103_S4	Current U.S. GAAP prohibits reflecting those improvements in current-period earnings.
24090_18_ITEM15_P103_S5	For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
24090_18_ITEM15_P103_S6	The Company is evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements, but it is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
24090_18_ITEM15_P104_S0	No. 2017-08, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20).
24090_18_ITEM15_P104_S1	The amendments in this ASU shorten the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium.
24090_18_ITEM15_P104_S2	Specifically, the amendments require the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date.
24090_18_ITEM15_P104_S3	The amendments do not require an accounting change for securities held at a discount; the discount continues to be amortized to maturity.
24090_18_ITEM15_P105_S0	The Company has a large portfolio of callable debt securities purchased at a premium.
24090_18_ITEM15_P105_S1	As such, the Company had already been amortizing the premium to the earliest call date to reduce volatility in earnings by eliminating reporting large realized losses when debt securities are called.
24090_18_ITEM15_P105_S2	For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
24090_18_ITEM15_P106_S0	No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income .
24090_18_ITEM15_P106_S1	It allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
24090_18_ITEM15_P107_S0	The ASU is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
24090_18_ITEM15_P107_S1	Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued.
24090_18_ITEM15_P107_S2	However, the Company has chosen to not early adopt this guidance.
24090_18_ITEM15_P108_S0	No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
24090_18_ITEM15_P109_S0	U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017 is referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("New Tax Act").
24090_18_ITEM15_P109_S1	The New Tax Act made fundamental changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code that impacted the Company.
24090_18_ITEM15_P109_S2	The primary impact on our 2017 financial results was associated with the effect of reducing the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% which required us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities using the lower rate at December 22, 2017, the date of enactment.
24090_18_ITEM15_P109_S3	Other provisions of the New Tax Act that will impact us but are not effective until January 1, 2018, include, but are not limited to: 1) provisions reducing the dividends received deduction; 2) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax ("AMT"); 3) changing the rules regarding use of net operating losses; and 4) changing the way in which tax reserves will be measured.
24090_18_ITEM15_P110_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( the Dodd-Frank Act ) includes a provision to establish a Federal Insurance Office with the primary purpose of collecting information to better understand insurance issues at the federal level and to monitor the extent to which traditional underserved communities and consumers, minorities and low and moderate income persons have access to affordable insurance products.
24090_18_ITEM15_P110_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act also contains provisions affecting financial institutions, credit rating agencies and other commercial and consumer businesses.
24090_18_ITEM15_P110_S2	The Company is monitoring the impact that the presidential administration and Congress will have on this Act.
24090_18_ITEM15_P111_S0	The Company invests primarily in fixed maturity securities, which totaled 89.3% of total investments and cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P111_S1	Holdings in high quality fixed maturity securities rated A or higher by Standard Poor's, Inc. totaled 75.2% of investment holdings in this category, reflecting the conservative investment philosophy of the Company.
24090_18_ITEM15_P112_S0	The cost, gross unrealized gains and losses and fair value of investments in fixed maturities and equity securities, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , are as follows.
24090_18_ITEM15_P113_S0	For fixed maturity and equity security investments that have unrealized losses as of December 31, 2017 , the cost, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer and fair value are as follows.
24090_18_ITEM15_P114_S0	The available-for-sale fixed maturities in a gross unrealized loss position for more than 12 months is primarily related to rises in interest rates which results in lower market prices on fixed maturity securities that have lower coupons than the current market rate.
24090_18_ITEM15_P114_S1	This is interest rate risk and is not a signal of impairment.
24090_18_ITEM15_P114_S2	Management has completed its assessment of other-than-temporary impairment of these securities.
24090_18_ITEM15_P114_S3	Based on our evaluation of the credit worthiness of the issuers and because we do not intend to sell the investments, nor is it likely that we would be required to sell these investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, none of the unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporary.
24090_18_ITEM15_P115_S0	We monitor all debt and equity securities on an on-going basis relative to changes in credit ratings, market prices, earnings trends and financial performance, in addition to specific region or industry reviews.
24090_18_ITEM15_P115_S1	Our impairment review, in accordance with current guidance, is performed by the Company at each reporting date and management uses its best judgment to decide if impairment is other-than-temporary.
24090_18_ITEM15_P115_S2	We determine other-than-temporary impairment by reviewing relevant evidence related to the specific security issuer, as well as our intent to sell the security or whether we more likely than not will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery.
24090_18_ITEM15_P116_S0	All securities with a market price below par were segregated and reviewed as of December 31, 2017 based upon the items above for impairment.
24090_18_ITEM15_P117_S0	For fixed maturity and equity security investments that have unrealized losses as of December 31, 2016 , the cost, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer and fair value are as follows.
24090_18_ITEM15_P118_S0	The amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturities at December 31, 2017 by contractual maturity are shown below.
24090_18_ITEM15_P119_S0	Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
24090_18_ITEM15_P120_S0	Securities not due at a single maturity date have been reflected based upon the final stated maturity.
24090_18_ITEM15_P121_S0	The Company had no investments in any one entity which exceeded 10% of stockholders' equity at December 31, 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P121_S1	In addition, there were no investments that were non-income producing for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P122_S0	Major categories of net investment income are summarized as follows:
24090_18_ITEM15_P123_S0	Proceeds and gross realized gains and losses from sales of fixed maturities available-for-sale for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:
24090_18_ITEM15_P124_S0	In 2017 , SPLIC sold one bond from the available for sale portfolio for cash flow purposes and SPFIC sold three bonds.
24090_18_ITEM15_P124_S1	In 2016, SPLIC sold eleven bonds from their available-for-sale portfolio to generate funds to pay the extraordinary dividend to CICA.
24090_18_ITEM15_P124_S2	These sales produced proceeds of $20.6 million and realized gains of $1.5 million .
24090_18_ITEM15_P124_S3	In 2015, there were no sales of fixed maturities available-for-sale.
24090_18_ITEM15_P124_S4	There were no securities sold from the held-to-maturity portfolio in 2017 , 2016 or 2015 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P125_S0	The Company uses specific identification for securities sold.
24090_18_ITEM15_P126_S0	Proceeds and gross realized gains and losses from sales of equity securities for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:
24090_18_ITEM15_P127_S0	In 2017 , the Company sold one bond mutual fund, which had been previously impaired, that resulted in a net loss of $30,000 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P128_S0	All mutual funds are considered common stocks for regulatory accounting purposes and the RBC charge for stocks is extremely high.
24090_18_ITEM15_P128_S1	In 2016 , five equity and bond mutual funds were sold that resulted in a net gain of $256,000 due to regulatory accounting considerations.
24090_18_ITEM15_P128_S2	During 2015 , six equity and bond mutual funds were sold resulting in a net gain of $35,000 due to circumstances that arose based on the current environment and due to the fact that they were shorter duration funds.
24090_18_ITEM15_P129_S0	Realized investment gains (losses) are as follows:
24090_18_ITEM15_P130_S0	During 2017, the Company sold its Markham building in Little Rock, Arkansas for a gross sales price of $3.25 million , resulting in a gain on sale of $1.1 million .
24090_18_ITEM15_P131_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
24090_18_ITEM15_P131_S1	We hold fixed maturity and equity securities that are carried at fair value.
24090_18_ITEM15_P132_S0	Fair value measurements are generally based upon observable and unobservable inputs.
24090_18_ITEM15_P132_S1	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.
24090_18_ITEM15_P132_S2	We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
24090_18_ITEM15_P133_S0	All assets and liabilities carried at fair value are required to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
24090_18_ITEM15_P134_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
24090_18_ITEM15_P135_S0	Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose inputs or whose significant value drivers are observable.
24090_18_ITEM15_P136_S0	Level 3 - Instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable.
24090_18_ITEM15_P137_S0	Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as U.S. Treasury securities, publicly traded mutual fund investments and individual stocks.
24090_18_ITEM15_P138_S0	Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued by independent pricing services or broker quotes.
24090_18_ITEM15_P138_S1	These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various inputs, such as interest rates, credit spreads and foreign exchange rates for the underlying financial instruments.
24090_18_ITEM15_P138_S2	All significant inputs are observable, or derived from observable information in the marketplace or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
24090_18_ITEM15_P139_S0	Financial instruments in this category primarily include corporate fixed maturity securities, U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise securities, municipal securities and certain mortgage and asset-backed securities.
24090_18_ITEM15_P140_S0	Level 3 is comprised of financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on non-binding broker prices utilizing significant inputs not based on, or corroborated by, readily available market information.
24090_18_ITEM15_P140_S1	We have no level 3 assets as of December 31, 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P141_S0	The following table sets forth our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the date indicated.
24090_18_ITEM15_P142_S0	At December 31, 2017 , the fixed maturities, valued using a third-party pricing source, totaled $962.8 million for Level 2 assets and comprised 97.2% of total reported fair value.
24090_18_ITEM15_P142_S1	Fair values for Level 3 assets are based upon unadjusted broker quotes that are non-binding.
24090_18_ITEM15_P143_S0	The Level 1 and Level 2 valuations are reviewed and validated quarterly through random testing by comparisons to separate pricing models, other third party pricing services, and back tested to recent trades.
24090_18_ITEM15_P143_S1	In addition, we obtain information relative to the third party pricing models and review model parameters for reasonableness.
24090_18_ITEM15_P143_S2	For the period ended December 31, 2017 , there were no material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine fair values, and no broker or third party prices were changed from the values received.
24090_18_ITEM15_P144_S0	There were no transfers made between Levels 1 and 2 securities at December 31, 2017 or 2016 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P145_S0	Fair values of these securities are based upon quoted market price and are classified as Level 1 assets.
24090_18_ITEM15_P146_S0	The following table presents additional information about fixed maturity securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and for which we have utilized significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs to determine fair value:
24090_18_ITEM15_P147_S0	We review the fair value hierarchy classifications each reporting period.
24090_18_ITEM15_P148_S0	Changes in the observability of the valuation attributes may result in a reclassification of certain financial assets.
24090_18_ITEM15_P148_S1	Such reclassifications, if any, are reported as transfers in and out of Level 3 at the beginning fair value for the reporting period in which the changes occur.
24090_18_ITEM15_P149_S0	Estimates of fair values are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market prices and information about the financial instrument.
24090_18_ITEM15_P149_S1	The estimated fair values of financial instruments presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company might realize in actual market transactions.
24090_18_ITEM15_P149_S2	The carrying amount and fair value for the financial assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at each year-end were as follows:
24090_18_ITEM15_P150_S0	Fair values for fixed income securities, which are characterized as Level 2 assets in the fair value hierarchy, are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar securities.
24090_18_ITEM15_P150_S1	In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other assumptions, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.
24090_18_ITEM15_P151_S0	Mortgage loans are secured principally by residential properties and commercial properties.
24090_18_ITEM15_P151_S1	Weighted average interest rates for these loans were approximately 6.6% and 6.8% per year, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, with maturities ranging from 21 to 25 years.
24090_18_ITEM15_P151_S2	Management estimated the fair value using an annual interest rate of 6.25% at December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P151_S3	Our mortgage loans are considered Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_18_ITEM15_P152_S0	Policy loans have a weighted average annual interest rate of 7.7% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and have no specified maturity dates.
24090_18_ITEM15_P152_S1	The aggregate fair value of policy loans approximates the carrying value reflected on the consolidated balance sheet.
24090_18_ITEM15_P152_S2	These loans typically carry an interest rate that is tied to the crediting rate applied to the related policy and contract reserves.
24090_18_ITEM15_P153_S0	Policy loans are an integral part of the life insurance policies that we have in force and cannot be valued separately and are not marketable.
24090_18_ITEM15_P153_S1	Therefore, the fair value approximates the carrying value and policy loans are considered Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_18_ITEM15_P154_S0	The fair value of short-term investments approximate carrying value due to their short-term nature.
24090_18_ITEM15_P154_S1	Our short-term investments are considered Level 2 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_18_ITEM15_P155_S0	The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximate carrying value and are characterized as Level 1 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
24090_18_ITEM15_P156_S0	The fair value of the Company's liabilities under annuity contract policies, which are considered Level 3 instruments, was estimated at December 31, 2017 using discounted cash flows based upon a swap rate curve with interest rates ranging from 1.84% to 3.34% based upon swap rates adjusted for various risk adjustments.
24090_18_ITEM15_P156_S1	The fair value of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in the overall management of interest rate risk, which seeks to minimize exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment maturities with amounts due under insurance contracts.
24090_18_ITEM15_P157_S0	Various assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit reserves of life insurance include the following: a) valuation interest rates; b) mortality assumptions; and c) withdrawals.
24090_18_ITEM15_P158_S0	The following table presents information on changes in the liability for life, accident and health and property policy and contract claims for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P159_S0	The Company experienced favorable development in 2017 of $209,000 and favorable development in 2016 of $493,000 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P159_S1	No unusual claims or trends have been noted.
24090_18_ITEM15_P160_S0	The Company's short duration contracts consist of credit life and credit disability in the Life segment and property insurance in the Home Service segment.
24090_18_ITEM15_P160_S1	The credit insurance lines are an immaterial part of short duration contracts so the following disclosures cover only the property insurance line of business in the Home Service segment.
24090_18_ITEM15_P161_S0	The following table presents incurred claims development as of December 31, 2017 , net of reinsurance, as well as cumulative claim frequency and the total of incurred-but-not-reported liabilities plus expected development on reported claims included within the net incurred claims amounts.
24090_18_ITEM15_P161_S1	This information is presented for the last five years as these claims rarely pay out over a longer period of time.
24090_18_ITEM15_P161_S2	Claims data for 2013 through 2015 is supplementary information to the consolidated financial statements and is unaudited.
24090_18_ITEM15_P162_S0	The following table presents paid claims development as of December 31, 2017 , net of reinsurance.
24090_18_ITEM15_P162_S1	Claims data for 2013 through 2015 are unaudited.
24090_18_ITEM15_P163_S0	The reconciliation of the net incurred and paid claims development tables to the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses in the consolidated statement of financial position is as follows.
24090_18_ITEM15_P164_S0	The following is supplementary information to the consolidated financial statements about average historical claims duration as of December 31, 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P165_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company reinsures portions of certain policies that we underwrite to limit disproportionate risks.
24090_18_ITEM15_P165_S1	During 2017 and 2016 , we retained varying amounts of individual insurance up to a maximum retention of $100,000 on any life.
24090_18_ITEM15_P165_S2	The Company also reinsures 100% of our accidental death benefit rider coverage.
24090_18_ITEM15_P165_S3	Catastrophe reinsurance is in place for our property policies.
24090_18_ITEM15_P165_S4	In 2017 and 2016 , this reinsurance provided $10,000,000 of coverage above a $500,000 deductible.
24090_18_ITEM15_P166_S0	Our health insurance policies are substantially all reinsured on a 100% coinsurance basis.
24090_18_ITEM15_P166_S1	We remain contingently liable to the extent that the reinsuring companies cannot meet their obligations under these reinsurance treaties.
24090_18_ITEM15_P167_S0	Our amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and reserves ceded to reinsurers.
24090_18_ITEM15_P167_S1	We obtain reinsurance from multiple reinsurers, and we monitor concentration as well as financial strength ratings of our principal reinsurers.
24090_18_ITEM15_P167_S2	The ratings by A.M. Best Company range from A+ (Superior) to B+ (Good).
24090_18_ITEM15_P168_S0	To protect our position, we have established and funded a trust to cover the contingent liabilities related to accident and health reinsurance ceded to Unified Life Insurance Company, which represents $27,000 of the $3.7 million of reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P169_S0	Assumed and ceded life reinsurance activity as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized as follows:
24090_18_ITEM15_P170_S0	The Company's reinsurance recoveries on ceded reinsurance were $3.7 million in 2017 and $3.9 million in 2016 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P170_S1	Premiums, claims and surrenders assumed and ceded for all lines of business for these years are summarized as follows:
24090_18_ITEM15_P171_S0	SPFIC has catastrophe reinsurance that covers the first event in excess of a $500,000 deductible up to $10.0 million .
24090_18_ITEM15_P171_S1	In consideration for a reinstatement premium, second event coverage is provided in excess of a $500,000 deductible up to $10.0 million .
24090_18_ITEM15_P171_S2	The annual premium was approximately $0.8 million in 2017 and 2016 and $0.9 million in 2015 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P172_S0	The two classes of our common stock are equal in all respects, except (a) each Class A share is entitled to receive twice the cash dividends paid on a per share basis to the Class B common stock, if any; and (b) the Class B common stock has the exclusive right to elect a simple majority of the Board of Directors of Citizens and the Class A common stock elects the remaining directors.
24090_18_ITEM15_P173_S0	The table below shows the combined total of all of our insurance subsidiaries' capital and surplus and net income (loss) for life insurance operations and property insurance operations, although these amounts are not all available as dividends to Citizens, Inc., because only CICA is directly owned by Citizens, Inc.
24090_18_ITEM15_P173_S1	All other subsidiaries are owned by CICA.
24090_18_ITEM15_P174_S0	Generally, the net assets of the insurance subsidiaries available for transfer to their immediate parent are limited to the greater of the subsidiary net gain from operations during the preceding year or 10% of the subsidiary net statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities.
24090_18_ITEM15_P174_S1	Under these practices, total surplus at December 31, 2017 was $32.0 million and net gain from operations was $5.8 million for CICA.
24090_18_ITEM15_P174_S2	Based upon statutory net gain from operations and surplus of CICA as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 , a dividend of approximately $5.8 million could be paid to the Company without prior regulatory approval in 2018 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P174_S3	Payments of dividends in excess of such amounts would generally require approval by regulatory authorities.
24090_18_ITEM15_P175_S0	CICA, CNLIC, SPLIC, MGLIC and SPFIC have calculated their risk based capital ("RBC") in accordance with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' Model Rule and the RBC rules as adopted by their respective states of domicile.
24090_18_ITEM15_P175_S1	All insurance subsidiaries exceeded RBC minimum levels at December 31, 2017 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P176_S0	On June 10, 2016, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) Executive Committee and Plenary voted to adopt a recommendation for January 1, 2017 as the operative date for the implementation of Principles-Based Reserves ( PBR ) as a national standard for life insurance products.
24090_18_ITEM15_P176_S1	Although this NAIC standard does not change the reserving requirements under U.S. GAAP, it can be significant for many life insurers.
24090_18_ITEM15_P177_S0	PBR replaces the current formulaic approach to determining policy reserves with an approach that more closely reflects the risks of highly complex products.
24090_18_ITEM15_P177_S1	Companies will be expected to develop right-sized reserves that better align with their specific product features, their observed actuarial experience, and their overall risk management procedures.
24090_18_ITEM15_P177_S2	There is a three-year transition period where PBR is optional until PBR becomes required on January 1, 2020.
24090_18_ITEM15_P177_S3	The Company is assessing the impact that this standard will have on its statutory reserving and capital and surplus.
24090_18_ITEM15_P178_S0	As of December 31, 2014, we reported that a portion of the life insurance policies issued by our subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") of 1986.
24090_18_ITEM15_P178_S1	This tax code section allows for qualifying products sold to clients to have favorable tax treatment such as the product's inside build up is not taxable, unless distributions are made.
24090_18_ITEM15_P178_S2	Because these policies were sold with the intention that they would qualify for this favorable tax treatment, holders of these policies and the Company may now be subject to additional tax liabilities.
24090_18_ITEM15_P179_S0	The policies at issue were sold most substantially to non-U.S. citizens residing abroad and to a lesser extent domestically.
24090_18_ITEM15_P179_S1	Based upon a review of the options available to the Company, we have determined we will not remediate our endowments and life products that we have sold to non-U.S. citizens but will propose an offer to the IRS to settle potential liabilities.
24090_18_ITEM15_P179_S2	We do intend to remediate the domestic products we have sold to U.S. citizens.
24090_18_ITEM15_P179_S3	Accordingly, we submitted an offer to enter into a Closing Agreement for CICA and CNLIC in May 2017.
24090_18_ITEM15_P179_S4	We have not received a response from the IRS on this submission.
24090_18_ITEM15_P179_S5	In addition, as part of our continuing review, we determined in July 2015 that certain annuity contracts do not contain qualifying language under IRC 72(s) as intended that would have provided for favorable tax treatment of the annuities.
24090_18_ITEM15_P179_S6	This issue affects both our domestic and international contract holders.
24090_18_ITEM15_P179_S7	We generally endorsed affected domestic annuity contracts to comply with the Code in December 2017 and intend to submit a Closing Agreement offer in 2018 to address past non-compliance.
24090_18_ITEM15_P179_S8	The Company has continued to refine the understanding of the tax failures as previously reported by preparing an individual policy calculation and has reflected the related exposure for the current reporting period as noted below.
24090_18_ITEM15_P179_S9	Failure of these policies to qualify under IRC Sections 7702 and 72(s) has resulted in additional liabilities and expenses as described below.
24090_18_ITEM15_P180_S0	The products have been and continue to be appropriately reported under U.S. GAAP for financial reporting.
24090_18_ITEM15_P181_S0	The failure of these policies to qualify under Sections 7702 and 72(s) results in an estimated liability as of December 31, 2017 of $12.3 million, after tax, related to projected IRS toll charges and fees of $12.0 million and reserves increases to bring policies into compliance totaling $0.3 million.
24090_18_ITEM15_P181_S1	The estimated liability at December 31, 2017 is down $2.1 million from the estimated liability at December 31, 2016 of $14.4 million , after tax, due to a continued refinement of our estimate and additional accrued interest charges.
24090_18_ITEM15_P181_S2	The probability weighted range of financial estimates relative to this issue is $5.9 million to $48.2 million , after tax.
24090_18_ITEM15_P181_S3	This estimated range includes projected toll charges and fees payable to the IRS, as well as estimated increased payout obligations to current holders of non-compliant domestic life insurance policies expected to result from remediation of those policies.
24090_18_ITEM15_P181_S4	The estimated liability and the estimated range will be updated as we continue to refine our estimates.
24090_18_ITEM15_P181_S5	The amount of our liabilities and expenses depends on a number of uncertainties, including the number of prior tax years for which we may be liable to the IRS, the number of domestic life insurance policies we will be required to remediate, and the methodology applicable to the calculation of the toll charge for non-compliant policies.
24090_18_ITEM15_P181_S6	Given the range of potential outcomes and the significant variables assumed in establishing our estimates, actual amounts incurred may exceed our reserve and also could exceed the high end of our estimated range of liabilities and expenses.
24090_18_ITEM15_P181_S7	To the extent the amount reserved by the Company is insufficient to meet the actual amount of our liability and expenses, or if our estimates of those liabilities and expenses change in the future, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
24090_18_ITEM15_P181_S8	Management believes that based upon current information we have recorded the best estimate liability to date.
24090_18_ITEM15_P182_S0	Accruals for loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
24090_18_ITEM15_P182_S1	The process of determining our best estimate and the estimated range was a complex undertaking including insight from external consultants and involved management s judgment based upon a variety of factors known at the time.
24090_18_ITEM15_P182_S2	Additional costs will be incurred in 2018 associated with these issues and we believe these costs will range from $1.0 million to $2.0 million , but due to the uncertainty of actions we cannot reasonably estimate these costs with any reliability.
24090_18_ITEM15_P182_S3	Actual amounts incurred may exceed this estimate and will be recorded as they become probable and can be reasonably estimated.
24090_18_ITEM15_P183_S0	On or about March 16, 2017, Juan Gamboa filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and five of its current and former directors and executive officers in the United States District Court, Western District of Texas.
24090_18_ITEM15_P183_S1	The lawsuit alleges the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by making false and/or misleading statements, as well as failing to disclose material adverse facts about the Company s business, operations and prospects.
24090_18_ITEM15_P184_S0	on July 31, 2017, the lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.
24090_18_ITEM15_P184_S1	The amended complaint seeks an award of damages in an unspecified amount on behalf of a putative class consisting of persons who purchased the Company s common stock between March 11, 2015 and March 8, 2017, inclusive.
24090_18_ITEM15_P184_S2	On September 28, 2017, we filed a motion to dismiss, which remains pending before the court.
24090_18_ITEM15_P184_S3	The Company believes that the lawsuit is without merit, and it intends to vigorously defend against all claims asserted.
24090_18_ITEM15_P184_S4	At this time, the Company is unable to reasonably determine the outcome of this litigation.
24090_18_ITEM15_P185_S0	From time to time we are subject to legal and regulatory actions relating to our business.
24090_18_ITEM15_P185_S1	As a result, we incur defense costs, including attorneys' fees, other direct litigation costs and the expenditure of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.
24090_18_ITEM15_P185_S2	If we suffer an adverse judgment as a result of litigation claims, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
24090_18_ITEM15_P186_S0	As disclosed in prior periods, the legal and regulatory actions facing the company include those relating to compliance with U.S. federal securities laws.
24090_18_ITEM15_P186_S1	Specifically, the Company has been the subject of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), which appears to be focused on the Company s internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures in light of the Company s determination in 2015 that a portion of the life insurance and annuity policies issued by its subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702 and 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
24090_18_ITEM15_P186_S2	There have been no allegations of fraud presented by the SEC.
24090_18_ITEM15_P186_S3	We have cooperated fully with the investigation and expect that the matter will be resolved soon, although we cannot predict the timing of a resolution or the ultimate outcome of the investigation.
24090_18_ITEM15_P186_S4	The Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that resolution of this matter could result in a material loss to the Company.
24090_18_ITEM15_P187_S0	Unclaimed Property Contingencies The Company was informed in 2012 by the Louisiana Department of Treasury, Arkansas Auditor of State and the Texas State Comptroller, that they authorized an audit of Citizens, Inc. and its affiliates for compliance with unclaimed property laws.
24090_18_ITEM15_P187_S1	This audit is being conducted by Verus Financial LLC on behalf of the states.
24090_18_ITEM15_P187_S2	This audit is not an active audit and there has been no activity relative to this audit for several years.
24090_18_ITEM15_P188_S0	If the external audit was performed it could result in additional payments to beneficiaries, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws, administrative penalties, interest, and changes to the Company's procedures for the identification and escheatment of abandoned property.
24090_18_ITEM15_P188_S1	The Company believes additional escheatment of funds in Arkansas or Texas will not be material to our financial condition or results of operations.
24090_18_ITEM15_P188_S2	However, additional escheatment of funds in Louisiana, which may subsequently be deemed abandoned under the Louisiana Department of Treasury s audit, could be substantial for SPLIC if the Louisiana Department of Treasury chooses to disregard recent court decisions regarding unclaimed property litigation in favor of the insurance industry.
24090_18_ITEM15_P188_S3	At this time, the Company is not able to estimate any of these possible amounts.
24090_18_ITEM15_P189_S0	We have the following operating lease commitments as of December 31, 2017 with the payments due by the periods indicated below.
24090_18_ITEM15_P190_S0	Operating lease expense was $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P191_S0	The Company has two reportable segments: Life Insurance and Home Service Insurance.
24090_18_ITEM15_P192_S0	The Life Insurance and Home Service portions of the Company constitute separate businesses.
24090_18_ITEM15_P192_S1	In addition to the Life Insurance and Home Service business, the Company also operates other non-insurance portions of the Company, which primarily includes the Company s IT and Corporate-support functions, which is included in the table presentation below to properly reconcile the segment information with consolidated financial statements of the Company.
24090_18_ITEM15_P193_S0	The accounting policies of the segments are in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are the same as those described in the summary of significant account policies.
24090_18_ITEM15_P194_S0	We evaluate profit and loss performance based on U.S. GAAP net income before federal income taxes for our reportable segments.
24090_18_ITEM15_P195_S0	The Company's Other Non-insurance operations is the only difference between segments and reported consolidated operations.
24090_18_ITEM15_P196_S0	The table below summarizes assets by segment.
24090_18_ITEM15_P197_S0	Major categories of earned premiums are summarized as follows:
24090_18_ITEM15_P198_S0	The following table sets forth the Company's annual total of earned premiums from geographic area for the years indicated:
24090_18_ITEM15_P199_S0	Due to the reduced statutory tax rate under the New Tax Act, we were required to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities using the lower rate at December 22, 2017, the date of enactment.
24090_18_ITEM15_P199_S1	This re-measurement resulted in a reduction of net deferred tax assets of $35.7 million , which includes a $4.8 million benefit related to deferred taxes previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.
24090_18_ITEM15_P200_S0	No. 118 ("SAB 118"), the Company has recorded provisional amounts related to the impacts of the New Tax Act, including but not limited to the change in corporate tax rate and immediate expensing of certain capital assets.
24090_18_ITEM15_P200_S1	The amounts are considered provisional estimates due to complexities and ambiguities in New Tax Act which resulted in incomplete accounting for the tax effects of these provisions.
24090_18_ITEM15_P200_S2	Further guidance, either legislative or interpretive, and analysis will be required to complete the accounting for these items.
24090_18_ITEM15_P200_S3	A final determination is required to be made within a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date of the New Tax Act.
24090_18_ITEM15_P200_S4	No other provisions of the New Tax Act had a significant impact on our 2017 income tax provisions.
24090_18_ITEM15_P201_S0	Our federal income tax expense was $35.1 million , $3.5 million and $1.2 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
24090_18_ITEM15_P201_S1	This represents effective tax rates of (1,176.9)% , 64.1% and (61.8)% , respectively.
24090_18_ITEM15_P201_S2	The high negative effective tax rate in 2017 was primarily related to remeasurement under the New Tax Act reform which went into effect on December 22, 2017.
24090_18_ITEM15_P201_S3	The high effective rate in 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to the effect of our uncertain tax position and the nondeductible costs to remediate our tax compliance issues.
24090_18_ITEM15_P202_S0	The Company holds no valuation allowance in other comprehensive income at December 31, 2017 or 2016 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P203_S0	A reconciliation of federal income tax expense computed by applying the federal income tax rate of 35% in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 to income (loss) before federal income tax expense is as follows:
24090_18_ITEM15_P204_S0	The components of deferred federal income taxes are as follows:
24090_18_ITEM15_P205_S0	A summary of the changes in the components of deferred federal and state income taxes is as follows:
24090_18_ITEM15_P206_S0	MGLIC, who is not eligible to join the Company's consolidated tax return until 2020, had a $1.2 million net operating loss carryforward at December 31, 2017 , which begin expiring in 2032 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P207_S0	The Company and our subsidiaries had $1.1 million of capital loss carryforwards at December 31, 2017 , which will expire, if unused, in 2022 .
24090_18_ITEM15_P208_S0	At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we determined that as a result of our taxable income in carryback periods, tax planning strategies, and the expected reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized.
24090_18_ITEM15_P209_S0	The Company recognizes only the impact of tax positions that, based on their technical merits, are more likely than not to be sustained upon an audit by the taxing authority.
24090_18_ITEM15_P210_S0	A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
24090_18_ITEM15_P211_S0	This unrecognized tax benefit is reported net in current federal income tax payable in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
24090_18_ITEM15_P211_S1	Included in these amounts is $6.5 million , $5.7 million and $3.5 million of interest expense with respect to unrecognized tax benefit as of December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
24090_18_ITEM15_P212_S0	None of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017 would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.
24090_18_ITEM15_P212_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable possibility the total amount of uncertain tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the next twelve months.
24090_18_ITEM15_P213_S0	The Company s practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
24090_18_ITEM15_P213_S1	In the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), the amount of interest expense recorded was $0.8 million , $2.2 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

24090_18_ITEM15_P221_S0	The Company sponsors a defined contribution profit-sharing plan.

24090_18_ITEM15_P221_S4	The plan does not permit employee contributions.
24090_18_ITEM15_P222_S0	The Company introduced an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan to all eligible employees, effective March 1, 2016.
24090_18_ITEM15_P222_S1	This is an additional benefit offered to employees, which supplements the defined contribution profit-sharing plan which was already in existence.
24090_18_ITEM15_P222_S2	Employees with one year of service can participate in the new plan.
24090_18_ITEM15_P222_S3	Contributions are made by employees and the Company provides a matching contribution based upon the employee's level of contribution.
24090_18_ITEM15_P222_S4	The Company's expense related to the new 401(k) plan was $0.7 million and $0.5 million in 2017 and 2016 , respectively.

24090_18_ITEM15_P222_S6	401(k) Retirement and Profit Sharing Plan.
24090_18_ITEM15_P222_S7	Although merged, the profit sharing plan remains a separate and distinct employee benefit for eligible employees.

24090_18_ITEM15_P223_S1	The Company records its self-insurance liability based on an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.
24090_18_ITEM15_P223_S2	There is stop-loss coverage for amounts in excess of $100,000 per individual per year.

24090_18_ITEM15_P229_S0	Correction of Immaterial Errors In the course of preparing its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company identified immaterial errors in its previously filed financial statements.
24090_18_ITEM15_P229_S1	The errors were in the Company s accounting for DAC and future policy benefits in the life insurance segment and several other immaterial errors in our other two segments.
24090_18_ITEM15_P229_S2	Two of the errors were discovered in connection with the Company s ongoing conversion of its actuarial valuation from a third party service provider to an actuarial valuation modeling software system purchased from a vendor.
24090_18_ITEM15_P229_S3	The errors in valuing DAC and future policy benefits caused the Company to understate amortization of DAC over several years and to overstate the increase in future policy benefit reserves during the same periods, resulting in an overstatement of DAC of $0.3 million and an overstatement of future policy benefits of $7.9 million at December 31, 2015.
24090_18_ITEM15_P229_S4	There were several other immaterial errors that resulted in negligible impact at December 31, 2015.
24090_18_ITEM15_P229_S5	Correcting the errors resulted in a reduction in the Company s net losses of $0.4 million in 2015.
24090_18_ITEM15_P230_S0	No. 99, Materiality , and SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements and determined that the errors were immaterial to each of the previously reported periods.
24090_18_ITEM15_P230_S1	However, the Company determined that the adjustment to correct the error, if recorded in 2016 operating results, would materially misstate the 2016 financial statements.
24090_18_ITEM15_P230_S2	Accordingly, we are correcting the errors by restating the prior period information, and therefore have revised the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2015, the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2015.
24090_18_ITEM15_P231_S0	The line item effects of these immaterial error corrections are detailed below.

24090_18_ITEM15_P251_S0	(f) Settlement of RSUs shall be contingent on the making appropriate arrangements for payment of amounts required to be withheld for federal, state and local income and wage taxes, or on the Company exercising its right to withhold Shares that are otherwise to be delivered on settlement of RSUs or to withhold amounts from other compensation payable to the Grantee so as to enable the Company to comply with its withholding obligations.
24090_18_ITEM15_P252_S0	Any cancellation or withholding of RSUs in connection with the Company s withholding obligations shall be deemed to be a taxable distribution of Shares corresponding to the cancelled or withheld RSUs and a repurchase of such Shares for federal income tax purposes at the time that occurs.
24090_18_ITEM15_P252_S1	The foregoing deemed distribution and repurchase of Shares need not be implemented, and a net issuance of Shares shall be permitted; provided, however, that the tax treatment shall be based on the deemed transaction described.
24090_18_ITEM15_P253_S0	In the event any dividends are paid to shareholders during the period following the Grant Date and up to the delivery of any Shares, the Grantee shall be entitled to a payment, at the same time the Shares are delivered to the Grantee, equal to the amount that would have been paid as dividends to the Grantee had the Grantee held the Shares during that period ( Dividend Equivalents ).

24090_18_ITEM15_P253_S2	The Committee shall have the right to determine whether the Dividend Equivalents shall be paid in cash or in the form of a distribution of additional shares of Common Stock having the same value and to determine whether to deem such dividends to have been reinvested in shares at the time the dividends were paid.
24090_18_ITEM15_P254_S0	The effectiveness of this RSU Award granted hereunder is conditioned upon (i) the Grantee s having executed and delivered to the Company in connection with previous RSU grants a restrictive covenant, or (ii) the execution and delivery by the Grantee within 6 months from the date of this RSU Award of the restrictive covenant attached hereto as Exhibit A. If the Company does not receive the signed (whether electronically or otherwise) restrictive covenant within such six-month period, this RSU Award shall be terminable by the Company.
24090_18_ITEM15_P255_S0	This RSU Award is subject to the Compensation Recovery provisions of the Plan the event the Company is required to provide an accounting restatement for any of the prior three fiscal years of the Company for which audited financial statements have been completed as a result of material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under federal securities laws (a Restatement ), the amount of any Excess Compensation (as defined below) realized by an any Executive Officer (as defined below) shall be subject to recovery by the Company.

24090_18_ITEM15_P258_S1	As a consequence, the RSUs do not constitute property for purposes of Code Section 83.
24090_18_ITEM15_P258_S2	As a consequence, the Grantee will be taxable for federal income tax purposes on the value of the Shares distributed to the Grantee at the time the Shares are distributed, and not at the time the RSUs vest.
24090_18_ITEM15_P258_S3	Because the taxable distribution of Shares will always be within the applicable 2 month period (as that phrase is used for purposes of the short-term deferral exemption from Code Section 409A found in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), the RSUs do not create a nonqualified deferred compensation plan and the compensation associated with the RSUs is not intended to be subject to Code Section 409A. All requirements of the aforementioned exemption form Code Section 409A are intended to be met, and this Award Document shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the Company s intent to satisfy such exemption requirements.
24090_18_ITEM15_P259_S0	Any right of the Company contained in this Agreement may be waived in writing by the Committee.
24090_18_ITEM15_P259_S1	No waiver of any right hereunder by any party shall operate as a waiver of any other right, or as a waiver of the same right with respect to any subsequent occasion for its exercise, or as a waiver of any right to damages.

24090_18_ITEM15_P262_S0	The terms of this Award Document shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Company, its successors and assigns, the Grantee and the beneficiaries, executors, administrators and heirs of the Grantee.

24090_18_ITEM15_P295_S0	In the event the Grantee s service with the Company terminates by reason of the Grantee s death or Disability, all outstanding RSUs shall immediately become vested.
24090_18_ITEM15_P296_S0	In the event the Grantee s service with the Company is terminated without Cause (as defined in the Plan), the RSUs that have not previously become vested shall become vested on a pro-rata basis, calculated by reference to the number of completed months of service from the most recent Vesting Date (or Grant Date, as the case may be) as a fraction of the number of months that make up the period from the most recent Vesting Date (or Grant Date) through the next Vesting Date.
24090_18_ITEM15_P297_S0	In the event the Grantee s service terminates by reason of a Termination of Employment or Service in Connection with a Change of Control (as defined in the Plan), all outstanding RSUs shall immediately become vested.

24090_18_ITEM15_P300_S0	(e) No Rights as a Stockholder.
24090_18_ITEM15_P300_S1	The Grantee shall not have any rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to any shares of Common Stock corresponding to the RSUs granted hereby unless and until shares of Common Stock are issued to the Grantee in respect thereof.
24090_18_ITEM15_P301_S0	(f) Settlement of RSUs shall be contingent on making appropriate arrangements for payment of amounts required to be withheld for federal, state and local income and wage taxes, or on the Company exercising its right to withhold Shares that are otherwise to be delivered on settlement of RSUs or to withhold amounts from other compensation payable to the Grantee so as to enable the Company to comply with its withholding obligations.
24090_18_ITEM15_P302_S0	Any cancellation or withholding of RSUs in connection with the Company s withholding obligations shall be deemed to be a taxable distribution of Shares corresponding to the cancelled or withheld RSUs and a repurchase of such Shares for federal income tax purposes at the time that occurs.
24090_18_ITEM15_P302_S1	The foregoing deemed distribution and repurchase of Shares need not be implemented, and a net issuance of Shares shall be permitted; provided, however, that the tax treatment shall be based on the deemed transaction described.
24090_18_ITEM15_P303_S0	In the event any dividends are paid to shareholders during the period following the Grant Date and up to the delivery of any Shares, the Grantee shall be entitled to a payment, at the same time the Shares are delivered to the Grantee, equal to the amount that would have been paid as dividends to the Grantee had the Grantee held the Shares during that period ( Dividend Equivalents ).

24090_18_ITEM15_P303_S2	The Committee shall have the right to determine whether the Dividend Equivalents shall be paid in cash or in the form of a distribution of additional shares of Common Stock having the same value and to determine whether to deem such dividends to have been reinvested in shares at the time the dividends were paid.
24090_18_ITEM15_P304_S0	This RSU Award is subject to the Compensation Recovery provisions of the Plan the event the Company is required to provide an accounting restatement for any of the prior three fiscal years of the Company for which audited financial statements have been completed as a result of material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under federal securities laws (a Restatement ), the amount of any Excess Compensation (as defined below) realized by an any Executive Officer (as defined below) shall be subject to recovery by the Company.
24090_18_ITEM15_P305_S0	The granting and delivery of the RSU Award and any other obligations of the Company under this Award Document, shall be subject to all applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations and to such approvals by any regulatory or governmental agency as may be required.
24090_18_ITEM15_P306_S0	The RSU Award may not be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by a Grantee other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and any such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against the Company or any Affiliate.
24090_18_ITEM15_P307_S0	The RSUs subject to this Award Document are only a contractual right of the Grantee potentially to receive Shares corresponding to the number of RSUs granted to the Grantee.
24090_18_ITEM15_P307_S1	As a consequence, the RSUs do not constitute property for purposes of Code Section 83.
24090_18_ITEM15_P307_S2	As a consequence, the Grantee will be taxable for federal income tax purposes on the value of the Shares distributed to the Grantee at the time the Shares are distributed, and not at the time the RSUs vest.
24090_18_ITEM15_P307_S3	Because the taxable distribution of Shares will always be within the applicable 2 month period (as that phrase is used for purposes of the short-term deferral exemption from Code Section 409A found in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), the RSUs do not create a nonqualified deferred compensation plan and the compensation associated with the RSUs is not intended to be subject to Code Section 409A. All requirements of the aforementioned exemption form Code Section 409A are intended to be met, and this Award Document shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the Company s intent to satisfy such exemption requirements.
24090_18_ITEM15_P308_S0	Any right of the Company contained in this Agreement may be waived in writing by the Committee.
24090_18_ITEM15_P308_S1	No waiver of any right hereunder by any party shall operate as a waiver of any other right, or as a waiver of the same right with respect to any subsequent occasion for its exercise, or as a waiver of any right to damages.
24090_18_ITEM15_P309_S0	The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Award Document shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Award Document, and each other provision of this Agreement shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law.
24090_18_ITEM15_P310_S0	Nothing in the Plan or in this Award Document shall be construed to imply or to constitute evidence of any agreement, express or implied, on the part of the Company to retain the Grantee as a member of the Company s Board of Directors or in any other capacity.
