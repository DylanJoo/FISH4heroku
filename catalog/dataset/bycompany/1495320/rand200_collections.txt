1495320_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	These initiatives were designed to strengthen and enhance our business and operating model, expand our demographic and geographic market opportunity, and position us for future growth.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	The core components of these initiatives included the following: Merchandising Strategy .
1495320_11_ITEM1_P17_S3	To appeal to a broader range of consumers, we developed a mix of pattern and product offerings specifically targeted at different consumer demographics, refined our product release strategy to significantly expand our product portfolio, and increased the number of new patterns released as well as the frequency of new product launches.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P17_S4	In addition, we substantially enhanced our visual merchandising strategy, focusing on a consistent presentation of Vera Bradley as a lifestyle brand.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	In 2006, we initiated a Direct channel strategy that was designed to expand our brand presence and broaden our consumer demographic while complementing the growing Indirect channel of our business.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	The first step in establishing the Direct channel of our business was selling directly to consumers through verabradley.com beginning in 2006.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	In mid-September 2007, we opened our first full-price store.

1495320_11_ITEM1_P18_S5	During this period, we shifted our production from a primarily domestic manufacturing model to a more cost-effective global sourcing platform.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P18_S6	In 2007, we opened a state-of-the-art warehouse and distribution facility in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P18_S7	Our Brand Over 29 years, we have created, developed, and solidified a true lifestyle brand that resonates with a broad range of female consumers.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P18_S8	Our brand vision is accessible luxury that inspires a casual, fun, and family-oriented lifestyle.

1495320_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	The current management team has been instrumental in the development and execution of our long-term strategies.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	We believe there are significant opportunities to expand our business and increase our net revenues and net income through the execution of the following growth strategies: Grow in Underpenetrated Markets.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P25_S3	Our historic growth focused primarily on the eastern United States, and accordingly, the Vera Bradley brand is most recognized in that region.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P25_S4	In recent years, we have successfully expanded our Indirect and Direct channels in key developing markets, including in the midwest and southwest.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P25_S5	We believe the success of our expansion efforts is a testament to the strength and portability of our brand and the power of our multi-channel distribution capabilities.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P25_S6	We intend to utilize these strengths to further penetrate our existing markets and successfully expand our business into foreign markets and relatively underpenetrated U.S. markets.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P25_S7	We plan to expand our retail presence in the United States by opening new stores.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P25_S8	We believe that the market in the United States can support at least 300 Vera Bradley full-price stores.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P25_S9	We plan to open 14 to 16 new stores over the course of fiscal 2012 and 14 to 20 new stores annually during each of the following five fiscal years.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P25_S10	We believe that expansion of our store base complements our Indirect segment by increasing brand awareness and reinforcing our brand image.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Drive Comparable-Store Sales and Our E-Commerce Business.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	We have several ongoing initiatives to drive comparable-store sales growth, including focusing on store-level merchandising programs and enhancing in-store customer service and selling capabilities.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	As a key element of our Direct channel strategy, we will continue to grow our e-commerce business through focused marketing efforts, online merchandising initiatives, and social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P26_S3	We believe our retail and e-commerce businesses are complementary and facilitate frequent contact with our customers.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P26_S4	We design products to accessorize a woman s life and believe this core competence serves as a platform for growth within and beyond our current product lines.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P26_S5	We have expanded our product offerings to include new line extensions, such as our Vera Vera microfiber collection, and brand extensions, such as our paper and stationery collection.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P26_S6	We believe that opportunities exist to accessorize a woman s life through complementary product collections that fit within our positioning as a lifestyle brand.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P26_S7	We introduce new patterns seasonally, four times per year.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P26_S8	Within each season, we generally introduce three to five patterns.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P26_S9	These patterns are incorporated into the designs of a wide range of products, including handbags, accessories, and travel and leisure items, that are part of the core seasonal release.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P26_S10	These products, which constitute our Signature Collection each season, can be classic styles, updates to older designs, or new product introductions.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P26_S11	After each seasonal launch, we release additional new collections, typically once per month throughout the season.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P26_S12	These collections often utilize or are inspired by that season s patterns (e.g., the paper and gift collection in a new pattern), but a few of our releases are separate from the Signature Collection (e.g., the Vera Vera collection in solid colors).
1495320_11_ITEM1_P26_S13	We have increased the number of patterns per Signature release as well as the frequency of subsequent releases over time and believe that the assortment, breadth, and cadence allow us to reach a broader range of consumer demographics and needs.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P26_S14	We believe this approach keeps consumers continually engaged with our brand and repeatedly shopping at our points of distribution.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P26_S15	In addition, we believe this approach allows us to minimize the risk associated with a single pattern not performing to our expectations.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P26_S16	To keep our assortment current and fresh and to focus our inventory investments on our best performers, we discontinue patterns from time to time.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P26_S17	We sell our remaining inventory of discontinued products at our annual outlet sale and through our website and outlet stores.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P26_S18	The following chart presents net revenues generated by each of our three product categories and other revenues as a percentage of our total net revenues for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009:
1495320_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	(1) Includes primarily merchandising, freight, promotional products, and licensing revenues.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	(2) Excludes net revenues generated by our annual outlet sale.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	Handbags are a core part of our product offerings and are the primary component of every Signature Collection.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	The category consists of classic and new styles developed by our product development team to meet consumer demand and drive repeat purchases.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	Our handbag product category extends beyond handbags to include totes and specialty bags such as baby bags, backpacks, and laptop portfolios.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P30_S2	Handbags play a prominent role in our visual merchandising, and we focus on showcasing the different patterns, colors, and features of each bag.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	Accessories, our second largest revenue category, include fashion accessories such as wallets, ID cases, eyeglass cases, cosmetics, paper and gift products, and eyewear.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	Accessories are attractively priced and allow the consumer to include some color in her wardrobe, even if tucked into another bag.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	Our product development team consistently updates the accessories assortment based on consumer demand and fashion trends.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P31_S3	Our travel and leisure product category includes duffel bags, garment bags, and travel accessories, such as travel cosmetic cases.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	The first Vera Bradley product offering included duffel bags, which consistently have been a strong performer.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	We believe their popularity, as well as the appeal of our other travel and leisure items, results from our vibrant designs, functional styles, and lightweight fabrications.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P32_S2	We have implemented a fully integrated and cross-functional product development process that aligns design, market research, merchandise management, sales, marketing, and sourcing.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P32_S3	Product development is a core capability that makes our products unique and provides us with a competitive advantage.

1495320_11_ITEM1_P32_S5	Our product development team mixes an understanding of the needs of our target customers with knowledge of upcoming color and fashion trends to design new collections as well as new product categories that will resonate in the market.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P32_S6	We begin the development stage of our products in the Vera Bradley portfolio 12 18 months in advance of their release.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P32_S7	The development of each new pattern includes the design of an overall print, a complementary fabric backing, and three sizes of coordinating trim materials.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P32_S8	To seek fresh perspectives, we collaborate with independent designers to create unique patterns for each season.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P32_S9	We oversee the development and exercise the final approval of all patterns and designs.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P32_S10	Once developed, we generally copyright each pattern, including the print, fabric backing and coordinating trim.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P32_S11	We believe that great design is not only central to our product development efforts, but also is a fundamental part of our brand development and growth strategies.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P32_S12	In the past several years, we have made investments to evolve and integrate our product development expertise, including opening a design office in New York City.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P32_S13	Our product development team works to ensure that new collections contain an assortment of products and styles that are in line with both fashion trends and customer needs and regularly updates classic styles to enhance functionality.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P32_S14	In addition, we actively pursue opportunities to expand our product offerings through new line and brand extensions.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P32_S15	Our product development team monitors fashion trends and customer needs by attending major trend shows in Europe and the United States, subscribing to trend monitoring services, and engaging in comparison shopping.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P32_S16	Our product development team is also responsible for assortment planning, pricing, forecasting, promotional development, and product lifecycle management.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	Forecasting is based on seasonal market research and in-store testing.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	We gather seasonal market research through a variety of methodologies, including scheduled interviews and online and in-person surveys.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P33_S2	We conduct seasonal in-store testing by releasing test products in our full-price stores and evaluating their success in the marketplace prior to product introduction on a larger scale.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P33_S3	The team assures that we offer a broad range of patterns, fabrics, styles, and functionality features in a cost-effective manner.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P33_S4	We believe that with our cross-functional, collaborative approach, we are able to introduce and sell our merchandise in a way that clearly communicates the Vera Bradley brand and the Vera Bradley lifestyle.

1495320_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	The seasonal Vera Bradley catalog is a key vehicle for the brand and our product portfolio.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P34_S3	Each season s catalog is sent to a targeted customer mailing list.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P34_S4	In addition to distributing the catalog, we produce and distribute a number of other marketing pieces, or collateral, including postcards, gift guides, in-store signage, and release-focused mailers.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P34_S5	Catalogs and collateral provide consumers with a powerful visual representation of both the products and lifestyle images embodied by the Vera Bradley brand.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P34_S6	We believe that Vera Bradley s catalogs and other mailed collateral generate excitement and awareness about the brand and seasonal introductions and allow us to reach both new and loyal customers in their homes.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P34_S7	We employ print and outdoor advertising to increase overall brand awareness.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P34_S8	Our advertisements are placed primarily in national magazines that have a readership similar to our target demographics.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P34_S9	These publications have recently included Seventeen, InStyle, O the Oprah Magazine, and Real Simple.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	We continually assess our advertising strategies and tactics.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	Vera Bradley has received considerable exposure in the press, including in publications such as InStyle, O the Oprah Magazine, Good Housekeeping, Coastal Living, and The New York Times.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	In addition, we have expanded our marketing efforts to promote product placement in feature-length films and on prime-time television shows such as Desperate Housewives, Brothers and Sisters, Entourage, and Modern Family.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P36_S2	In recent years, we have greatly increased traffic to verabradley.com and have increased awareness of our brand through online marketing and social networking sites.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P36_S3	We have captured more than 1.2 million customer e-mail addresses in our online customer file, with many of these customers providing age, occupation, and location data.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P36_S4	This captured information provides us with deeper insight into the products and categories that are in the highest demand, and allows us to better target our customers with appropriate messages.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P36_S5	As of January 29, 2011, we had over 400,000 Facebook fans and a growing number of Twitter followers.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P36_S6	We believe these media not only connect us with our fans, but also allow us to target them through cross-channel marketing.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	Channels of Distribution We distribute our products through our Indirect and Direct channels.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	This multi-channel distribution model not only enables us to have operational flexibility, but also maximizes the methods by which we can access potential customers.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	Indirect Channel As of January 29, 2011, we had approximately 3,300 Indirect retailers, the majority of which were independent retailers with whom we have had long-standing relationships.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P37_S3	In fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, our Indirect channel generated net revenues of $214.9 million, $192.8 million, and $167.5 million, respectively, or, as a percentage of our total net revenues, 58.7%, 66.7%, and 70.2%, respectively.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P37_S4	Indirect retailers are primarily gift, apparel and accessories, travel, or other specialty retailers.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P37_S5	No single account represented more than 2.0% of total Indirect net revenues in fiscal 2011, with the top ten accounts representing in the aggregate less than 10.0% of total Indirect net revenues.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	The majority of our Indirect retailers have been customers for over five years.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	We have developed a retail presence through our full-price stores, all located in the United States, which provides us with a format to showcase the image and products of Vera Bradley.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	2011, we operated 35 full-price stores.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	Our full-price stores average approximately 1,800 square feet per store.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P39_S2	Our stores are designed to create a feeling of home with a high standard of visual merchandising.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P39_S3	The welcoming nature of our full-price stores provides our customers with a comfortable shopping experience in a setting that showcases our merchandise and conveys the Vera Bradley lifestyle.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P39_S4	Our sales associates are passionate about our products and customer service, which, we believe, translates into a superior shopping experience.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P39_S5	In 2006, we began selling our products through the verabradley.com website.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P39_S6	The objective of verabradley.com is to provide both a mechanism for marketing directly to consumers and a storefront where consumers can find the entire Vera Bradley collection.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P39_S7	In fiscal 2010, we invested in upgrades to our website that enable us to provide customized shopping experiences tailored to each online shopper and allow better integration with third-party sites such as Facebook.com.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P39_S8	We believe the enhanced functionality allows us to provide a superior experience to our e-commerce customers.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P39_S9	In fiscal 2011, we had over 32 million visits to verabradley.com.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	As of January 29, 2011, we operated four outlet stores, located in Aurora, Illinois; Wrentham, Massachusetts; Leesburg, Virginia; and San Marcos, Texas.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our outlet stores are a vehicle for selling discontinued merchandise at discounted prices, while maintaining brand identity.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P41_S1	We believe our outlet stores are an integral part of our distribution strategy, as this format provides an additional channel of distribution for our products and enables us to better target value-oriented customers.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P41_S2	For the last ten years, our annual outlet sale has been held in the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum Exposition Center in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P41_S3	The annual outlet sale is an important tradition for Vera Bradley, has many loyal followers, and is an opportunity for us to sell our discontinued merchandise at discounted prices in a brand-right fashion.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P41_S4	We attracted more than 65,000 attendees to our 2010 annual outlet sale.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	Indirect Sales Consultants Historically, we worked with independent sales consultants who were not our employees, but most of whom worked exclusively for us.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	In October 2007, we began transitioning our sales force in-house.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P42_S2	We believe that having an in-house sales force results in more consistent brand presentation and messaging, enhanced support for our Indirect retailers, and a more predictable, scalable, and cost-efficient business model.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P42_S3	As of January 29, 2011, our sales team consisted of 88 in-house, full-time sales consultants.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P42_S4	The compensation structure for our sales consultants consists of a combination of fixed pay and sales-based incentives.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P42_S5	In addition to acquiring new and growing existing accounts, our sales consultants serve as a support center for our Indirect retailers by assisting and educating them in areas such as merchandising and visual presentation, marketing of the brand, product selection, and inventory management.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P42_S6	Our sales consultants also participate in our semi-annual product introduction and education event for our Indirect retailers.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P42_S7	Our visual merchandising program provides our sales consultants with a framework to guide our Indirect retailers regarding optimal product placement and display that is intended to reinforce the message that our brand is distinct from those of our competitors.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our Stores As of January 29, 2011, we operated 35 full-price stores in 24 states throughout the United States.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P43_S1	We believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our store base, as we believe the market in the United States can support at least 300 Vera Bradley full-price stores.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P43_S2	Based on the success of our existing outlet stores, the number of attractive outlet centers in the United States, and the growing popularity of outlet shopping, we believe the United States has capacity to support additional Vera Bradley outlet stores.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	We opened nine full-price stores and three outlet stores in fiscal 2011.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P44_S1	We plan to open 14 to 16 new stores during fiscal 2012 and 14 to 20 new stores annually during each of the following five fiscal years.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P44_S2	Our store location decisions are made case by case, depending on the combined retail strategy we have developed for the particular market.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P44_S3	This includes actual and planned penetration in both Indirect and Direct segments, as well as existing e-commerce demand.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P44_S4	At this time, we do not believe any market has been fully penetrated, and therefore, expansion of our Direct segment should positively affect our Indirect segment.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P44_S5	We believe that expansion of our store base complements our Indirect segment by increasing brand awareness and reinforcing our brand image.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	In addition to analyzing store economics, we pay particular attention to the location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	Along with seeking co-tenants that we believe share our target customer, we seek a balanced mix of moderate and high-end retailers to encourage high levels of traffic.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P45_S2	Our target full-price store size is 1,800 square feet, but we are comfortable with spaces as small as 1,000 square feet or, depending on our market strategy and relevant economic factors, spaces as large as 2,800 square feet.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P45_S3	Our full-price stores are located primarily in high-traffic regional malls, lifestyle centers, and mixed-use shopping centers across the United States.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P45_S4	The following table shows the number of full-price stores we operated in each state as of January 29, 2011:
1495320_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	In addition, as of January 29, 2011, we had a total of four outlet stores located in Illinois, Massachusetts, Texas, and Virginia.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	The focus of our store operations is providing consumers with a comfortable shopping experience.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	We strive to make the experience interactive through special store events, such as showcasing newly launched products or celebrating our namesake s birthday.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P47_S2	Our customer service philosophy emphasizes friendly service, merchandise knowledge, and passion for the brand.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P47_S3	Consequently, an essential requirement for the success of our stores is our ability to attract, train, and retain talented, highly motivated district managers, store managers, and sales associates.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P47_S4	Our district and store managers are our primary link to the consumer, and we continually invest in their development.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P47_S5	We believe that our innovative retail concept and distinctive retail experience contribute to the success of our stores, most of which generate strong productivity and returns.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	approximately 1,800 square feet per store, and we expect to invest approximately $0.4 million per new store, consisting of inventory costs, pre-opening costs, and build-out costs less tenant-improvement allowances.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P48_S1	New full-price stores generate on average between $1.1 million and $1.3 million in net revenues during the first twelve months, and the payback on our investment is expected to occur in less than 18 months.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P48_S2	Typically, we have found that, as a new store becomes better integrated into its community and brand awareness grows, the store s productivity tends to improve as measured by comparable-store sales.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	Manufacturing and Supply Chain Model Our manufacturing and supply chain model is designed to maximize flexibility in order to meet shifting demands in the market.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	Our model utilizes offshore raw material suppliers and a blend of offshore and domestic manufacturing.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P49_S2	We place a strong emphasis on continuous improvement of the model and have employed lean manufacturing concepts.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P49_S3	Our broad-based, multi-country manufacturing and supply chain model is designed to achieve efficient, timely, and accurate order fulfillment while maintaining appropriate levels of inventory.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P49_S4	Our sourcing strategy is part of the larger cross-functional product development process.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P49_S5	The overall objective for our sourcing team is to build and sustain collaborative partnerships throughout our supply chain.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P49_S6	The sourcing team leverages its expertise in negotiation, relationship management, and change management to maintain a strong global supply chain.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	The majority of our products are cotton-based.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our other products are made from specialty fabrics (including nylon and microfiber) and paper.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P50_S2	We source our materials from various suppliers in Asia, with the majority coming from China and South Korea.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P50_S3	Our global supply chain and purchasing teams work together to select suppliers that enable us to optimize the mix of cost, lead time, quality, and reliability within our global supply network.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P50_S4	All of our suppliers must comply with our quality standards, and we use only a limited number of pre-approved suppliers who have demonstrated a commitment to delivering the highest quality products.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P50_S5	In December 2008, we opened an office in Dongguan, China, which enables us to increase our control over the manufacturing and supply chain process and monitor compliance with our quality standards.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	A significant majority of our finished goods products are manufactured externally overseas.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P51_S1	These products are made by a variety of global manufacturers located primarily in China.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P51_S2	We are not dependent upon any single manufacturer for our products.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P51_S3	When determining the size of orders placed with our manufacturers, we take into account forward-looking demand, lead times for specific products, current inventory levels, and minimum order quantity requirements.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	Overseas production has resulted in substantial cost savings and reduction of capital investment.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P52_S1	With the oversight of our office in China and our independent contractors, we believe these financial benefits have been realized without sacrificing the level of quality inherent in our products or service to our customers.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P52_S2	The remainder of our products are manufactured in the United States to provide flexibility in our supply chain.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P52_S3	This production, almost all of which is internal to Vera Bradley, enables us to manufacture a finished product in as quickly as two weeks.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P52_S4	This capability allows us to manufacture finished product to respond quickly to shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P52_S5	In fiscal 2011, approximately 10% of our units were produced in our domestic manufacturing facility.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P52_S6	In 2007, we consolidated our warehousing and shipping functions into one, 217,320 square-foot distribution center, located in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P52_S7	This highly automated, computerized facility allows Vera Bradley employees to receive information directly from the order-collection center and quickly identify the products and quantity necessary for a particular order.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P52_S8	In addition, we employ a warehouse-control system that controls the flow of our products through 5,000 feet of automated conveyer.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P52_S9	The facility s advanced technology enables us to more accurately process and pack orders, as well as track shipments and inventory.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P52_S10	We believe that our systems for the processing and shipment of orders from our distribution center have enabled us to improve our overall customer service through enhanced order accuracy and reduced turnaround time.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	We strive to maintain the appropriate balance of inventory to enable us to provide a high level of service to our customers, including prompt and accurate delivery of our products.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	We have an active sales and operations planning process that helps us balance the supply and demand issues that we encounter in our business, optimize our inventory levels, and anticipate inventory needs.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P53_S2	Our products are shipped primarily via FedEx and common carriers to our stores, our Indirect retailers, and directly to our customers who purchase through our website.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P53_S3	We believe we are positioned well to support the order fulfillment requirements of our growing business, including business generated through our website.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P53_S4	We believe that high levels of automation and technology are essential to maintain our competitive position.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P53_S5	We maintain computer hardware, systems applications, and networks to enhance and accelerate the design process, to support the sale and distribution of our products to our customers, and to improve the integration and efficiency of our operations.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P53_S6	Our management information systems are designed to provide, among other things, comprehensive order processing, production, accounting, and management information for the product development, retail, sales, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, finance, and human resources functions of our business.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P53_S7	We use several specialized systems, including micros Retail, SAP, and ILS, for our information technology requirements.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	Competition We face strong competition in each of the product lines and markets in which we compete.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P54_S1	We believe that all of our products are in similar competitive positions with respect to the number of competitors they face and the level of competition within each product line.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P54_S2	Due to the number of different products we offer, it is not practicable for us to quantify the number of competitors we face.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P54_S3	Our products compete with other branded products within their product categories and with private label products sold by retailers.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P54_S4	In our Indirect business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers, and distributors of handbags, accessories, and other products for the limited space available for the display of such products to the consumer.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P54_S5	Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	In our Direct business, we compete against other specialty retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, gift retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P55_S1	The market for handbags, in particular, is highly competitive.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P55_S2	Our competitors include not only established companies that are expanding their production and marketing of handbags, but also frequent new entrants to the market.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P55_S3	We directly compete with wholesalers and direct sellers of branded handbags and accessories, such as Coach, Nine West, Liz Claiborne, and Dooney Bourke.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P55_S4	In varying degrees, depending on the product category involved, we compete on the basis of design (aesthetic appeal), quality (construction), function, price point, distribution, and brand positioning.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P55_S5	We believe that our primary competitive advantages are consumer recognition of our brand, customer loyalty, product development expertise, and our widespread presence through our multi-channel distribution model.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P55_S6	Some of our competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources than we do.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P55_S7	Further, we may face new competitors and increased competition from existing competitors as we expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	Copyrights and Trademarks The development of each new pattern includes the design of an overall print, a complementary fabric backing, and three sizes of coordinating trim materials.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P56_S1	Once developed, we generally copyright each pattern, including the print, fabric backing, and coordinating trim.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P56_S2	We currently have in excess of 300 copyrights.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	We also own all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing, and distribution of all of our products, both in the United States and in the other countries in which our products are principally sold.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	We aggressively police our trademarks and copyrights and pursue infringers both domestically and internationally.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P57_S2	We also pursue counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally, as well as through external sources monitoring use in the market.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P57_S3	Our trademarks will remain in existence for as long as we continue to use and renew them on their expiration dates.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	Employees As of January 29, 2011, we had 1,427 employees.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P58_S1	Of the total, 567 were engaged in retail selling and retail administration positions, 265 were engaged in manufacturing functions, 29 were engaged in product design, and 364 were engaged in corporate support and administrative functions.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P58_S2	The remaining employees were engaged in other aspects of our business.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P58_S3	None of our employees is represented by a union.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P58_S4	We believe that our relations with our employees are good, and we have never encountered a strike or significant work stoppage.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	Many of our imported products are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs, or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the United States and other countries or impact the cost of such products.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P59_S1	To date, we have not been restricted by quotas in the operation of our business, and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of a majority of our products.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P59_S2	In addition, we are subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions, including U.S. retaliation against prohibited foreign practices, with respect to our product sourcing and international sales operations.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P59_S3	We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental matters, including the handling, transportation, and disposal of our products and our non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, and groundwater.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P59_S4	Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties, or the imposition of other liabilities.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect upon our earnings or financial position.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	If we violate any environmental obligation, however, it could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance.
1495320_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on our website, www.verabradley.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
1495320_11_ITEM1_P61_S1	No information contained on our website is intended to be included as part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	consider all of the information in this report, particularly the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in future periods.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The risks described below are not the only risks that we face.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in future periods.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Risks Related to Our Business Changes in general economic conditions, and their impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In recent years, consumer confidence and consumer spending deteriorated significantly, influenced by fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, changing fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, higher levels of unemployment and consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty, and this could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S3	In the event of another significant economic downturn, we could experience lower than expected net revenues, which could force us to delay or slow the implementation of our growth strategies and adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our inability to predict and respond in a timely manner to changes in consumer demand could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Our success depends on our ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies consumer demand in a timely manner.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S7	We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to develop appealing patterns and styles or meet changing consumer demands in the future.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S8	If we misjudge the market for our products, we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Merchandise misjudgments could adversely impact our net revenues and results of operations.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S10	Our results of operations could suffer if we lose key management or design associates or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S11	Our performance depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and product development teams.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S12	These executives and design associates have substantial experience in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S13	We do not have employment agreements with any of our key executives or design associates, and we do not maintain a key person life insurance policy on most of our key executives.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S14	The unexpected loss of services of certain of these individuals could have adverse impacts on our business and results of operations.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S15	As our business grows and we open new stores, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees and develop, train, and manage an increasing number of management-level, sales, and other employees.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S16	Competition for qualified employees is intense.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S17	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain employees as needed in the future.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S18	Our business depends on a strong brand.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S19	If we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand, then we may be unable to sell our products, which would adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P1_S20	We believe that the brand image that we have developed has contributed significantly to the success of our business.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as product design, store operations, and community relations.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brand image, our results of operations would be adversely impacted.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	If we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategies or manage our growing business, our future operating results could suffer.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	The success of our growth strategies, alone or collectively, will depend on various factors, including the appeal of our product designs, retail presentation to consumers, competitive conditions, and economic conditions.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P2_S4	If we are unsuccessful in implementing some or all of our strategies or initiatives, our future operating results could be adversely impacted.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Successful implementation of our strategies will require us to manage our growth.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P2_S6	To manage our growth effectively, we will need to continue to increase production while maintaining strict quality control.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P2_S7	We also will need to continue to improve and invest in our systems and processes to keep pace with planned increases in demand.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P2_S8	We could suffer a decline in sales if our products do not continue to meet our quality control standards or if we are unable to respond adequately to increases in customer demand for our products.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P2_S9	We may not be able to successfully open and operate new stores as planned, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Our continued growth will depend on our ability to successfully open and operate new stores.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P2_S11	We plan to open 14 to 16 new stores over the course of fiscal 2012 and 14 to 20 new stores during each of the following five fiscal years.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P2_S12	Our ability to successfully open and operate new stores depends on many factors, including our ability to:
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	successfully integrate new stores into our existing operations and information technology systems.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The success of new store openings may also be affected by our ability to initiate marketing efforts in advance of opening our first store in a particular region.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Additionally, we will encounter pre-operating costs and we may encounter initial losses while new stores commence operations, which could strain our resources and adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our inability to sustain levels of comparable-store sales could cause our stock price to decline.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P3_S4	We may not be able to sustain the levels of comparable-store sales that we have experienced in the recent past.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P3_S5	If our future comparable-store sales decline or fail to meet market expectations, then the price of our common stock could decline.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Also, the aggregate results of operations of our stores have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Numerous factors influence comparable-store sales, including fashion trends, competition, national and regional economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, inventory shrinkage, marketing programs, and weather conditions.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In addition, many companies with retail operations have been unable to sustain high levels of comparable-store sales during and after periods of substantial expansion.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	These factors may cause our comparable-store sales results to be lower in the future than in recent periods or lower than expectations, either of which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We do not own any real estate other than our warehouse and distribution facility.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We lease our corporate headquarters, our other offices, and all of our store locations.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	We typically occupy our stores under operating leases with terms of ten years.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We have been able to negotiate favorable rental rates in recent years due in part to the state of the economy and high vacancy rates within some shopping centers, but there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to negotiate such favorable terms.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Some of our leases have early cancellation clauses, which permit the lease to be terminated by us or the landlord if certain sales levels are not met in specific periods or if the shopping center does not meet specified occupancy standards.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P5_S6	In addition to requiring future minimum lease payments, some of our store leases provide for the payment of common area maintenance charges, real property insurance, and real estate taxes.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Many of our lease agreements have escalating rent provisions over the initial term and any extensions.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P5_S8	As we expand our store base, our lease expense and our cash outlays for rent under lease agreements will increase.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P5_S9	Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including:
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	limiting our ability to obtain additional financing.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Any of these consequences could place us at a disadvantage with respect to our competitors.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We depend on cash flow from operating activities to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses and needs, we may not be able to service our lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would harm our business.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Additional sites that we lease may be subject to long-term non-cancelable leases if we are unable to negotiate our current standard lease terms.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P7_S3	If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, including paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Moreover, even if a lease has an early cancellation clause, we may not satisfy the contractual requirements for early cancellation under the lease.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Our inability to enter new leases or renew existing leases on acceptable terms or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that we close would, in any such case, affect us adversely.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P7_S6	We operate in a competitive market.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P7_S7	Our competitors might develop products more popular with consumers than our products.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The market for handbags, accessories, and travel and leisure items is competitive.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	establishing and maintaining good working relationships with our Indirect retailers.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In our Indirect business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers, and distributors of handbags, accessories, and other products for the limited space available for the display of such products to the consumer.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In our Direct business, we compete against other gift and specialty retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We rely on various contract manufacturers to produce a significant majority of our products and generally do not have long-term contracts with our manufacturers.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Disruptions in our contract manufacturers systems, losses of manufacturing certifications, or other actions by these manufacturers could increase our cost of sales, adversely affect our net revenues, and injure our reputation and customer relationships, thereby harming our business.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Our various contract manufacturers produce a significant majority of our products.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P10_S6	We generally do not enter into long-term formal written agreements with our manufacturers and instead transact business with each of them on an order-by-order basis.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P10_S7	In the event of a disruption in our contract manufacturers systems, we may be unable to locate alternative manufacturers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P10_S8	Identifying a suitable manufacturer is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with the prospective manufacturer s quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability, and labor practices.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P10_S9	Any delay, interruption, or increased cost in the manufactured products that might occur for any reason, such as the lack of long-term contracts or regulatory requirements and the loss of certifications, power interruptions, fires, hurricanes, war, or threats of terrorism, could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products, adversely affect our net revenues, increase our cost of sales, and hurt our results of operations.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P10_S10	In addition, manufacturing disruption could injure our reputation and customer relationships, thereby harming our business.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We rely on various suppliers to supply a significant majority of our raw materials.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Disruption in the supply of raw materials could increase our cost of goods sold and adversely affect our net revenues.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We generally do not enter into long-term formal written agreements with our suppliers and typically transact business with each of them on an order-by-order basis.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P11_S3	As a result, we cannot assure that there will be no significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from our current sources or, in the event of a disruption, that we would be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P11_S4	We rely on a single warehouse and distribution facility for all of the products we sell.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Disruption to that facility could adversely impact our results of operations, and expansion of that facility could have unpredictable adverse effects.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Our warehouse and distribution operations are currently concentrated in a single, company-owned distribution center in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Any significant disruption in the operation of the facility due to natural disaster or severe weather, or events such as fire, accidents, power outages, system failures, or other unforeseen causes, could devalue or damage a significant portion of our inventory and could adversely affect our product distribution and sales until such time as we could secure an alternative facility.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P11_S8	If we encounter difficulties with our distribution facility or other problems or disasters arise, we cannot ensure that critical systems and operations will be restored in a timely manner or at all, and this would have a material adverse effect on our business.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P11_S9	In addition, our growth could require us to expand our current facility, which could affect us adversely in ways that we cannot predict.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P11_S10	The cost of raw materials could increase our cost of sales and cause our results of operations to suffer.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	sales and our ability to meet our customers demands.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In particular, fluctuations in the price of cotton, our primary raw material, could have an adverse impact on our cost of sales.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In addition, because a key component of our quilted products is petroleum-based, the cost of oil affects the cost of our products.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Upward movement in the price of oil in the global oil markets would also likely result in rising fuel and freight prices, which could increase our shipping costs.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P12_S4	In the future, we may not be able to pass all or a portion of higher costs on to our customers.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing and manufacturing activities.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P12_S6	We source our fabrics primarily from manufacturers in China and South Korea and outsource the production of a significant majority of our products to companies in Asia.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P12_S7	We are subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing and manufacturing, including, but not limited to:
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	natural disasters, acts of war and terrorism, changing macroeconomic trends, and other external factors over which we have no control.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Additionally, we do not have complete oversight over our contract manufacturers.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Violation of labor or other laws by those manufacturers, or the divergence of a contract manufacturer s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States or in other markets in which we may in the future do business, could also draw negative publicity for us and our brand, diminishing the value of our brand and reducing demand for our products.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Our ability to source our products at favorable prices, or at all, could be harmed, with adverse effects on our results of operations, if new trade restrictions are imposed or if existing trade restrictions become more burdensome.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	A significant majority of our products are currently manufactured for us in Asia.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The United States and the countries in which our products are produced have imposed and may impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or regulations or may adversely adjust prevailing quotas, duties, or tariffs.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Countries impose, modify, and remove tariffs and other trade restrictions in response to a diverse array of factors, including global and national economic and political conditions, which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other trade restrictions.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Trade restrictions, which include embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us or could require us to modify supply chain organization or other current business practices, any of which could harm our results of operations.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs, especially if the Employee Free Choice Act is adopted.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Currently, none of our employees is represented by a union.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Nevertheless, our employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to organize or affiliate with a union.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	were to become unionized, our business would be exposed to work stoppages and slowdowns as a unionized business.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	If, in addition, the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly more favorable to union workers than our current pay-and-benefits arrangements, our costs would increase and our results of operations would suffer.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Employee Free Choice Act of 2007: H.R. 800, or EFCA, was passed in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2007, and the same legislation has been re-introduced as H.R. 1409 and S. 560.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	President Obama and leaders of Congress have made public statements in support of this bill.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Accordingly, the EFCA, or a variant of it, could become law.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Enactment of the EFCA could have adverse effects on our business by making it easier for workers to obtain union representation and by increasing the penalties that employers may incur by engaging in labor practices that violate the National Labor Relations Act.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Our results of operations are subject to quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including, among other things:
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	the timing of new pattern releases and new product introductions.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	As a result of these quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our sales and operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Any quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	This could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P19_S4	We rely on independent transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We currently rely on independent transportation service providers for substantially all of our product shipments.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our utilization of these delivery services, or those of any other shipping companies that we may elect to use, is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, and employee strikes and inclement weather, which may impact the shipping company s ability to provide delivery services sufficient to meet our shipping needs.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If for any reason we were to change shipping companies, we could face logistical difficulties that might adversely affect deliveries, and we would incur costs and expend resources in the course of making the change.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Moreover, we might not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from the service providers that we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We also would face shipping and distribution risks and uncertainties associated with any expansion of our warehouse and distribution facility and related systems.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P20_S5	We plan to use cash provided by operating activities to fund our expanding business and execute our growth strategies and may require additional capital, which may not be available to us.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Our business relies on cash provided by operating activities as our primary source of liquidity.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	If our business does not generate cash flow from operating activities sufficient to fund these activities, and if sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from our existing revolving credit facility, we will need to seek additional capital, through debt or equity financings, to fund our growth.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us or at all.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Additional debt financing that we may undertake might impose upon us covenants that restrict our operations and strategic initiatives, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our capital stock, make investments, and engage in merger, consolidation, and asset sale transactions.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Equity financings may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our shareholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our equity securities may be lower than the price per share of our common stock in this offering.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P21_S4	The holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences, or privileges that are senior to those of existing holders of common stock.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	If new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, then we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would inhibit our growth and could harm our business.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We face various risks as an e-commerce retailer.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Business risks relating to e-commerce sales include the need to keep pace with rapid technological change, internet security risks, risks of system failure or inadequacy, governmental regulation, and taxation.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We have contracted with several different companies to maintain and operate various aspects of our e-commerce business and are reliant on them and their ability to perform their tasks, as well as their operational, privacy, and security procedures and controls as they affect our business.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If the independent contractors on which we rely fail to perform their tasks, we could incur liability or suffer damages to our reputation, or both.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Our copyrights, trademarks and other proprietary rights could conflict with the rights of others, and we may be inhibited from selling some of our products.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P23_S5	If we are unable to protect our copyrights and other proprietary rights, others may sell imitation brand products.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P23_S6	We believe that our registered copyrights, registered and common law trademarks, and other proprietary rights have significant value and are critical to our ability to create and sustain demand for our products.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P23_S7	Although we have not been inhibited from selling our products in connection with intellectual property disputes, we cannot assure you that obstacles will not arise as we expand our product line and extend our brand as well as the geographic scope of our sales and marketing.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P23_S8	We also cannot assure you that the actions taken by us to establish and protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products or infringement of our rights by others.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P23_S9	The legal regimes of some foreign countries, particularly China, may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by others in these countries.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P23_S10	The loss of copyrights, trademarks, and other proprietary rights could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P23_S11	Any litigation regarding our proprietary rights could be time consuming and costly.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P23_S12	Prior to the completion of the Reorganization, we were treated as an S Corporation under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code, and claims of taxing authorities related to our prior status as an S Corporation could harm us.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P23_S13	Possible changes in tax laws also would affect our results.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P23_S14	Upon the completion of the Reorganization, our S Corporation status terminated automatically and we became subject to increased federal and state income taxes.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P23_S15	If the unaudited, open tax years in which we were an S Corporation are audited by the Internal Revenue Service, and we are determined not to have qualified for, or to have violated, our S Corporation status, we will be obligated to pay back taxes, interest, and penalties, and we do not have the right to reclaim tax distributions we have made to our shareholders during those periods.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P23_S16	These amounts could include taxes on all of our taxable income while we were an S Corporation.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P23_S17	Any such claims could result in additional costs to us and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P23_S18	In addition, possible changes in federal, state, local, and non-U.S. tax laws bearing upon our revenues, income, property, or other aspects of our operations or business would, if enacted, affect our results of operations in ways and to a degree that we cannot currently predict.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting, which could have an adverse impact on our business.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Reporting obligations as a newly public company may place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems, processes, and controls, as well as on our personnel.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In addition, as a newly public company, we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ( Sarbanes Oxley ) so that our management can certify the effectiveness of our internal controls and our independent registered public accounting firm can render an opinion on management s assessment and on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting by the time our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2012 is due and thereafter.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P24_S3	As a result, we may need to improve our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems, and procedures, to incur substantial expenses to test our systems, and to hire additional qualified personnel.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P24_S4	If our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an unqualified opinion on management s assessment and on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and loss of public confidence, which could harm our business and cause a decline in our stock price.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P24_S5	In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes, and controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance timely, which could cause a decline in our stock price and harm our ability to raise capital.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Failure to accurately report our financial performance timely could also jeopardize our continued listing on The NASDAQ Global Select Market.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P24_S7	As a result of our recent initial public offering, our costs have increased significantly and our management is required to devote substantial time to complying with public company regulations.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P24_S8	We have historically operated our business as a private company.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P24_S9	In October 2010, we completed an initial public offering.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P24_S10	As a result, we are required to incur additional legal, accounting, compliance and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We are obligated to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) quarterly and annual information and other reports that are specified in Section 13 and other sections of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ).
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In addition, we are also subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including certain requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market, and certain provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose significant compliance obligations upon us.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We must be certain that we have the ability to institute and maintain a comprehensive compliance function; established internal policies; ensure that we have the ability to prepare financial statements that are fully compliant with all SEC reporting requirements on a timely basis; design, establish, evaluate and maintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley; involve and retain outside counsel and accountants in connection with the above activities and maintain an investor relations function.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Sarbanes-Oxley, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market, have imposed increased regulation and disclosure and have required enhanced corporate governance practices of public companies.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards in this regard are likely to result in increased administrative expenses and a diversion of management s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	These changes require a significant commitment of resources.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	We may not be successful in implementing or maintaining these requirements, any failure of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P26_S4	In addition, if we fail to implement or maintain the requirements with respect to our internal accounting and audit functions, our ability to continue to report our operating results on a timely and accurate basis could be impaired.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P26_S5	If we do not implement or maintain such requirements in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or The NASDAQ Stock Market.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Any such action could harm our reputation and the confidence of investors and customers in our company and could materially adversely affect our business and cause our share price to fall.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Additional indebtedness incurred in connection with the Reorganization may decrease business flexibility and increase borrowing costs.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	On October 4, 2010, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that increased our available credit from $75 million to $125 million.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Also in October 2010, in connection with the Reorganization, we increased the outstanding borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement to fund a final S Corporation distribution to our then-shareholders.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	As of January 29, 2011, we had outstanding borrowings of $66.8 million under our amended and restated credit agreement, compared to $30.0 million outstanding under our former credit facility as of January 30, 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P28_S3	This increased indebtedness and resulting higher debt-to-equity ratio in comparison to our indebtedness and debt-to-equity ratio on a recent historical basis could have the effect, among other things, of:
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to companies that have less debt.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our Indirect business could suffer as a result of bankruptcies or operational or financial difficulties of our Indirect retailers.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We do not enter into long-term agreements with any of our Indirect retailers.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers for each of our lines every season.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P29_S4	A decision by a significant number of Indirect retailers, whether motivated by competitive conditions, operational or financial difficulties, reduced access to capital, or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or to change their manner of doing business with us could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	As a result of the recent unfavorable economic environment, we have experienced a softening of demand from a number of Indirect retailers.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Although we recommend retail sale prices for our products to our Indirect retailers, we do not provide dealer allowances or other economic incentives to support those prices.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Possible promotional pricing or discounting by Indirect retailers in response to softening retail demand could have a negative effect on our brand image and prestige, which might be difficult to counteract as the economy improves.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We sell our Indirect merchandise primarily to specialty retail stores across the United States and extend trade credit based on an evaluation of each Indirect retailer s financial condition, usually without requiring collateral.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Perceived financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Pending the resolution of a relationship with a financially troubled Indirect retailer, we might assume credit risk that we would otherwise avoid relating to our receivables from that customer.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Inability to collect on accounts receivable from our Indirect retailers would adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P32_S3	There are claims made against us from time to time that can result in litigation or regulatory proceedings, which could distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability or damage to our brand image.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P32_S4	As a growing company with expanding operations, we increasingly face the risk of litigation and other claims against us.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Litigation and other claims may arise in the ordinary course of our business and include employee claims, commercial disputes, intellectual property issues, product-oriented allegations, and slip and fall claims.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P32_S6	Often these cases raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time.
1495320_11_ITEM1A_P32_S7	Litigation and other claims against us could result in unexpected expenses and liability, as well as materially adversely affect our operations and our reputation.

1495320_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	This property is owned by Milburn, LLC, a leasing company in which Barbara Bradley Baekgaard owns a 50% interest and Patricia R. Miller and P. Michael Miller each own a 25% interest.
1495320_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, of this report for additional information regarding this property.
1495320_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	As of January 29, 2011, we also leased 43 store locations in the United States, including four store locations opened or to be opened in fiscal 2012.
1495320_11_ITEM2_P2_S1	See Business Our Stores Store Locations for more information regarding the locations of our open stores as of January 29, 2011.
1495320_11_ITEM2_P2_S2	Additionally, we currently are negotiating a lease with Great Dane Realty, LLC, a company owned by Barbara Bradley Baekgaard, for approximately 39,000 square feet of office and warehouse space in a building located adjacent to our distribution center in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

1495320_11_ITEM2_P2_S4	We consider these properties to be in good condition generally and believe that our facilities, including the above-mentioned property under negotiation, are adequate for our operations and provide sufficient capacity to meet our anticipated requirements.

1495320_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the ordinary course, we are involved in the policing of our intellectual property rights.
1495320_11_ITEM3_P0_S2	As part of our policing program, from time to time we file lawsuits in the United States and abroad, alleging acts of trademark counterfeiting, trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and ancillary and pendent state and foreign law claims.
1495320_11_ITEM3_P0_S3	These actions often result in seizure of counterfeit merchandise and negotiated settlements with defendants.
1495320_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	Defendants sometimes raise as affirmative defenses, or as counterclaims, the purported invalidity or unenforceability of our proprietary rights.
1495320_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	We believe that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
1495320_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol VRA since our initial public offering on October 21, 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices of our common stock, as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market, during each fiscal quarter since our initial public offering:
1495320_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of March 31, 2011, we had approximately 27 shareholders of record.
1495320_11_ITEM5_P1_S1	The number of shareholders of record is based upon the actual number of shareholders registered at such date and does not include holders of shares in street names or persons, partnerships, associates, corporations, or other entities identified in security position listings maintained by depositories.
1495320_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	Dividends Our common stock began trading on October 21, 2010, following our initial public offering.
1495320_11_ITEM5_P2_S1	Since that time, we have not declared any cash dividends, and we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1495320_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	Prior to our initial public offering, as an S Corporation, we distributed annually to our shareholders amounts sufficient to cover their tax liabilities, due to the income that flowed through the shareholders tax returns.
1495320_11_ITEM5_P3_S1	Additional amounts were distributed from time to time to our shareholders at the discretion of the board of directors.
1495320_11_ITEM5_P3_S2	During fiscal 2010, we paid distributions of $25.6 million to our shareholders.
1495320_11_ITEM5_P3_S3	During fiscal 2011, we paid distributions of $132.8 million to our shareholders, which included a final distribution (resulting from the termination of our S Corporation status) of 100% of our undistributed taxable income from the date of our formation through October 2, 2010.

1495320_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	Stock Performance Graph The graph set forth below compares the cumulative shareholder return on our common stock between October 21, 2010 (the date of our initial public offering), and January 29, 2011, to the cumulative return of (i) the S P 500 Index and (ii) the S P 500 Apparel, Accessories, and Luxury Goods Index over the same period.
1495320_11_ITEM5_P5_S1	This graph assumes an initial investment of $100 on October 21, 2010, in our common stock, the S P 500 Index, and the S P 500 Apparel, Accessories, and Luxury Goods Index and assumes the reinvestment of dividends, if any.
1495320_11_ITEM5_P5_S2	The graph also assumes that the initial price of our common stock on October 21, 2010, was the initial public offering price of $16.00 per share and that the initial prices of the S P 500 Index and the S P 500 Apparel, Accessories, and Luxury Goods Index on October 21, 2010, were the closing prices on the previous trading day.

1495320_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	(1) In January 2008, we changed our fiscal year end from December 31 to the Saturday closest to January 31.
1495320_11_ITEM6_P2_S1	As a result this change, fiscal 2009 included activity for more than 52 weeks.
1495320_11_ITEM6_P2_S2	This was a one-time occurrence and did not have a material effect on our results of operations.
1495320_11_ITEM6_P3_S0	The table below presents selected consolidated financial data as of and for the calendar months ended January 31, 2008, and January 31, 2007.

1495320_11_ITEM6_P5_S0	(3) On October 3, 2010, we converted from an S Corporation to a C Corporation for income-tax purposes.

1495320_11_ITEM6_P6_S0	(4) On October 18, 2010, we effectuated a 35.437-for-1 stock split of all outstanding shares of our common stock.
1495320_11_ITEM6_P6_S1	We have changed all historical share and per share information to reflect this stock split.
1495320_11_ITEM6_P7_S0	(5) Our first full-price store opened in mid-September 2007.
1495320_11_ITEM6_P7_S1	These data exclude our outlet stores.
1495320_11_ITEM6_P8_S0	(6) Comparable-store sales are the net revenues of our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the period.

1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Vera Bradley is a leading designer, producer, marketer, and retailer of stylish and highly functional accessories for women.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our products include a wide offering of handbags, accessories, and travel and leisure items.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	Over our 29-year history, Vera Bradley has become a true lifestyle brand that appeals to a broad range of consumers.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S3	Our brand vision is accessible luxury that inspires a casual, fun, and family-oriented lifestyle.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S4	We have positioned our brand to highlight the high quality, distinctive and vibrant styling, and functional design of our products.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S5	Frequent releases of new designs help keep the brand fresh and our customers continually engaged.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S6	We generate revenues by selling products through two reportable segments: Indirect and Direct.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S7	As of January 29, 2011, our Indirect business consisted of sales of Vera Bradley products to approximately 3,300 independent retailers, substantially all of which are located in the United States, as well as to select national retailers and independent e-commerce sites.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S8	As of January 29, 2011, our Direct business consisted of sales of Vera Bradley products through our 35 full-price stores, four outlet stores, verabradley.com, and our annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S9	We began selling directly to consumers through verabradley.com in 2006, and we opened our first retail store in 2007.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S10	In recent years, we have grown rapidly as a result of the successful implementation of strategic initiatives.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S11	These initiatives included enhancing our merchandising strategy, establishing a multi-channel distribution sales model, and expanding our supply chain capabilities, product development processes, and information systems to improve operational flexibility and profitability.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S12	Due to the implementation of these key strategic initiatives, we experienced substantial growth in calendar years 2006 and 2007 as the Vera Bradley brand gained broader exposure in the marketplace.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S13	The introduction in 2006 of Java Blue, the best selling pattern in our history, also significantly influenced our growth during this period.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S14	We attribute the success of Java Blue to the pattern s universal appeal across all demographic segments of our customer base and its ability to attract many consumers to the Vera Bradley brand for the first time.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S15	While sales of Java Blue patterned products contributed meaningfully to our growth in 2006 and 2007, the popularity of Java Blue also positively impacted the sales of our products in other Vera Bradley patterns during the same period.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S16	During this period, our net revenues grew from $189.1 million in calendar year 2006 to $281.1 million in calendar year 2007.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S17	In fiscal 2009, our net revenues declined $42.5 million, or 15.1%, as the economic environment weakened.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S18	Consumer purchases of handbags and accessories generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S19	For our Indirect retailers, the majority of which are independent small businesses, this resulted in reduced traffic and a decline in sales.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S20	In addition to being impacted by softening consumer demand from our Indirect retailers and other consumers, our net revenues were negatively impacted by excess inventory levels held by our Indirect retailers at the end of calendar year 2007.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P1_S21	Excess inventory levels resulted from the rapidly deteriorating economic environment following a period of increasing consumer demand for our products in 2006 and 2007 and the sharp increase in orders from our Indirect retailers following the introduction of our Java Blue pattern.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	effects of softening demand and excess inventory.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	In fiscal 2009, during the challenging environment presented by the economic recession, we focused our efforts on managing our cost structure and reducing inventories while continuing to invest in our infrastructure to support future growth.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	As a result, in fiscal 2009 our operating income decreased to $27.2 million.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	In fiscal 2010, we experienced strong sales growth with net revenues of $288.9 million, an increase of 21.1% over fiscal 2009, despite the continued economic recession.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P3_S3	This growth was driven by the impact of our strategic initiatives, including our expanding Direct business, the reduction of inventory levels in our Indirect channel that had occurred by the end of fiscal 2009 and increasing demand based on improving consumer confidence.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P3_S4	In addition, fiscal 2010 net revenues in both the Indirect and Direct segments benefited from the increased frequency of releases of our collections, as well as the expansion of our range of patterns.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P3_S5	During the same period, operating income increased to $45.7 million, or 68.1%, due primarily to the increase in net revenues combined with operational and supply chain improvements that enhanced our gross margin and operating margin.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P3_S6	In fiscal 2011, we again achieved strong sales growth, with net revenues of $366.1 million, an increase of 26.7% over fiscal 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P3_S7	This growth was driven primarily by our expanding Direct business, growing product assortment, improving economic conditions, and increasing brand awareness.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P3_S8	During fiscal 2011, we remained focused on executing our growth strategies, which included growing in underpenetrated markets and expanding our U.S. store base and product offerings.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P3_S9	In doing so, we opened nine full-price and three outlet stores, delivered four Signature Collection releases with more patterns than ever before, continued to widen the assortment of our paper collection, and released a greater number of other collections, including a special gift collection during the Christmas holiday season.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P3_S10	We also achieved strong operating income growth.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P3_S11	Fiscal 2011 operating income, which included $21.9 million of stock-based and other compensation expense related to restricted-stock awards that vested upon our October 2010 initial public offering, increased 16.6% to $53.3 million.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P3_S12	We believe the combination of our expanding product offerings and continued growth in underpenetrated markets will lead to meaningful growth opportunities in fiscal 2012.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P3_S13	We believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our store base, as we believe the market in the United States can support at least 300 Vera Bradley full-price stores.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P3_S14	To that end, during fiscal 2011, we opened nine full-price stores and three outlet stores.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P3_S15	We expect our full-price stores to average approximately 1,800 square feet per store, and we expect to invest approximately $0.4 million per new store, consisting of inventory costs, pre-opening costs and build-out costs less tenant-improvement allowances.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P3_S16	New full-price stores are expected to generate on average between $1.1 million and $1.3 million in net revenues during the first twelve months, and the payback on our investment is expected to occur in less than 18 months.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Typically, we have found that, as a new store becomes better integrated into its community and brand awareness grows, the store s productivity tends to improve as measured by comparable-store sales.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	We believe our business strategy will continue to offer significant opportunity, but it also presents risks and challenges.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	These risks and challenges include that we may not be able to effectively predict and respond to changing fashion trends and customer preferences, that we may not be able to find desirable locations for new stores, and that we may not be able to effectively manage our future growth.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P4_S3	Addressing these risks could divert our attention from continuing to build on the strengths that we believe have driven the growth of our business, but we believe our focus on brand identity, customer loyalty, a distinctive shopping experience, product development expertise, and company culture will contribute positively to our results.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	How We Assess the Performance of Our Business In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	Net Revenues Net revenues reflect revenues from the sale of our merchandise and from distribution and shipping and handling fees, less returns and discounts.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	Revenues for the Indirect segment reflect revenues from sales to Indirect retailers.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	Revenues for the Direct segment reflect revenues from sales through our full-price and outlet stores, verabradley.com, and our annual outlet sale.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P6_S3	Comparable-Store Sales Comparable-store sales are calculated based upon our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the reporting period.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P6_S4	Remodeled stores are included in comparable-store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales differently than we do.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	As a result, data in this report regarding our comparable-store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other companies.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Non-comparable store sales include sales from stores not included in comparable-store sales.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	Measuring the change in year-over-year comparable-store sales allows us to evaluate how our store base is performing.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	Various factors affect our comparable-store sales, including:
1495320_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	The timing and success of promotional and advertising efforts.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	Gross Profit Gross profit is equal to our net revenues less our cost of sales.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Cost of sales includes the direct cost of purchased and manufactured merchandise, distribution center costs, operations overhead, duty, and all inbound freight costs incurred.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	The components of our reported cost of sales may not be comparable to those of other retail and wholesale companies.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Gross profit can be impacted by changes in volume, operational efficiencies, such as leveraging of fixed costs, promotional activities, such as free shipping, and fluctuations in pricing structures within e-commerce and the annual outlet sale.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	Price changes in the Indirect and Direct channels, excluding e-commerce and the annual outlet sale, have had an insignificant impact.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Prior to calendar year 2006, we sourced the majority of our finished products domestically.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	Today, the significant majority of our products are sourced internationally.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	During this same period, we began direct sourcing of our raw materials and brought management of logistics in-house.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P12_S3	These sourcing changes, along with better cost management, contributed to improvements in gross margin over this period.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our net revenues.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (SG A) SG A expenses fall into three categories: (1) selling; (2) advertising, marketing, and product development; and (3) administrative.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	Selling expenses include Direct business expenses such as store expenses, employee compensation, and store occupancy and supply costs, as well as Indirect business expenses consisting primarily of employee compensation and other expenses associated with sales to Indirect retailers.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	Advertising, marketing, and product development expenses include employee compensation, media costs, creative production expenses, marketing agency fees, new product design costs, public relations expenses, and market research expenses.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P14_S3	A portion of our advertising expenses may be reimbursed by Indirect retailers, and such amount is classified as other income.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P14_S4	Administrative expenses include compensation costs for corporate functions, corporate headquarters occupancy costs, consulting and software expenses, and charitable donations.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P14_S5	SG A expenses increase as the number of stores increases, but not in the same proportion as the associated increase in revenues.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P14_S6	Other Income We support many of our Indirect retailers marketing efforts by distributing certain catalogs and promotional mailers to current and prospective customers.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P14_S7	Our Indirect retailers reimburse us for a portion of the cost to produce these materials.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P14_S8	Reimbursement received is recorded as other income.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P14_S9	The related cost to design, produce, and distribute the catalogs and mailers is recorded as SG A expense.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P14_S10	Operating Income Operating income equals gross profit less SG A expenses plus other income.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P14_S11	Operating income excludes interest income, interest expense, and income taxes.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Income Taxes Prior to October 3, 2010, we were taxed as an S Corporation for federal income tax purposes under Section 1362 of the Internal Revenue Code, and therefore were not subject to federal and state income taxes (subject to exception in a limited number of state and local jurisdictions that do not recognize the S Corporation status).
1495320_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	On October 3, 2010, our S Corporation status automatically terminated and we became subject to corporate-level federal and state income taxes at prevailing corporate rates.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Effective January 1, 2008, we changed our fiscal year to end on the Saturday closest to January 31.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	Fiscal years ended on January 29, 2011 ( fiscal 2011 ), January 30, 2010 ( fiscal 2010 ), and January 31, 2009 ( fiscal 2009 ), and the current fiscal year will end on January 28, 2012 ( fiscal 2012 ).
1495320_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	As a result of this change, fiscal 2009 included activity for more than 52 weeks.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P16_S3	This was a one-time occurrence and did not have a material effect on our results of operations.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P16_S4	See Item 6 of this report for additional information.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	The following tables summarize key components of our consolidated results of operations for the last three fiscal years, both in dollars and as a percentage of our net revenues:
1495320_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	The following tables present net revenues by operating segment, both in dollars and as a percentage of our net revenues, and full-price store data for the last three fiscal years:
1495320_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	(1) Our first full-price store was opened in mid-September 2007.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	These data exclude our outlet stores.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	(2) Comparable-store sales are the net revenues of our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the period.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	Increase or decrease is reported as a percentage of the comparable-store sales for the same period in the prior fiscal year.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	Remodeled stores are included in comparable-store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Average net revenues per gross square foot are calculated by dividing total net revenues for our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the period by total gross square footage for those stores.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net Revenues For fiscal 2011, net revenues increased $77.2 million, or 26.7%, to $366.1 million, from $288.9 million for fiscal 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	For fiscal 2011, net revenues increased $22.1 million, or 11.5%, to $214.9 million, from $192.8 million for fiscal 2010, due primarily to increased sales volume to our Indirect retailers.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P21_S3	The increased sales volume resulted primarily from greater demand for our Signature Collection releases that, in most cases, had more patterns and styles relative to fiscal 2010 releases, increased offerings and sales of non-Signature Collection products, and improved economic conditions.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P21_S4	For fiscal 2011, net revenues increased $55.0 million, or 57.2%, to $151.1 million, from $96.1 million for fiscal 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P21_S5	This growth resulted from a $22.8 million increase in e-commerce revenues due primarily to greater traffic resulting from marketing initiatives, a $22.6 million increase in non-comparable store sales, and a $7.3 million, or 25.8%, increase in comparable-store sales due primarily to increased store traffic.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P21_S6	The number of our stores grew from 27 at the end of fiscal 2010 to 39 at the end of fiscal 2011.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P21_S7	In addition, our annual outlet sale revenues increased by $2.3 million due to an increase in the number of shoppers that attended the sale and higher average product pricing at the sale.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P21_S8	Gross Profit For fiscal 2011, gross profit increased $58.0 million, or 38.4%, to $209.1 million, from $151.1 million for fiscal 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P21_S9	As a percentage of net revenues, gross profit increased to 57.1% for fiscal 2011, from 52.3% for fiscal 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P21_S10	The increase in gross margin was due primarily to increased leverage of fixed costs as a result of the volume growth, improved efficiency in our utilization of raw materials as a result of our expanding outlet store channel, higher average product pricing at the annual outlet sale, and an overall revenue mix shift toward higher margin, retail-store sales.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	For fiscal 2011, SG A expenses increased $46.9 million, or 40.4%, to $163.1 million, from $116.2 million for fiscal 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	As a percentage of net revenues, SG A expenses were 44.5% and 40.2% for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	For fiscal 2011, selling expenses increased $19.9 million, or 36.0%, to $75.3 million, from $55.4 million for fiscal 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	The increase in selling expenses was due primarily to increased store operational costs attributable to new store openings as well as e-commerce and store marketing initiatives to drive increased traffic.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	The increase in selling expenses also resulted from the company holding two product introduction and educational events (or Premieres) for Indirect retailers during fiscal 2011, compared to only one event during fiscal 2010, and from other increased expenses as a result of the increase in net revenues.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	These increases were partially offset by a $1.3 million asset-impairment charge, as further described below, recorded in fiscal 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	No such charge was recorded in fiscal 2011.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P23_S4	For fiscal 2011, advertising, marketing, and product development expenses decreased $1.1 million, or 3.7%, to $28.7 million, from $29.8 million for fiscal 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P23_S5	As a percentage of net revenues, advertising, marketing, and product development expenses were 7.8% and 10.3% for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P23_S6	This decrease resulted primarily from reduced expenses associated with our co-op marketing programs as a result of refining the marketing support for our Indirect retailers.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P23_S7	These reduced expenses were offset in part by increased spending on non-co-op advertising and marketing efforts and by higher employee and other costs associated with our expanded product design capabilities and with the increase in net revenues.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P23_S8	For fiscal 2011, administrative expenses increased $28.1 million, or 90.7%, to $59.0 million, from $30.9 million for fiscal 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P23_S9	As a percentage of net revenues, administrative expenses were 16.1% and 10.7% for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P23_S10	This increase was due primarily to $15.8 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the vesting of restricted-stock awards in connection with our initial public offering as well as $6.1 million of expense associated with bonuses paid to recipients of the restricted-stock awards to satisfy tax obligations.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P23_S11	In addition, we incurred higher corporate personnel and other costs necessary to support our growth as well as increased professional services fees related in part to our transition from a private to a public company.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P23_S12	Other Income For fiscal 2011, other income decreased $3.5 million, or 32.7%, to $7.2 million, from $10.7 million for fiscal 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P23_S13	This decrease was due to the above-discussed refinement of the marketing support for our Indirect retailers, which resulted in decreased reimbursement of our advertising expenses.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Operating Income For fiscal 2011, operating income increased $7.6 million, or 16.6%, to $53.3 million, from $45.7 million for fiscal 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	As a percentage of net revenues, operating income was 14.6% and 15.8% for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	This decrease in operating income as a percentage of net revenues was due primarily to the previously discussed $15.8 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the vesting of restricted-stock awards in connection with our initial public offering and the $6.1 million of expense associated with bonuses paid to recipients of the restricted-stock awards.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P24_S3	Operating income for our business segments is provided below.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P24_S4	Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	For fiscal 2011, operating income increased $19.1 million, or 26.2%, primarily as a result of the previously discussed increase in gross profit.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	This increase was partially offset by increased selling expenses, as previously discussed.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	For fiscal 2011, operating income increased $21.1 million, or 83.7%, primarily as a result of the previously discussed increase in gross profit.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P25_S3	This increase was partially offset by increased selling expenses, as previously discussed.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P25_S4	For fiscal 2011, unallocated expenses increased $32.6 million, or 62.4%, primarily as a result of increased stock-based and bonus compensation expenses, higher corporate personnel and other costs, and increased professional services fees, as previously discussed.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P25_S5	Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense was consistent for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010; a $0.2 million write off of unamortized debt-issuance costs in connection with the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement was offset by lower average borrowing levels during fiscal 2011.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P25_S6	Income Tax Expense For fiscal 2011, we recorded income tax expense of $5.5 million.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P25_S7	This expense was comprised of (1) $6.8 million of expense related to activity during the portion of fiscal 2011 that we were a C Corporation (October 3, 2010, through January 29, 2011) at an effective tax rate of 51.2% and (2) $0.5 million of state taxes related to taxing jurisdictions that did not recognize our previous S Corporation status, offset in part by a one-time deferred tax benefit of $1.8 million recognized upon the termination of our S Corporation status.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P25_S8	Included in tax expense for the portion of the fiscal year that we operated as a C Corporation was $1.2 million related to permanently non-deductible stock-based compensation expense associated with restricted-stock awards that vested in connection with our initial public offering.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P25_S9	For fiscal 2010, our income tax expense of $0.9 million (calculated at an effective rate of 2.0%) was comprised solely of state taxes related to taxing jurisdictions that did not recognize our previous S Corporation status.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P25_S10	The increase in our effective tax rate resulted from our change in tax status.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Net Revenues For fiscal 2010, net revenues increased $50.4 million, or 21.1%, to $288.9 million, from $238.6 million for fiscal 2009.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	For fiscal 2010, net revenues increased $25.4 million, or 15.2%, to $192.8 million, from $167.5 million for fiscal 2009 due primarily to increased sales volume to our Indirect retailers.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	The volume increase resulted from improving economic conditions resulting in increased consumer spending.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P26_S3	For fiscal 2010, net revenues increased $25.0 million, or 35.1%, to $96.1 million, from $71.1 million for fiscal 2009.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P26_S4	The increase resulted from a $19.1 million increase in e-commerce revenues due primarily to greater traffic from marketing initiatives.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P26_S5	In addition, the number of our stores grew from 21 at the end of fiscal 2009 to 27 at the end of fiscal 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P26_S6	Non-comparable store sales increased by $8.4 million and comparable-store sales increased by $5.3 million, or 36.4%.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P26_S7	These increases were offset by a decrease in annual outlet sale revenues of $7.8 million, as we held two outlet sales in fiscal 2009 rather than the traditional one outlet sale.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P26_S8	Gross Profit For fiscal 2010, gross profit increased $28.0 million, or 22.8%, to $151.1 million, from $123.1 million in the comparable prior-year period.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	profit by $25.9 million, and the remaining $2.1 million was due primarily to the improvement in gross margin to 52.3% in fiscal 2010 from 51.6% in fiscal 2009.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	The gross margin improvement of $2.1 million was attributable to better cost management in the Direct business, improved profits from e-commerce related to fulfillment integration, and fewer promotional activities.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	For fiscal 2010, SG A expenses increased $7.0 million, or 6.4%, to $116.2 million, from $109.2 million for fiscal 2009.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P27_S3	As a percentage of net revenues, SG A expenses were 40.2% and 45.8% during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P27_S4	The decrease in SG A expenses as a percentage of net revenues was due to an increase in net revenues without a comparable increase in SG A expenses.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P27_S5	For fiscal 2010, selling expenses increased $4.0 million, or 7.8%, to $55.4 million, from $51.4 million for fiscal 2009.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P27_S6	As a percentage of net revenues, selling expenses were 19.2% and 21.5% during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P27_S7	The increase in selling expenses was due primarily to increased depreciation related to the long-lived asset impairment for three of our stores and to increased store operating costs related to the opening of six new stores in fiscal 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P27_S8	The asset impairment charge of $1.3 million was based on a variety of factors, including anticipated low levels of traffic and low levels of brand awareness around the store locations.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P27_S9	These factors contributed to projected cash flows being less than the carrying amounts for those stores.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P27_S10	These three store locations were among the early openings under our Direct channel strategy.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P27_S11	We continue to refine our site selection process and unit economics for each new store opening by adjusting the assumptions underlying cash flow projections for each store based on historical store performance.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P27_S12	In addition to analyzing store economics, we pay particular attention to the location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies in our site selection process.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	For fiscal 2010, advertising, marketing, and product development expenses decreased $4.5 million, or 13.1%, to $29.8 million, from $34.3 million for fiscal 2009.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	As a percentage of net revenues, advertising, marketing, and product development expenses were 10.3% and 14.4% during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	The decrease was due to a decline in the number of catalogs and direct mailers we produced as a result of lower participation by our Indirect retailers in these programs primarily due to changes in the mix of catalogs and mailers offered and a decrease in other advertising expenses.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P28_S3	For fiscal 2010, administrative expenses increased $7.5 million, or 31.7%, to $30.9 million, from $23.5 million for fiscal 2009.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P28_S4	As a percentage of net revenues, administrative expenses were 10.7% and 9.8% during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P28_S5	The increase in administrative expenses was due primarily to increased corporate infrastructure spending on personnel, owners life insurance, and a modest increase in charitable giving.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P28_S6	Other Income For fiscal 2010, other income decreased $2.5 million, or 19.1%, to $10.7 million, from $13.3 million for fiscal 2009.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P28_S7	The decrease was due to a decline in the participation by our Indirect retailers in our catalogs and direct mailers, which resulted in decreased reimbursement of our advertising expenses.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P28_S8	The decline in participation was due primarily to changes in the mix of catalogs and mailers offered, offset by increased company advertising.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P28_S9	This change did not have a discernable impact on our Indirect business.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Operating Income For fiscal 2010, operating income increased $18.5 million, or 68.1%, to $45.7 million, from $27.2 million for fiscal 2009.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	As a percentage of net revenues, operating income was 15.8% and 11.4% during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	Operating income for our business segments is provided below.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P29_S3	Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	For fiscal 2010, operating income increased $14.5 million, or 25.0%, as a result of $10.4 million from increased sales volume to our Indirect retailers as well as a $4.1 million decrease in SG A expenses.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	The reduction in SG A expenses was due to a reduction in advertising expenses, offset by increased salaries and benefits expenses and other expenses incurred in the period.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	For fiscal 2010, operating income increased $10.4 million, or 69.4%, as a result of $12.2 million additional revenues due to new retail stores opened and growth in e-commerce traffic and $5.4 million of improved gross margin due to improved cost management in the Direct business, offset by $7.2 million of increased SG A expenses.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P30_S3	The increased SG A expenses were due to increased building and depreciation expenses, including the $1.3 million asset impairment of three of our stores, increased salaries and benefits expenses attributable to new store openings, and increased advertising expenses related to e-commerce referral commissions.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P30_S4	For fiscal 2010, unallocated expenses increased $6.4 million, or 13.9%, as a result of $2.4 million of increased salaries and benefit expenses, $2.5 million of increased building and depreciation expenses, $2.5 million of reduced other income due to a decline in the participation by our Indirect retailers in our catalogs and mailers causing decreased reimbursement of our advertising expenses and $4.1 million of increased professional fees and other expenses incurred in the period.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P30_S5	These expense increases were partially offset by a $5.1 million reduction of advertising expenses, primarily as a result of a reduction in spending in anticipation of a continued soft economic environment, and, to a lesser extent, resulting from decreased costs of catalogs and mailers due to the decline in participation by our Indirect retailers.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P30_S6	Interest Expense, Net For fiscal 2010, interest expense decreased $0.9 million, or 36.1%, to $1.6 million, from $2.5 million for fiscal 2009.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P30_S7	This decrease was attributable to lower debt levels along with a lower cost of borrowing, offset by interest income received due to higher average cash balances.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Our business relies on cash flows from operating activities as our primary source of liquidity.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	We also have access to additional liquidity, if needed, through borrowings under our $125.0 million amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	Historically, our primary cash needs have been for merchandise inventories, payroll, store rent, capital expenditures associated with opening new stores, debt repayments, operational equipment, information technology, and quarterly shareholder distributions to cover estimated tax payments.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	The most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, merchandise inventories, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current liabilities.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	We do not believe that the expansion of our Direct business will materially alter the nature and levels of our accounts receivable and inventories, or require materially increased borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement, in the near future.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	We believe that cash flows from operating activities and the availability of borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement or other financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures (including expansion of our Direct business), and debt payments for the foreseeable future.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	Cash Flow Analysis A summary of operating, investing, and financing activities is shown in the following table:
1495320_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation, the effect of changes in assets and liabilities, and tenant-improvement allowances received from landlords under our store leases.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities declined to $58.5 million in fiscal 2011, from $66.0 million in fiscal 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	This decrease was driven primarily by a $17.2 million increase in cash outflows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities and a $5.4 million increase in net deferred tax assets, offset in part by an increase of $15.9 million in stock-based compensation expense.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P34_S3	The increase in cash outflows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from a $30.2 million increase in inventories, partially offset by increased current liabilities related in part to inventory purchases and C Corporation tax obligations.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P34_S4	We brought inventories back to more normalized levels this year after reducing inventory levels last year in response to the weak economic environment.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P34_S5	Net cash provided by operating activities was $66.0 million for fiscal 2010 compared to $50.2 million in fiscal 2009.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P34_S6	In fiscal 2010, net income increased $19.5 million from fiscal 2009 while cash provided by changes in assets and liabilities declined $9.0 million.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for growth related to new store openings, operational equipment, and information technology investments.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	Net cash used in investing activities was $9.9 million in fiscal 2011, reflecting capital expenditures of $11.4 million offset in part by $1.5 million of cash provided as a result of the elimination of a compensating-balance requirement in connection with the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	Capital expenditures of $11.4 million for fiscal 2011 were $5.5 million higher than capital expenditures in fiscal 2010, due primarily to increased investments in new stores, including the opening of twelve stores in fiscal 2011 compared to six stores during fiscal 2010, and incremental investments in information technology and distribution assets.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P35_S3	Net cash used in investing activities was $5.8 million in fiscal 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P35_S4	This was driven by $3.6 million in investments in six new stores along with improvements in e-commerce, $0.4 million in information technology investments, and $1.1 million in production and distribution equipment.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P35_S5	Net cash used in investing activities was $16.4 million in fiscal 2009 driven by $7.2 million in investments in 13 new stores along with improvements in e-commerce, $4.1 million in production and distribution equipment, and $1.6 million in information technology investments, with the remaining amounts used for facility and other improvements.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	Capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 are expected to be approximately $15 million, including the opening of 14 to 16 new stores.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $41.2 million in fiscal 2011, driven primarily by $132.8 million of S Corporation distributions (including the final S Corporation distribution of $106.0 million) and $1.1 million of debt-issuance costs, offset in part by IPO net proceeds of $56.3 million and net borrowings of $36.8 million under the credit agreement or amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	Net cash used in financing activities was $54.4 million in fiscal 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P36_S3	This included $24.5 million in net repayments of borrowings under our credit agreement, $4.3 million in repayments of vendor and related-party debt, and $25.6 million in distributions to our shareholders to fund tax liabilities due to our S Corporation status.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P36_S4	Net cash used in financing activities was $33.0 million in fiscal 2009.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P36_S5	This reflected net repayments of $7.6 million on our credit agreement, $24.1 million of distributions to our shareholders to fund tax liabilities due to our S Corporation status, and $1.0 million in debt-issuance costs paid in connection with the credit agreement.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On October 4, 2010, Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. entered into an agreement to amend and restate its credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, as administrative agent, and certain other lenders.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	The amended and restated credit agreement provides for a revolving credit commitment of $125.0 million and matures on October 3, 2015.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	All borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P37_S3	The credit agreement is also guaranteed by the company.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P37_S4	The credit agreement requires the company to comply with various financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.20 to 1.00 and a leverage ratio of not more than 3.50 to 1.00.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P37_S5	The agreement also contains various other covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of certain indebtedness, liens, investments, acquisitions, and asset sales.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P37_S6	The company was in compliance with these covenants as of January 29, 2011.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	Borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement bear interest at either LIBOR plus the applicable margin (ranging from 1.05% to 2.05%) or the alternate base rate (as defined in the agreement) plus the applicable margin (ranging from 0.05% to 1.05%).
1495320_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	The applicable margin is tied to the company s leverage ratio.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	In addition, the company is required to pay a quarterly facility fee (as defined in the agreement) ranging from 0.20% to 0.45% of the revolving credit commitment.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P38_S3	At January 29, 2011, the weighted-average interest rate on the $66.75 million of outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement was 1.68%.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P38_S4	The company had borrowing availability of $58.25 million under the agreement as of January 29, 2011.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	We enter into long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily debt obligations and non-cancellable operating leases.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	As of January 29, 2011, our contractual cash obligations over the next several periods are as follows:
1495320_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	(1) As of January 29, 2011, we had the following principal amount due under our amended and restated credit agreement: $66.75 million due October 3, 2015.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	Estimated total interest and facility fee payments of $6.7 million, based on our outstanding borrowings and the interest rates in effect under our amended and restated credit agreement as of January 29, 2011, have been excluded.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	(2) We have entered into financing agreements with certain vendors.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	The amounts listed represent the outstanding balances under these agreements.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	(3) Our store leases generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and provide us with the option to renew the leases upon substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	Our future operating lease obligations would change if we were to exercise these options, or if we were to enter into new operating leases.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	(4) Purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchase orders.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosures relating to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	We evaluate our accounting policies, estimates, and judgments on an on-going basis.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P45_S2	We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P45_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P45_S4	We evaluate the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and believe that the following policies and estimates involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position, and are therefore discussed as critical.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	The following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent results of operations.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	Our historical results for the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, however, have not been materially impacted by such variances.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	More information on all of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from the sale of our products is recognized upon customer receipt of the product when collection of the associated receivables is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and ownership and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, which, for e-commerce and most Indirect sales, reflects an estimate of shipments that customers have not yet received.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	The estimate of these shipments is based on shipping terms and historical delivery times.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	Significant changes in shipping terms or delivery times could materially impact our revenues in a given period.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	We reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Merchandise returns are often resalable merchandise and in the Direct business are refunded by issuing the same payment tender of the original purchase and in the Indirect business the customer is issued a credit to its account to apply to outstanding invoices.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	Merchandise exchanges of the same product at the same price are not considered merchandise returns.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	Product returns are often resalable through our annual outlet sale or other channels.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P50_S3	Additionally, we reserve for other potential product credits and for customer shipments not yet received.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	$1.7 million and $1.9 million at January 29, 2011, and January 30, 2010, respectively.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	This represents a reduction to operating income of $1.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	Market is determined based on net realizable value, which includes costs to dispose.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P52_S3	Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excess quantities, and other factors, including the popularity of a pattern or product, in evaluating net realizable value.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	We record valuation adjustments to our inventories, which are reflected in cost of sales, if the cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	This adjustment calculation requires us to make assumptions and estimates, which are based on factors such as merchandise seasonality, historical trends, and estimated sales and inventory levels, including sell-through of remaining units.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	In addition, as part of inventory adjustments, we provide for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from our physical inventory counts.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P53_S3	We perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrink provision accordingly.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P53_S4	Inventory adjustments of $5.1 million and $7.5 million were recorded for these matters as of January 29, 2011, and January 30, 2010, respectively.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P53_S5	These adjustments related primarily to raw materials of discontinued patterns, as we have the ability to move discontinued finished goods through a number of channels, including the annual outlet sale, our website and outlet stores, and through liquidators as needed.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P53_S6	The decrease in the valuation adjustments during fiscal 2011 resulted primarily from our expanding outlet store channel, which we launched in November 2009 and which has enabled us to increase our use of raw materials of discontinued patterns.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Income Taxes Prior to October 3, 2010, we were taxed as an S Corporation for income-tax purposes under Section 1362 of the Internal Revenue Code and therefore were not subject to federal and state income taxes (subject to exception in a limited number of state and local jurisdictions that did not recognize the S Corporation status).
1495320_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	On October 3, 2010, our S Corporation status automatically terminated and we became subject to corporate-level federal and state income taxes at prevailing corporate rates.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P54_S2	As a result of this conversion, effective October 3, 2010, we account for income taxes and the related accounts using the liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P54_S3	Our effective tax rate is based on our pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P54_S4	Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P54_S5	We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained; (2) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	Taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	We believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	Taxing authorities, however, may take a contrary position.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	Our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if, upon final resolution with taxing authorities, we prevail in positions for which we have established reserves, or are required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Valuation of Long-lived Assets Property, plant, and equipment assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	In evaluating an asset for recoverability, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset at the store level, the lowest identifiable level of cash flow, if applicable.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset is less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, usually determined by an estimated discounted cash flow analysis of the asset.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	valuation of long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, our plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results, and projected future cash flows.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	With respect to our stores, we analyze store economics, location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies in our selection process.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	Impairment charges are included in SG A expenses.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	The discounted cash flow models used to estimate the applicable fair values involve numerous estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	Changes to these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the fair value estimates.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P61_S2	The estimates and assumptions critical to the overall fair value estimates include: (1) estimated future cash flow generated at the store level; and (2) discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair values.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P61_S3	These and other estimates and assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and our expectations and may change in the future based on period-specific facts and circumstances.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P61_S4	If economic conditions were to deteriorate, future impairment charges may be required.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	The restricted shares of our common stock granted under the 2010 Restricted Stock Plan were measured at fair value on July 30, 2010, the grant date.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	In the absence of a public trading market, we considered numerous objective and subjective factors, including information provided by an independent valuation firm, to determine our best estimate of the fair value of the restricted shares of our common stock on the grant date.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P62_S2	Our estimate of this stock-based compensation was equivalent to the fair value of our common stock that was ultimately expected to vest.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P62_S3	The stock-based compensation was recognized as compensation expense over the period the restrictions were to lapse and, then, in full upon the initial public offering of our stock.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P62_S4	At the grant date, we estimated a forfeiture rate of zero.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P62_S5	On the grant date, we were a private company with no active public market for our common stock.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P62_S6	Therefore, we determined the estimated per share fair value of our common stock as of July 30, 2010, using a contemporaneous valuation consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (the Practice Aid ).
1495320_11_ITEM7_P62_S7	In conducting this valuation, we considered all objective and subjective factors that we believed to be relevant, including our best estimate of our business condition, prospects, and operating performance at July 30, 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P62_S8	Within this contemporaneous valuation performed by us, a range of factors, assumptions, and methodologies were used.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	condition of and outlook for the handbag, accessories, and luggage industries.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	After considering the information presented by our management, our board of directors rendered its final fair value determination.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P63_S2	For the contemporaneous valuation of our common stock, management estimated, as of July 30, 2010, the valuation date, our enterprise value on a continuing operations basis, using primarily the income and market approaches, both of which are acceptable valuation methods in accordance with the Practice Aid.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P63_S3	The income approach utilized the discounted cash flow ( DCF ) methodology based on our financial forecasts and projections, as detailed below.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P63_S4	The market approach utilized the market multiple methodology based on comparable public companies equity pricing, as detailed below.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	For the DCF methodology, we prepared detailed annual projections of future cash flows through 2024, which we refer to as the discrete projection period.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	annual long-term growth rate and in which the terminal-year cash flow is capitalized at a rate equal to the estimated discount rate less the estimated constant annual long-term growth rate.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	Our projections of future cash flows were based on our estimated net debt-free cash flows and were discounted to the valuation date at an estimate of our weighted-average cost of capital.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	For the market multiple methodology, we determined, as of the valuation date, a range of trading multiples for a group of comparable public companies, based on trailing 12 months adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) and projected future EBITDA and EBIT.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	These multiples were then applied to our actual trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA and EBIT and projected EBITDA and EBIT as of the valuation date.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	When selecting comparable companies, consideration was given to industry similarity, their specific products offered, financial data availability and capital structure.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	We believe that the procedures employed in the DCF and market multiple methodologies are reasonable and consistent with the Practice Aid.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, portions of which became effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2009.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	ASU 2010-06 amended the FASB s authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures to require additional disclosures related to transfers between levels in the hierarchy of fair value measurements.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	The standard did not change how fair values are measured.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P69_S3	In the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011, the Company adopted the effective portions of ASU 2010-06 without any impact on the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_11_ITEM7_P69_S4	Transactions with Related Parties See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, of this report for information regarding transactions with related parties.
1495320_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	under our amended and restated credit agreement, which bear interest at variable rates.
1495320_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The amended and restated credit agreement allows for a revolving credit commitment of $125.0 million, bearing interest at a variable rate, based on either LIBOR plus the applicable margin (ranging from 1.05% to 2.05%) or the alternate base rate (as defined in the agreement) plus the applicable margin (ranging from 0.05% to 1.05%).
1495320_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Assuming the amended and restated credit agreement is fully drawn, each quarter point increase or decrease in the interest rate would change our annual interest expense by approximately $0.3 million.
1495320_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	From time to time, we utilize interest rate swaps to hedge our interest rate risk.
1495320_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We had no open derivative instruments at January 29, 2011.
1495320_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Impact of Inflation Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost.
1495320_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Although it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial.
1495320_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We source a substantial majority of our materials from various suppliers in China and South Korea.
1495320_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Substantially all purchases and sales involving foreign persons are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore we do not hedge using any derivative instruments.
1495320_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Historically, we have not been impacted materially by changes in exchange rates.

1495320_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	Description of the Company Vera Bradley, Inc. was formed as an Indiana corporation on June 23, 2010, for the purpose of reorganizing the corporate structure of Vera Bradley Designs, Inc.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P6_S1	On October 3, 2010, the shareholders of Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. contributed all of their shares of Class A Voting Common Stock and Class B Non-Voting Common Stock of Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. to Vera Bradley, Inc. in return for shares of Vera Bradley, Inc.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P6_S2	Class A Voting Common Stock and Class B Non-Voting Common Stock on a one-for-one basis.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P6_S3	In addition, effective October 3, 2010, Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. converted from an S Corporation to a C Corporation for income-tax purposes.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P6_S4	Further, on October 18, 2010, Vera Bradley, Inc. recapitalized all of its Class A Voting Common Stock and Class B Non-Voting Common Stock into a single class of common stock and effectuated a 35.437-for-1 stock split of all outstanding shares of its common stock.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P6_S5	These events collectively are referred to as the Reorganization.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P6_S6	As a result of the Reorganization, Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Vera Bradley, Inc.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P6_S7	Except where context requires or where otherwise indicated, the terms Company and Vera Bradley refer to Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. and its subsidiaries before the Reorganization and to Vera Bradley, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Vera Bradley Designs, Inc., after the Reorganization.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P6_S8	All historical common stock and per share common stock information has been changed to reflect the stock split.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	Vera Bradley is a leading designer, producer, marketer, and retailer of stylish, highly functional accessories for women.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P7_S1	The Company s products include a wide offering of handbags, accessories, and travel and leisure items.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P7_S2	The Company generates net revenues by selling products through two reportable segments: Indirect and Direct.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P7_S3	The Indirect business consists of sales of Vera Bradley products to approximately 3,300 independent retailers, substantially all of which are located in the United States, as well as select national retailers and third-party e-commerce sites.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P7_S4	The Direct business consists of sales of Vera Bradley products through the Company s full-price stores, outlet stores, verabradley.com, and an annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P7_S5	As of January 29, 2011, the Company operated 35 full-price stores and four outlet stores.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P8_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P8_S1	The Company has eliminated intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P8_S2	The Company s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P9_S0	Comprehensive Income The Company has excluded the Statements of Comprehensive Income from these consolidated financial statements because comprehensive income equals net income.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P10_S0	Unaudited Pro Forma Income Information Prior to the Reorganization, the Company was taxed as an S Corporation for purposes of federal and state income taxes.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P10_S1	Accordingly, each of the Company s then-shareholders was required to include his or her portion of the Company s taxable income or loss on his or her federal and state income tax returns.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P10_S2	As part of the Reorganization, effective October 3, 2010, the Company s S Corporation status automatically terminated and the Company became subject to corporate-level federal and state income taxes at prevailing corporate rates.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P10_S3	The unaudited pro forma income information gives effect to an adjustment for income tax expense as if the Company had been a C Corporation at the beginning of each period presented at an assumed combined federal, state, and local income tax rate of 41.7% for the period from January 31, 2010, through October 2, 2010, and 40% for the fiscal years ended January 30, 2010, and January 31, 2009.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P10_S4	These rates approximate the calculated effective tax rates for the periods presented.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P11_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the Company s assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosures relating to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P11_S1	Significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include the valuation of inventories, accounts receivable valuation allowances, sales return allowances, and the useful lives of assets for depreciation or amortization.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P11_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P11_S3	The Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents represent cash on hand, deposits with financial institutions, and investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	At January 31, 2008, the Company was in a bank overdraft position with one financial institution.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P13_S1	The bank overdraft was to have been funded by the Company s lender by increasing the financial-institution debt and is classified in the financing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as Change in bank overdraft.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	Restricted Cash At January 30, 2010, the Company maintained $1.5 million in an account with one of its lenders as a compensating balance in connection with the credit agreement entered into during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P14_S1	In October 2010, as part of the amendment and restatement of the Company s credit agreement (see Note 5), this compensating-balance requirement was eliminated.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P14_S2	Concentration of Credit Risk The Company maintains nearly all of its cash and cash equivalents with one financial institution.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P14_S3	The Company monitors the credit standing of this financial institution on a regular basis.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P15_S1	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P15_S2	Market is determined based on net realizable value, which includes costs to dispose.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P15_S3	Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excess quantities, and other factors, including the popularity of a pattern or product, in evaluating net realizable value.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are carried at cost and depreciated or amortized over the following estimated useful lives using the straight-line method:
1495320_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the asset or the lease term.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P17_S1	Lease terms typically range from five to ten years.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	When a decision is made to abandon property, plant, and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life, depreciation or amortization estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P18_S1	At the time of disposal, the cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting loss is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	Property, plant, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P19_S1	The reviews are conducted at the lowest identifiable level of cash flows.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the property, plant, and equipment are less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, as further defined below in Fair Value of Financial Instruments.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	Assets under construction are not depreciated or amortized until the asset is substantially complete and placed in service.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P21_S1	Interest is capitalized during periods of construction and depreciated or amortized over the estimated useful lives of the applicable assets.

1495320_11_ITEM8_P23_S2	Software costs that do not meet capitalization criteria are expensed as incurred.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Revenue from the sale of the Company s products is recognized upon customer receipt of the product when collection of the associated receivables is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and ownership and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, which, for e-commerce and most Indirect sales, reflects an estimate of shipments that customers have not yet received.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P24_S1	The estimate of these shipments is based on shipping terms and historical delivery times.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	Included in net revenues are product sales to Direct and Indirect customers, including amounts billed to customers for shipping fees.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	Costs related to shipping of product are classified in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P25_S2	Net revenues exclude sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	Historical experience provides the Company the ability to estimate reasonably the amount of product sales that customers will return.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	Product returns are often resalable through the Company s annual outlet sale or other channels.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P26_S2	The Company accounts for anticipated returns by reducing net revenues, cost of sales, and accounts receivable and increasing inventories, essentially reversing the effects of the original sales transactions.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P26_S3	Additionally, the Company reserves for other potential product credits granted to Indirect retailers.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P26_S4	The returns and credits reserve and the related activity for each fiscal year presented were as follows (in thousands):
1495320_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific identification and believes that collections of receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, are reasonably assured.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P27_S1	The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $266,000 and $290,000 at January 29, 2011, and January 30, 2010, respectively.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes material costs, freight, inventory shrinkage, payroll, benefit costs, operating lease costs, duty, and other operating expenses, including depreciation of the Company s distribution center, warehouse and manufacturing facilities, and equipment.

1495320_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	The Company has leases that contain rent holidays and predetermined, fixed escalations of minimum rentals.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P29_S1	For each of these leases, the Company recognizes the related rent expense on a straight-line basis commencing on the date of initial possession of the leased property.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P29_S2	The Company records the difference between the recognized rent expense and the amount payable under the lease as a deferred lease credit.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Company receives tenant-improvement allowances from some of the landlords of its leased properties.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P30_S1	These allowances generally are in the form of cash received by the Company from its landlords as part of the negotiated lease terms.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P30_S2	The Company records each tenant-improvement allowance as a deferred credit and amortizes the allowance on a straight-line basis as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease, commencing on the possession date.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Company charges costs associated with the opening of new stores to selling, general, and administrative expenses as incurred.

1495320_11_ITEM8_P32_S1	Under these provisions, for its awards of restricted stock and restricted-stock units, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the respective award.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P32_S2	The Company recognizes this expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P32_S3	For restricted-stock awards granted prior to its initial public offering, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense over the period the restrictions were to lapse and, then, in full upon the initial public offering.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P32_S4	Other Income and Advertising Costs The Company expenses advertising costs at the time the promotion first appears in media, in stores, or on the website, and includes those costs in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P32_S5	The Company classifies the related recovery of a portion of such costs from Indirect retailers as other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

1495320_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	The Company did not elect hedge accounting and marked these derivative instruments to market, resulting in an insignificant liability and insignificant expense included in other accrued liabilities and selling, general, and administrative expenses as of and for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P35_S2	The interest rate swap agreements had a total notional amount of $20 million, of which $10 million expired on February 2, 2010, and $10 million was terminated on November 8, 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P35_S3	The Company recognized insignificant losses upon this expiration and termination of these agreements in the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified using the following hierarchy, which is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation as of the measurement date:
1495320_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	The classification of fair value measurements within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	The carrying amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, receivables, other current assets, debt, and payables as of January 29, 2011, and January 30, 2010, approximated their fair values.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	Income Taxes Prior to October 3, 2010, the Company was taxed as an S Corporation for income-tax purposes under Section 1362 of the Internal Revenue Code and therefore was not subject to federal and state income taxes (subject to exception in a limited number of state and local jurisdictions that did not recognize the S Corporation status).
1495320_11_ITEM8_P39_S1	On October 3, 2010, the Company s S Corporation status automatically terminated and the Company became subject to corporate-level federal and state income taxes at prevailing corporate rates.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P39_S2	As a result of this conversion, effective October 3, 2010, the Company accounts for income taxes and the related accounts using the liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P39_S3	Under this method, the Company accrues income taxes payable or refundable and recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the GAAP and tax bases of assets and liabilities.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P39_S4	The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse, and recognizes the effect of a change in enacted rates in the period of enactment.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P39_S5	The Company establishes assets and liabilities for uncertain positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns, using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P39_S6	The Company includes in income tax expense any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, portions of which became effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2009.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P40_S1	ASU 2010-06 amended the FASB s authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures to require additional disclosures related to transfers between levels in the hierarchy of fair value measurements.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P40_S2	The standard did not change how fair values are measured.
1495320_11_ITEM8_P40_S3	In the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011, the Company adopted the effective portions of ASU 2010-06 without any impact on the consolidated financial statements.

1495320_11_ITEM10_P22_S1	See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions Relationships Among Members of our Board of Directors and Management in Item 13 of this report.
1495320_11_ITEM10_P23_S0	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock and to provide us copies of these reports.
1495320_11_ITEM10_P23_S1	Based solely on a review of the copies of these reports furnished to us and written representations that no other reports were required to be filed, we believe that all filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors, and beneficial owners of greater than 10% of our common stock have been complied with during the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011, except that the Form 3 for Robert J.

1495320_11_ITEM11_P0_S0	This is a presentation of the material elements of compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, and other executive officers identified in the Summary Compensation Table (collectively, our named executive officers) who served in those positions during the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P0_S1	To assist in understanding our named executive officer compensation program, we have included a discussion of our compensation policies and decisions for periods before and after fiscal 2011 where relevant.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P1_S0	Our compensation program is designed to provide some common standards throughout the company.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P1_S1	Therefore, much of what is disclosed below applies to executives in general and is not limited to our named executive officers.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P1_S2	Prior to the completion of our initial public offering, our board of directors had overall responsibility for the compensation program for our named executive officers.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P1_S3	Since the completion of the offering, the compensation committee of our board of directors has had overall responsibility for the compensation program for our named executive officers.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P1_S4	Members of the compensation committee are appointed by the board of directors.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P1_S5	Our executive compensation program is designed to encourage our named executive officers to focus on building shareholder value, maximizing growth and profitability, and continuing to maintain our unique culture and build our strong brand.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P1_S6	We strive to provide our named executive officers with a compensation package that is competitive within our industry.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P1_S7	Our objective is to provide a competitive total rewards compensation package to attract and retain key personnel and drive effective results.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P1_S8	Our executive compensation program provides for the following main elements:
1495320_11_ITEM11_P2_S0	a comprehensive benefits package that is available to all of our employees.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P2_S1	A detailed description of these components is provided below.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P3_S0	Elements of Our Executive Compensation Program Base Salary.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P3_S1	We utilize base salary as the primary means of providing compensation for performing the essential elements of an executive s job.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P3_S2	We believe our base salaries are set at levels that allow us to attract and retain executives in competitive markets.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P3_S3	Our annual incentive compensation, in the form of an annual cash bonus, is intended to compensate our named executive officers for meeting our corporate objectives and, for some of our named executive officers, individual performance objectives, and to incentivize our named executive officers to meet these objectives.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P3_S4	These objectives may be both financial and non-financial and may be based on company or individual performance.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P3_S5	The compensation committee typically sets a target level at which the full 100% bonus can be earned and then also sets a slightly lower target at which a partial bonus can be earned if the objective is almost achieved, as well as a higher target at which a greater-than-100% bonus can be earned for exceeding the 100% bonus target.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P4_S0	including our named executive officers, with those of the company s owners.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P4_S1	We anticipate that long-term incentive compensation will continue to be an integral part of our compensation program.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P4_S2	Our benefits, such as our basic health benefits, 401(k) plan, life insurance, paid time off, matching charitable gifts program, tuition reimbursement, and discounts on certain company products, are intended to provide a stable array of support to our employees and their families throughout various stages of their careers, and these core benefits are provided to all employees.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P4_S3	The 401(k) plan allows participants to defer amounts of their annual compensation before taxes, up to the cap set by the Internal Revenue Code, which was $16,500 per person for calendar year 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P4_S4	Employees elective deferrals are immediately vested and nonforfeitable upon contribution to the 401(k) plan.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P4_S5	We currently provide matching contributions equal to 50% of an employee s individual contribution, up to a maximum of 10% of the participant s annual salary and subject to certain other limits.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P5_S0	Determining the Amount of Each Element of Compensation Overview.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P5_S1	The amount of each element of our compensation program is determined by our compensation committee on an annual basis taking into consideration our results of operations, long and short-term goals, individual goals, the competitive market for our named executive officers, and general economic factors.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P5_S2	Our approach has been to provide executives with a base salary and an annual bonus opportunity that generally are competitive with the level of those elements paid for comparable positions at comparable companies.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P6_S0	Once the level of compensation is set for the year, the compensation committee may revisit its decisions if there are material developments during the year, such as promotions, changes in responsibilities, or other factors, that may warrant a change in compensation.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P6_S1	After the year is over, the compensation committee reviews the performance of the named executive officers to determine the achievement of annual incentive compensation targets and to assess the overall functioning of our compensation plans against our goals.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P6_S2	In fiscal 2010, our board of directors engaged a compensation consultant, Towers Watson (formerly known as Towers Perrin, prior to its merger with Watson Wyatt), to provide data and recommendations regarding our compensation program in order to remain competitive with compensation programs at other companies with which we may compete for talent.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P6_S3	Towers Watson s final report and recommendations were presented in fiscal 2011.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P7_S0	The level of base pay for each named executive officer prior to fiscal 2011 was not determined through formal benchmarking, but rather through an annual assessment of the individual factors described in Overview above.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P7_S1	Our objective going forward, which we achieved for fiscal 2011, is generally to be within the competitive range of the market median, on average, for base salaries of our executive officers, including our named executive officers.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P7_S2	In its review of our levels of base salary as compared to the market, Towers Watson gathered base salary data from Watson Wyatt s Top Management Database, which was adjusted to the company s revenue size.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P7_S3	We did not select a specific peer group, nor did we review data from specific companies (nor were we aware of the identities of the specific component companies included in the database), but rather we used market pay data for the non-durable goods manufacturer segment within the Watson Wyatt database.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P7_S4	The base salary data that was gathered was effective as of April 1, 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P8_S0	We consider a range of /-15% around the market median (50 th percentile) to be competitive but still capable of recognizing differences among executives.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P8_S1	As a result of our consultant s review, the board of directors decided to adjust Mr. Ray s base salary (which, for fiscal 2010, was 25% below the 50 th percentile) for fiscal 2011 so that his base salary was at the 50 th percentile of chief executive officers of the surveyed companies.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P8_S2	Mr. Blade s fiscal 2011 base salary is within the competitive range of the targeted market 50 th percentile.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P8_S3	Notwithstanding our objective of bringing the base salaries of our executive officers, on average, within the competitive range of the market median, David R. Traylor, our current Treasurer and former Chief Financial Officer, and Ms. Colby received modest base salary increases for fiscal 2011 in recognition of their performance in fiscal 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P9_S0	the prior year; however, for fiscal 2012, her base salary rate was reduced to $275,002, effective February 6, 2011.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P9_S1	Mr. Wojewuczki received a base salary increase in fiscal 2011 in connection with his promotion to Executive Vice President Operations.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P9_S2	Prior to April 29, 2010, Mr. Wojewuczki was our Vice President Operations.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P9_S3	The following table shows base salary rate increases for each of our named executive officers for fiscal 2011:
1495320_11_ITEM11_P10_S0	(5) Prior to April 29, 2010, Ms. Nichols s position was Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P11_S0	(6) Ms. Nichols s base salary rate was reduced to $275,002, effective February 6, 2011, in connection with her above-mentioned transition from our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer to our Executive Vice President Philanthropy and Community Relations.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P12_S0	Our compensation committee establishes the goals for our Annual Incentive Bonus Program on an annual basis, and distributions are typically made after the end of each fiscal year after the compensation committee has determined if the goals have been achieved.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P12_S1	The compensation committee, however, has the authority to modify a bonus structure during the year, as it deems appropriate.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P13_S0	In its review of our levels of bonus compensation as compared to the market, Towers Watson gathered target bonus values from Towers Perrin s Executive Compensation Database, which was adjusted to the company s revenue size.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P13_S1	We did not select a specific peer group, nor did we review data from specific companies (nor were we aware of the identities of the specific component companies included in the database), but rather we used market pay data for the general industries segment within the Towers Perrin database.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P13_S2	The bonus information that was gathered was effective as of April 1, 2010.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P13_S3	Consistent with our newly adopted company-wide approach of targeting annual incentive opportunities near the market 60 th percentile for all employees, the board of directors decided to adjust the annual target bonus opportunity in fiscal 2011 for our named executive officers generally to approach more closely the 60 th percentile of comparable positions at comparable companies within the database.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P14_S0	Mr. Ray s fiscal 2010 target bonus opportunity was significantly below the 60 th percentile for chief executive officers in the survey data.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P14_S1	Mr. Ray s target bonus opportunity for fiscal 2011 was set at 60% of his fiscal 2011 base salary (compared to a previous opportunity of 62.5% of his fiscal 2010 base salary).
1495320_11_ITEM11_P14_S2	The board of directors decided not to increase Mr. Ray s annual target bonus opportunity to the 60 th percentile (which would have resulted in a target bonus opportunity of 90% of his fiscal 2011 base salary) because his recently increased base salary had already resulted in a significant increase in Mr. Ray s fiscal 2011 annual target bonus opportunity from his fiscal 2010 annual target bonus opportunity.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P14_S3	Mr. Blade s fiscal 2011 target bonus opportunity of 50% of his fiscal 2011 base salary corresponds with our company-wide approach of aligning target bonuses with the market 60 th percentile.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P14_S4	Notwithstanding our general company-wide approach of bringing the annual target bonus opportunities of our named executive officers nearer to the market 60 th percentile, Mr. Traylor s fiscal 2011 target bonus opportunity was increased to 50% of his fiscal 2011 base salary (from a previous bonus opportunity of 37.5% of his fiscal 2010 base salary), which is above the 60 th percentile for his position.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P14_S5	However, the board of directors determined this increase was appropriate based on the experience Mr. Traylor brings to the company as a result of having formerly served as the company s chief financial officer.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P14_S6	In accordance with our company-wide approach, Ms. Nichols s and Ms. Colby s fiscal 2011 target bonus opportunities were reduced to 50% of their fiscal 2011 base salaries (from a previous bonus opportunity of 62.5% of their fiscal 2010 base salaries), with their maximum opportunities unchanged at 75% of base salary.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P14_S7	In connection with his promotion to Executive Vice President Operations and in accordance with our company-wide approach, Mr. Wojewuczki s fiscal 2011 target bonus opportunity was set at 50% of his fiscal 2011 base salary.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P14_S8	Bonus payouts for fiscal 2011 were determined based 50% on company-wide net revenues and 50% on operating income performance.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P14_S9	Our board of directors established the following company-wide net revenue and operating income goals for fiscal 2011: a threshold of $289 million for company-wide net revenues and $47.8 million for operating income; a target of $324 million for company-wide net revenues and $56.2 million for operating income; and a maximum of $373 million for company-wide net revenues and $64.6 million for operating income.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P14_S10	As a result of positive company performance in a better-than-expected economic environment, for fiscal 2011, company-wide net revenues were $366.1 million and operating income, as adjusted, was $75.2 million.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P14_S11	The following table sets forth each named executive officer s threshold, target, and maximum annual bonus opportunity for fiscal 2011, as well as the bonus levels as a percentage of each officer s fiscal 2011 eligible earnings:
1495320_11_ITEM11_P15_S0	(1) Eligible earnings are defined as gross wages earned under regular employment status during the fiscal year, excluding any incentive payments and taxable fringe benefits.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P16_S0	Beginning in fiscal 2012, annual incentive compensation will be paid under the 2010 Equity and Incentive Plan (the 2010 Plan ), described further in 2010 Equity and Incentive Plan below.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P17_S0	In fiscal 2010 and prior years, we did not have a plan or arrangement under which our named executive officers were granted options or other equity awards.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P17_S1	In order to retain key executives and provide a vehicle for executive ownership, on July 30, 2010, our board of directors approved our 2010 Restricted Stock Plan and granted to our named executive officers, certain of our employees, and our non-employee directors a one-time grant of restricted shares of our common stock.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P17_S2	The total number of restricted shares granted was 1,095,003 and included grants to our named executive officers, as follows: Michael C. Ray 155,923 shares; Jeffrey A. Blade 106,311 shares; David R. Traylor 106,311 shares; Jill A. Nichols 106,311 shares; Kimberly F. Colby 106,311 shares; and Matthew C. Wojewuczki 106,311 shares.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P17_S3	The size of each individual restricted share grant was based primarily on a combination of internal pay equity considerations, overall dilution of current ownership, and our lack of any equity incentive compensation prior thereto.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P17_S4	We also reviewed, solely as a reference point and not for benchmarking purposes, market data on long-term incentive opportunities within the general industries segment of the Towers Perrin Executive Compensation Database.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P18_S0	The restricted shares were scheduled to vest on the first anniversary of the grant date.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P18_S1	Vesting of the restricted shares was accelerated upon completion of our initial public offering.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P18_S2	Recipients of restricted shares made Section 83(b) elections and were each paid an additional cash bonus by us in the amount of the required tax withholding obligation on the restricted shares and the expected tax obligation on the cash bonus, as follows: $839,908 for Michael C. Ray; and $572,665 for each of Jeffrey A. Blade, David R. Traylor, Jill A. Nichols, Kimberly F. Colby, and Matthew C. Wojewuczki.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P19_S0	In connection with our initial public offering, our board of directors and our shareholders approved the 2010 Plan, which allows us to provide a variety of different types of incentive awards (including annual and long-term incentive awards) to our executives and other employees.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P19_S1	The 2010 Plan permits us to issue stock options, restricted-stock units, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, performance units, performance shares, and cash incentive awards to eligible employees (including our named executive officers), directors, and advisors, as determined by the compensation committee.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P19_S2	For more details regarding the 2010 Plan, see 2010 Equity and Incentive Plan below.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P20_S0	In connection with our initial public offering, we awarded an aggregate of 56,675 restricted-stock units to our employees.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P20_S1	The number of restricted-stock units awarded to each employee was determined based on the employee s years of service with the company and ranged from 25 to 100 units per employee.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P20_S2	The restricted-stock units were granted under the 2010 Plan, vest on the second anniversary of the grant date, and are subject to forfeiture during the vesting period if an employee is no longer employed by us.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P20_S3	We do not have any formal severance, change in control, or employment agreements or arrangements with our named executive officers (other than Mr. Blade).
1495320_11_ITEM11_P21_S0	Severance arrangements with executives have traditionally been determined on a case-by-case basis.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P21_S1	We have a general severance policy for employees that provides for one week of pay for each year of service with us, with a minimum total payment of 2 weeks of pay, in the event of an involuntary termination of the employee by us.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P21_S2	The board of directors is considering adopting a more formal severance plan for executives going forward.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P21_S3	Mr. Blade s offer letter provides that, in the event he is terminated by us without just cause (as defined in his offer letter), he will be entitled to a severance payment equal to one year s base salary and a pro-rata bonus for the portion of the year prior to his termination, to the extent that a bonus would be payable for the year based on company performance.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P22_S0	The 2010 Plan permits the potential acceleration of outstanding awards in the event of an involuntary termination of employment of an executive in connection with a change in control, as defined in the 2010 Plan, in accordance with the applicable award agreements.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P23_S0	In the review and establishment of our compensation programs, we consider, among other factors, the anticipated accounting and tax implications to us and our executives.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P23_S1	Following the completion of our initial public offering, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code may impose a limit on the amount of compensation that we may deduct in any one year with respect to our chief executive officer and each of our next three most highly compensated executive officers other than the chief financial officer, unless specific and detailed criteria are satisfied.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P24_S0	Performance-based compensation, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, is fully deductible if the programs are approved by shareholders and meet other requirements.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P24_S1	We will seek to maintain flexibility in compensating our executives in a manner designed to promote our corporate goals, and therefore we have not adopted a policy requiring all compensation to be deductible.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P24_S2	Our compensation committee will assess the impact of Section 162(m) on our compensation practices and determine what further action, if any, is appropriate.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P25_S0	The 2010 Plan allows us to provide compensation that meets the deductibility requirements of Section 162(m).
1495320_11_ITEM11_P25_S1	Because of our recently completed initial public offering, however, compensation under 2010 Plan is not subject to Section 162(m) until the earliest to occur of (i) the expiration of the 2010 Plan, (ii) an amendment of the 2010 Plan that results in a material modification of the 2010 Plan, (iii) the issuance of all shares of our common stock that have been reserved for issuance under the 2010 Plan, or (iv) our 2014 annual meeting of shareholders.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P26_S0	Role of Executives in Executive Compensation Decisions Our compensation committee generally seeks input from Mr. Ray when discussing the performance and compensation levels of the other named executive officers.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P26_S1	The compensation committee also works with Mr. Ray, Mr. Blade, and the head of our human resources department in evaluating the financial, accounting, tax, and retention implications of our various compensation programs.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P26_S2	Neither Mr. Ray, Mr. Blade, nor any of our other executives participates in deliberations relating to his or her own compensation.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P26_S3	Fiscal 2012 Compensation Actions On March 29, 2011, we granted restricted stock units to certain executives, including our named executive officers, in the following quantities: Michael C. Ray 16,623 units; Jeffrey A. Blade 4,570 units; David R. Traylor 2,418 units; Jill A. Nichols 3,989 units; Kimberly F. Colby 5,498 units; and Matthew C. Wojewuczki 5,090 units.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P26_S4	These restricted stock units vest and settle in shares of our common stock, on a one-for-one basis, in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P26_S5	The applicable award agreement also provides that the units shall vest immediately upon the later of (i) the occurrence of a change in control, as defined in the agreement, or (ii) the recipient s termination other than for cause during the time period beginning three months prior to the public announcement of a proposed change in control and ending twelve months after a change in control.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P27_S0	Effective March 13, 2011, the base salary rates of the following named executive officers increased to the following amounts: Michael C. Ray $576,446; Jeffrey A. Blade $361,634; Jill A. Nichols $282,932; Kimberly F. Colby $393,562; and Matthew C. Wojewuczki $367,692.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P27_S1	Effective May 2012, in connection with Mr. Traylor s transition from Vice President Finance to Treasurer, his base salary rate will decrease to $205,998.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P28_S0	Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation Historically, compensation decisions for our executive officers were made by our board of directors as a whole and by certain officers and employees not on our board of directors at the time such decisions were made, including Michael C.

1495320_11_ITEM11_P49_S2	Our named executive officers (other than Mr. Blade) are not specifically entitled to any payments upon termination of employment or upon a change in control.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P50_S0	been determined on a case-by-case basis in the past.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P50_S1	However, we maintain an informal general severance policy that provides all employees, including our named executive officers, with one week of pay for each year of service with the company, with a minimum total payment of 2 weeks pay, in the event of an involuntary termination of the employee by the company.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P50_S2	Mr. Blade s offer letter provides that, in the event he is terminated by us without just cause (as defined in his offer letter), he will be entitled to a severance payment equal to one year s base salary and a pro-rata bonus for the portion of the year prior to his termination, to the extent that a bonus would be payable for the year based on company performance.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P50_S3	The following table shows the value of severance benefits that would be payable in a lump sum to each of our named executive officers under this formula, assuming an involuntary termination of employment, other than for good cause, as of January 29, 2011:
1495320_11_ITEM11_P51_S0	Compensation and Risk We have, with the assistance of our board s compensation consultant, evaluated the risk profile of our compensation policies and practices and concluded that they do not motivate imprudent risk taking.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P51_S1	In our evaluation, we reviewed our employee compensation structures and noted numerous factors and design elements that manage and mitigate risk without diminishing the incentive nature of the compensation, including: a unique and strong company culture that attracts passionate and motivated employees who are excited about our products and our brand (as opposed to being motivated by purely financial considerations); a balanced mix between cash and equity and annual and longer-term incentives under our executive compensation program; the large percentage ownership of our shares by senior management, which ensures that their interests are aligned with the long-term interests of the company and our shareholders; reasonable limits on annual incentive awards (as determined by a review of our current business plan); with respect to annual incentive awards, a balanced mix of performance measures and linear payouts between target levels; and subjective considerations (including a review of individual performance) and discretion in compensation decisions, which limit the influence of formulae or objective factors on excessive risk taking.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P51_S2	We also reviewed our compensation programs for certain design features that may have the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking, including: over-weighting towards annual incentives, highly leveraged payout curves, unreasonable thresholds, and steep payout cliffs at certain performance levels that may encourage short-term business decisions to meet payout thresholds.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P51_S3	We concluded that our compensation programs do not include such elements.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P51_S4	In addition, we analyzed our overall enterprise risks and how compensation programs may impact individual behavior in a manner that could exacerbate these enterprise risks.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P51_S5	In view of these analyses, we concluded that we have a balanced pay and performance program that does not encourage excessive risk-taking that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.
1495320_11_ITEM11_P52_S0	In connection with our initial public offering, we approved the Vera Bradley, Inc. 2010 Equity and Incentive Plan (referred to below as the 2010 Plan).
1495320_11_ITEM11_P52_S1	The principal purposes of the 2010 Plan are to optimize the profitability and growth of the company through short-term and long-term incentives that are consistent with the company s objectives and that link participants interests to those of the company s shareholders; to give participants an incentive for excellence in individual performance; to promote teamwork among participants; and to give the company a significant advantage in attracting and retaining key employees, directors, and consultants.

Michael Miller 35,437 shares; Robert J. Hall 35,437 shares; and John Kyees 17,719 shares.

1495320_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	We believe enthusiasm for our brand inspires repeat purchases and helps us expand our customer base.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	Our customers often purchase our products as gifts for family members and friends, who, in turn, become loyal customers.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P23_S3	Our product development team combines an understanding of consumer preferences with a knowledge of color, fashion, and style trends to design our products.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P23_S4	Our highly creative design associates utilize a disciplined product design process that seeks to maximize the productivity of our product releases and drive consumer demand.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P23_S5	We offer our products through a diverse choice of shopping options across channels that are intimate, highly shop-able, fun, and characteristic of our brand.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P23_S6	Whether they are at a Vera Bradley store, a specialty retail store, or verabradley.com, we believe consumers have an opportunity to find the brand in places that match their unique shopping interests.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P23_S7	Our multi-channel distribution model enables us to maximize brand exposure and customer access to our products.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P23_S8	Our Indirect business consists of an established and diverse network of over 3,300 specialty retailers.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P23_S9	This channel of gift, apparel and accessories, travel, and other specialty retailers, located throughout the United States, provides a strong foundation for our growth.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P23_S10	Our Indirect retailers include some of the brand s strongest advocates, and their passion has been instrumental in the development of our brand.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	Our stores provide a shopping experience that is uniquely Vera Bradley.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	We bring the Vera Bradley brand to life in our stores through visual presentation of our wide range of product offerings, the stylish, inviting d cor of our stores, and personalized service from our friendly and knowledgeable sales associates.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	We believe the distinctive shopping experience and personalized service encourage repeat visits and multiple purchases.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	We were founded in 1982 by two friends, Barbara Bradley Baekgaard and Patricia Miller, who built our company around their passion for design and commitment to customer service.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	We believe our founders created a unique company culture that attracts passionate and motivated employees who are excited about our products and our brand.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	Our employees share our founders commitment to Vera Bradley customers.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P25_S3	We believe that a fun, friendly, and welcoming work environment fosters creativity and collaboration and that, by empowering our employees to become personally involved in product design, testing, and marketing, they become passionate and devoted brand advocates.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our senior management team led by Michael C. Ray, our Chief Executive Officer, has extensive experience across a diverse range of disciplines in product design, merchandising, marketing, store development, supply chain management, and finance.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	The current management team has been instrumental in the development and execution of our long-term strategies.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P26_S2	We believe there are significant opportunities to expand our business and increase our net revenues and net income through the execution of the following growth strategies: Grow in Underpenetrated Markets.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P26_S3	Our historic growth focused primarily on the eastern United States, and accordingly, the Vera Bradley brand is most recognized in that region.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P26_S4	In recent years, we have successfully expanded our Direct and Indirect channels in key developing markets, including in the Midwest and Southwest.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P26_S5	In addition, in fiscal 2012 we expanded internationally by entering the Japanese market.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P26_S6	We believe the success of our expansion efforts is a testament to the strength and portability of our brand and the power of our multi-channel distribution capabilities.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P26_S7	We intend to utilize these strengths to further penetrate our existing markets and successfully expand our business into other foreign markets and relatively underpenetrated U.S. markets.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	We plan to expand our retail presence in the United States by opening new stores.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	We believe that the market in the United States can support at least 300 Vera Bradley full-price stores.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	We plan to open 14 to 20 new stores annually during each of the next five fiscal years.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S3	Drive Comparable-Store Sales and Our E-Commerce Business.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S4	We have several ongoing initiatives to drive comparable-store sales growth, including focusing on store-level merchandising programs and enhancing in-store customer service and selling capabilities.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S5	As a key element of our Direct channel strategy, we intend to grow our e-commerce business through focused marketing efforts, online merchandising initiatives, and social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S6	We believe our retail and e-commerce businesses are complementary and facilitate frequent contact with our customers.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S7	We design products to accessorize a woman s life and believe this core competence serves as a platform for growth within and beyond our current product lines.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S8	We have expanded our product offerings to include new line extensions, such as focused gift and special occasion offerings, and brand extensions, such as our paper and stationery collection.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S9	We believe that opportunities exist to accessorize a woman s life through complementary product collections that fit within our positioning as a lifestyle brand.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S10	Within each season, we generally introduce three to five patterns.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S11	These patterns are incorporated into the designs of a wide range of products, including handbags, accessories, and travel and leisure items, that are part of the core seasonal release.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S12	These product assortments each season, can be classic styles, updates to older designs, or new product introductions.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S13	After each seasonal launch, we release additional new collections.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S14	These collections often utilize or are inspired by that season s patterns (e.g., the paper and gift collection in a new pattern), but a few of our releases are separate from the Signature Collection (e.g., the Vera Vera collection in solid colors).
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S15	We have increased the number of patterns per Signature release as well as the frequency of subsequent releases over time and believe that the assortment, breadth, and cadence allow us to reach a broader range of consumer demographics and needs.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S16	We believe this approach keeps consumers continually engaged with our brand and repeatedly shopping at our points of distribution.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S17	In addition, we believe this approach allows us to minimize the risk associated with a single pattern not performing to our expectations.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S18	To keep our assortment current and fresh and to focus our inventory investments on our best performers, we discontinue patterns from time to time.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S19	We sell our remaining inventory of discontinued products at our annual outlet sale and through our website and outlet stores.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P27_S20	The following chart presents net revenues generated by each of our three product categories and other revenues as a percentage of our total net revenues for fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010:
1495320_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	(1) Includes primarily merchandising, freight, promotional products, and licensing revenues.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	(2) Excludes net revenues generated by our annual outlet sale.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	Handbags are a core part of our product offerings and are the primary component of every Signature Collection.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	The category consists of classic and new styles developed by our product development team to meet consumer demand and drive repeat purchases.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	Our handbag product category extends beyond handbags to include totes and specialty bags such as baby bags, backpacks, and laptop portfolios.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P31_S2	Handbags play a prominent role in our visual merchandising, and we focus on showcasing the different patterns, colors, and features of each bag.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	Accessories, our second largest revenue category, include fashion accessories such as wallets, ID cases, eyeglass cases, cosmetics, paper and gift products, and eyewear.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	Accessories are attractively priced and allow the consumer to include some color in her wardrobe, even if tucked into another bag.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P32_S2	Our product development team consistently updates the accessories assortment based on consumer demand and fashion trends.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P32_S3	Our travel and leisure product category includes duffel bags, garment bags, rolling luggage, and travel accessories, such as travel cosmetic cases.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	The first Vera Bradley product offering included duffel bags, which consistently have been a strong performer.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	We believe their popularity, as well as the appeal of our other travel and leisure items, results from our vibrant designs, functional styles, and lightweight fabrications.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	We have implemented a fully integrated and cross-functional product development process that aligns design, market research, merchandise management, sales, marketing, and sourcing.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P33_S3	Product development is a core capability that makes our products unique and provides us with a competitive advantage.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P33_S4	Our designs and aesthetics set our products apart and drive customer loyalty.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P33_S5	Our product development team mixes an understanding of the needs of our target customers with knowledge of upcoming color and fashion trends to design new collections as well as new product categories that will resonate in the market.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P33_S6	We begin the development stage of our products in the Vera Bradley portfolio 12 18 months in advance of their release.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P33_S7	The development of each new pattern includes the design of an overall print, a complementary fabric backing, and three sizes of coordinating trim materials.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P33_S8	To seek fresh perspectives, we collaborate with independent designers to create unique patterns for each season.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P33_S9	We oversee the development and exercise the final approval of all patterns and designs.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P33_S10	Once developed, we generally copyright each pattern, including the print, fabric backing and coordinating trim.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P33_S11	We believe that great design is not only central to our product development efforts, but also is a fundamental part of our brand development and growth strategies.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P33_S12	In the past several years, we have made investments to evolve and integrate our product development expertise, including opening a design office in New York City, as well as opening a design center in Roanoke, Indiana that puts all individuals involved in the product design process in the same location.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P33_S13	Our product development team works to ensure that new collections contain an assortment of products and styles that are in line with both fashion trends and customer needs and regularly updates classic styles to enhance functionality.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P33_S14	In addition, we actively pursue opportunities to expand our product offerings through new line and brand extensions.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P33_S15	Our product development team monitors fashion trends and customer needs by attending major trend shows in Europe and the United States, subscribing to trend monitoring services, and engaging in comparison shopping.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P33_S16	Our product development team is also responsible for assortment planning, pricing, forecasting, promotional development, and product lifecycle management.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	Forecasting is based on seasonal market research and in-store testing.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	We gather seasonal market research through a variety of methodologies, including scheduled interviews and online and in-person surveys.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P34_S2	We conduct seasonal in-store testing by releasing test products in our full-price stores and evaluating their success in the marketplace prior to product introduction on a larger scale.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	We believe that with our cross-functional, collaborative approach, we are able to introduce and sell our merchandise in a way that clearly communicates the Vera Bradley brand and the Vera Bradley lifestyle.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	Marketing We believe that the growth of our brand and our business is influenced by our ability to introduce and sell our merchandise in a way that clearly conveys the Vera Bradley lifestyle.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P35_S2	We use marketing and advertising as critical tools in our efforts to promote our brand.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P35_S3	The seasonal Vera Bradley catalog is a key vehicle for the brand and our product portfolio.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P35_S4	Each season s catalog is sent to a targeted customer mailing list.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P35_S5	In addition to distributing the catalog, we produce and distribute a number of other marketing pieces, or collateral, including postcards, gift guides, in-store signage, and release-focused mailers.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P35_S6	Catalogs and collateral provide consumers with a powerful visual representation of both the products and lifestyle images embodied by the Vera Bradley brand.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P35_S7	We believe that Vera Bradley s catalogs and other mailed collateral generate excitement and awareness about the brand and seasonal introductions and allow us to reach both new and loyal customers in their homes.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P35_S8	We employ print and outdoor advertising to increase overall brand awareness.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P35_S9	Our advertisements are placed primarily in national magazines that have a readership similar to our target demographics.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P35_S10	These publications have recently included Seventeen , InStyle, O the Oprah Magazine, and Real Simple .
1495320_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	We continually assess our advertising strategies and tactics.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	Vera Bradley has received considerable exposure in the press, including in publications such as InStyle, O the Oprah Magazine, Good Housekeeping, Coastal Living, and The New York Times .
1495320_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	In addition, we have expanded our marketing efforts to promote product placement in feature-length films and on prime-time television shows such as Desperate Housewives, Brothers and Sisters, Entourage, Modern Family, and New Girl .
1495320_12_ITEM1_P37_S2	In recent years, we have greatly increased traffic to verabradley.com and have increased awareness of our brand through online marketing and social networking sites.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P37_S3	We have captured more than 1.2 million customer e-mail addresses in our online customer file, with many of these customers providing age, occupation, and location data.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P37_S4	This captured information provides us with deeper insight into the products and categories that are in the highest demand, and allows us to better target our customers with appropriate messages.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P37_S5	As of January 28, 2012, we had over 700,000 Facebook fans and a growing number of Twitter followers.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P37_S6	We believe these media not only connect us with our fans, but also allow us to target them through cross-channel marketing.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	Channels of Distribution We distribute our products through our Direct and Indirect segments.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	This multi-channel distribution model not only enables us to have operational flexibility, but also maximizes the methods by which we can access potential customers.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P38_S2	We have developed a retail presence through our full-price stores, all located in the United States, which provides us with a format to showcase the image and products of Vera Bradley.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P38_S3	As of January 28, 2012, we operated 48 full-price stores.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P38_S4	Our full-price stores average approximately 1,800 square feet per store.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P38_S5	Our stores are designed to create a feeling of home with a high standard of visual merchandising.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P38_S6	The welcoming nature of our full-price stores provides our customers with a comfortable shopping experience in a setting that showcases our merchandise and conveys the Vera Bradley lifestyle.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P38_S7	Our sales associates are passionate about our products and customer service, which, we believe, translates into a superior shopping experience.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	In 2006, we began selling our products through the verabradley.com website.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	The objective of verabradley.com is to provide both a mechanism for marketing directly to consumers and a storefront where consumers can find the entire Vera Bradley collection.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P39_S2	In fiscal 2010, we invested in upgrades to our website that enable us to provide customized shopping experiences tailored to each online shopper and allow better integration with third-party sites such as Facebook.com.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P39_S3	We believe the enhanced functionality allows us to provide a superior experience to our e-commerce customers.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P39_S4	In fiscal 2012, we had over 43 million visits to verabradley.com.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our outlet stores are a vehicle for selling discontinued merchandise at discounted prices, while maintaining brand identity.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	We believe our outlet stores are an integral part of our distribution strategy, as this format provides an additional channel of distribution for our products and enables us to better target value-oriented customers.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	We launched a marketing campaign to connect with the Japanese consumer on April 18, 2011.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P41_S1	This campaign included seven temporary pop-up stores in several department stores including Isetan Shinjuku and Marui Yurakucho located across Tokyo and Kyoto.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P41_S2	The international channel includes the Japanese website verabradley.co.jp launched in fiscal 2012.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	For the last ten years, our annual outlet sale has been held in the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum Exposition Center in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P42_S1	The annual outlet sale is an important tradition for Vera Bradley, has many loyal followers, and is an opportunity for us to sell our discontinued merchandise at discounted prices in a brand-right fashion.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P42_S2	We attracted more than 60,000 attendees to our 2011 annual outlet sale.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P42_S3	As of January 28, 2012, we had approximately 3,300 Indirect retailers, the majority of which were specialty retailers with whom we have had long-standing relationships.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P42_S4	In fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, our Indirect channel generated net revenues of $235.6 million, $214.9 million, and $192.8 million, respectively, or, as a percentage of our total net revenues, 51.1%, 58.7%, and 66.7%, respectively.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	Indirect retailers are primarily gift, apparel and accessories, travel, or other specialty retailers.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	No single account represented more than 3.0% of total Indirect net revenues in fiscal 2012, with the top ten accounts representing in the aggregate less than 13.0% of total Indirect net revenues.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	The majority of our Indirect retailers have been customers for over five years.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P44_S1	In fiscal 2012, we launched our products in the department store channel.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P44_S2	We believe that having an in-house sales force results in more consistent brand presentation and messaging, enhanced support for our Indirect retailers, and a more predictable, scalable, and cost-efficient business model.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P44_S3	As of January 28, 2012, our sales team consisted of 87 in-house, full-time sales consultants.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P44_S4	The compensation structure for our sales consultants consists of a combination of fixed pay and sales-based incentives.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P44_S5	In addition to acquiring new and growing existing accounts, our sales consultants serve as a support center for our Indirect retailers by assisting and educating them in areas such as merchandising and visual presentation, marketing of the brand, product selection, and inventory management.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P44_S6	Our sales consultants also participate in our semi-annual product introduction and education event for our Indirect retailers.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P44_S7	Our visual merchandising program provides our sales consultants with a framework to guide our Indirect retailers regarding optimal product placement and display that is intended to reinforce the message that our brand is distinct from those of our competitors.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	Our Stores As of January 28, 2012, we operated 56 stores in 27 states throughout the United States, which includes 48 full-price stores.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	United States can support at least 300 Vera Bradley full-price stores.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	Based on the success of our existing outlet stores, the number of attractive outlet centers in the United States, and the growing popularity of outlet shopping, we believe the United States has capacity to support additional Vera Bradley outlet stores.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P46_S2	We opened thirteen full-price stores and four outlet stores in fiscal 2012.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P46_S3	We plan to open 14 to 20 new stores annually during each of the next five fiscal years.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P46_S4	Our store location decisions are made case by case, depending on the combined retail strategy we have developed for the particular market.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P46_S5	This includes actual and planned penetration in both Indirect and Direct segments, as well as existing e-commerce demand.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P46_S6	At this time, we do not believe any market has been fully penetrated.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P46_S7	We believe that expansion of our store base complements our Indirect segment by increasing brand awareness and reinforcing our brand image.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	In addition to analyzing store economics, we pay particular attention to the location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P47_S1	Along with seeking co-tenants that we believe share our target customer, we seek a balanced mix of moderate and high-end retailers to encourage high levels of traffic.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P47_S2	Our target full-price store size is approximately 1,800 square feet, but we are comfortable with spaces as small as 1,000 square feet or, depending on our market strategy and relevant economic factors, spaces as large as 2,800 square feet.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P47_S3	Our full-price stores are located primarily in high-traffic regional malls, lifestyle centers, and mixed-use shopping centers across the United States.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P47_S4	The following table shows the number of full-price and outlet stores we operated in each state as of January 28, 2012:
1495320_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	The focus of our store operations is providing consumers with a comfortable shopping experience.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P48_S1	We strive to make the experience interactive through special store events, such as showcasing newly launched products or celebrating our namesake s birthday.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P48_S2	Our customer service philosophy emphasizes friendly service, merchandise knowledge, and passion for the brand.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P48_S3	Consequently, an essential requirement for the success of our stores is our ability to attract, train, and retain talented, highly motivated district managers, store managers, and sales associates.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P48_S4	Our district and store managers are our primary link to the consumer, and we continually invest in their development.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	Store Economics We believe that our innovative retail concept and distinctive retail experience contribute to the success of our stores, most of which generate strong productivity and returns.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	We expect our full-price stores to average approximately 1,800 square feet per store, and we expect to invest approximately $0.4 million per new store, consisting of inventory costs, pre-opening costs, and build-out costs less tenant-improvement allowances.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P49_S2	New full-price stores generate on average between $1.1 million and $1.3 million in net revenues during the first twelve months, and the payback on our investment is expected to occur in less than 18 months.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	Manufacturing and Supply Chain Model Our manufacturing and supply chain model is designed to maximize flexibility in order to meet shifting demands in the market.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our model utilizes offshore raw material suppliers and a blend of offshore and domestic manufacturing.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P50_S2	We place a strong emphasis on continuous improvement and have employed lean manufacturing concepts.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P50_S3	Our broad-based, multi-country manufacturing and supply chain model is designed to achieve efficient, timely, and accurate order fulfillment while maintaining appropriate levels of inventory.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P50_S4	Our sourcing strategy is part of the larger cross-functional product development process.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P50_S5	The overall objective for our sourcing team is to build and sustain collaborative partnerships throughout our supply chain, with a focus on identifying appropriate countries and partners to manufacture our products.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P50_S6	The sourcing team leverages its expertise in negotiation, relationship management, and change management to maintain a strong global supply chain.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P50_S7	We strive to maintain the appropriate balance of inventory to enable us to provide a high level of service to our customers, including prompt and accurate delivery of our products.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P50_S8	We have an active sales and operations planning process that helps us balance the supply and demand issues that we encounter in our business, optimize our inventory levels, and anticipate inventory needs.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P50_S9	We have also integrated our planning, forecasting, and segmentation processes under one function called Inventory Planning and Deployment.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P50_S10	This integrated function along with the creation of a Merchant function, has allowed for further improvements to our inventory management processes.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	The majority of our products are cotton-based.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P51_S1	Our other products are made from specialty fabrics (including nylon and microfiber) and paper.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P51_S2	We source our materials from various suppliers in Asia, with the majority coming from China and South Korea.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P51_S3	Our global supply chain and purchasing teams work together with select suppliers enabling us to optimize the mix of cost, lead time, quality, and reliability within our global supply network.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P51_S4	All of our suppliers must comply with our quality standards, and we use only a limited number of pre-approved suppliers who have demonstrated a commitment to delivering the highest quality products.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P51_S5	In December 2008, we opened an office in Dongguan, China, which enables us to increase our control over the manufacturing and supply chain process and monitor compliance with our quality standards.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	A significant majority of our finished goods products are manufactured externally overseas.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	These products are made by a variety of global manufacturers located primarily in China.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P52_S2	We are not dependent upon any single manufacturer for our products.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P52_S3	When determining the size of orders placed with our manufacturers, we take into account forward-looking demand, lead times for specific products, current inventory levels, and minimum order quantity requirements.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	Overseas production has resulted in substantial cost savings and a reduction of capital investment.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P53_S1	With the oversight of our office in China and our independent contractors, we believe these financial benefits have been realized without sacrificing the level of quality inherent in our products or service to our customers.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P53_S2	The remainder of our products are manufactured in the United States to provide flexibility in our supply chain.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	This capability allows us to manufacture finished product to respond quickly to shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P54_S1	In fiscal 2012, approximately 10% of our units were produced in our domestic manufacturing facility.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P54_S2	In 2007, we consolidated our warehousing and shipping functions into one, 217,320 square-foot distribution center, located in Roanoke, Indiana.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P54_S3	This highly automated, computerized facility allows Vera Bradley employees to receive information directly from the order-collection center and quickly identify the products and quantity necessary for a particular order.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P54_S4	In addition, we employ a warehouse-control system that controls the flow of our products through 5,000 feet of automated conveyer.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P54_S5	The facility s advanced technology enables us to more accurately process and pack orders, as well as track shipments and inventory.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P54_S6	We believe that our systems for the processing and shipment of orders from our distribution center have enabled us to improve our overall customer service through enhanced order accuracy and reduced turnaround time.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P54_S7	During fiscal 2012, we began a 200,000 square-foot expansion of the distribution facility, which we expect to complete in fiscal 2013.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P54_S8	We strive to maintain the appropriate balance of inventory to enable us to provide a high level of service to our customers, including prompt and accurate delivery of our products.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P54_S9	We have an active Inventory Planning and Deployment function that helps us balance the supply and demand issues that we encounter in our business, optimize our inventory levels, and anticipate inventory needs.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P54_S10	Our products are shipped primarily via FedEx and common carriers to our stores, our Indirect retailers, and directly to our customers who purchase through our website.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P54_S11	We believe we are positioned well to support the order fulfillment requirements of our growing business, including business generated through our website.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P54_S12	We believe that high levels of automation and technology are essential to maintain our competitive position.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P54_S13	We maintain computer hardware, systems applications, and networks to enhance and accelerate the design process, to support the sale and distribution of our products to our customers, and to improve the integration and efficiency of our operations.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P54_S14	Our management information systems are designed to provide, among other things, comprehensive order processing, production, accounting, and management information for the product development, retail, sales, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, finance, and human resources functions of our business.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P54_S15	We use several specialized systems, including MICROS-Retail, SAP, and SCALE, for our information technology requirements.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	Competition We face strong competition in each of the product lines and markets in which we compete.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	We believe that all of our products are in similar competitive positions with respect to the number of competitors they face and the level of competition within each product line.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P55_S2	Due to the number of different products we offer, it is not practicable for us to quantify the number of competitors we face.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P55_S3	Our products compete with other branded products within their product categories and with private label products sold by retailers.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P55_S4	In our Indirect business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers, and distributors of handbags, accessories, and other products for the limited space available for the display of such products to the consumer.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P55_S5	Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	In our Direct business, we compete against other specialty retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, gift retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P56_S1	The market for handbags, in particular, is highly competitive.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P56_S2	Our competitors include not only established companies that are expanding their production and marketing of handbags, but also frequent new entrants to the market.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P56_S3	We directly compete with wholesalers and direct sellers of branded handbags and accessories, such as Coach, Nine West, Liz Claiborne, Dooney Bourke, and Michael Kors.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	In varying degrees, depending on the product category involved, we compete on the basis of design (aesthetic appeal), quality (construction), function, price point, distribution, and brand positioning.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P57_S1	We believe that our primary competitive advantages are consumer recognition of our brand, customer loyalty, product development expertise, and our widespread presence through our multi-channel distribution model.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P57_S2	Some of our competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources than we do.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P57_S3	Further, we may face new competitors and increased competition from existing competitors as we expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	Copyrights and Trademarks The development of each new pattern includes the design of an overall print, a complementary fabric backing, and coordinating trim materials.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P58_S1	Once developed, we generally copyright each pattern, including the print, fabric backing, and coordinating trim.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P58_S2	We currently have in excess of 400 copyrights.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P58_S3	We also own all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing, and distribution of all of our products, both in the United States and in the other countries in which our products are principally sold.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P58_S4	We aggressively police our trademarks and copyrights and pursue infringers both domestically and internationally.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P58_S5	We also pursue counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally, as well as through external sources monitoring use in the market.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P58_S6	Our trademarks will remain in existence for as long as we continue to use and renew them on their expiration dates.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	Employees As of January 28, 2012, we had 2,078 employees.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P59_S1	Of the total, 1,046 were engaged in retail selling positions, 327 were engaged in manufacturing functions, 32 were engaged in product design, and 460 were engaged in corporate support and administrative functions.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P59_S2	The remaining employees were engaged in other aspects of our business.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P59_S3	None of our employees is represented by a union.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P59_S4	We believe that our relations with our employees are good, and we have never encountered a significant work stoppage.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P59_S5	Many of our imported products are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs, or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the United States and other countries or impact the cost of such products.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P59_S6	To date, we have not been restricted by quotas in the operation of our business, and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of a majority of our products.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P59_S7	In addition, we are subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions, including U.S. retaliation against prohibited foreign practices, with respect to our product sourcing and international sales operations.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P59_S8	We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental matters, including the handling, transportation, and disposal of our products and our non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, and groundwater.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P59_S9	Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties, or the imposition of other liabilities.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect upon our earnings or financial position.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P60_S1	If we violate any laws or regulations, however, it could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance.
1495320_12_ITEM1_P60_S2	Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on our website, www.verabradley.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
1495320_12_ITEM1_P60_S3	No information contained on our website is intended to be included as part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	consider all of the information in this report, particularly the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in future periods.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The risks described below are not the only risks that we face.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in future periods.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Risks Related to Our Business Changes in general economic conditions, and their impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In recent years, consumer confidence and consumer spending deteriorated significantly, influenced by fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, changing fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, higher levels of unemployment and consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty, and this could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S3	In the event of another significant economic downturn, we could experience lower than expected net revenues, which could force us to delay or slow the implementation of our growth strategies and adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our inability to predict and respond in a timely manner to changes in consumer demand could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Our success depends on our ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies consumer demand in a timely manner.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S7	We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to develop appealing patterns and styles or meet changing consumer demands in the future.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S8	If we misjudge the market for our products, we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Merchandise misjudgments could adversely impact our net revenues and results of operations.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S10	Our results of operations could suffer if we lose key management or design associates or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S11	Our performance depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and product development teams.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S12	These executives and design associates have substantial experience in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S13	We do not have employment agreements with any of our key executives or design associates.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S14	The unexpected loss of services of certain of these individuals could have adverse impacts on our business and results of operations.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S15	As our business grows and we open new stores, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees and develop, train, and manage an increasing number of management-level, sales, and other employees.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S16	Competition for qualified employees is intense.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S17	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain employees as needed in the future.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S18	Our business depends on a strong brand.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S19	If we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand, then we may be unable to sell our products, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P1_S20	We believe that the brand image that we have developed has contributed significantly to the success of our business.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as product design, store operations, and community relations.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brand image, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	If we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategies or manage our growing business, our future operating results could suffer.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	The success of our growth strategies, alone or collectively, will depend on various factors, including the appeal of our product designs, retail presentation to consumers, competitive conditions, and economic conditions.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	If we are unsuccessful in implementing some or all of our strategies or initiatives, our future operating results could be adversely impacted.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Successful implementation of our strategies will require us to manage our growth.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S6	To manage our growth effectively, we will need to continue to increase production while maintaining strict quality control.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S7	We also will need to continue to improve and invest in our systems and processes to keep pace with planned increases in demand.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S8	We could suffer a decline in sales if our products do not continue to meet our quality control standards or if we are unable to respond adequately to increases in customer demand for our products.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S9	We are continuing to invest in our specialty retailers to support them in growing along with Vera Bradley.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S10	This channel will continue to evolve over time as we balance the channel dynamics between the specialty retailer, our Direct stores, and e-commerce.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S11	Additionally, our current growth strategy includes plans to expand internationally.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S12	We currently plan to open additional shop-in-shop stores within Japanese department stores.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S13	We do not yet have significant experience operating in Japan, and we face established competitors.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S14	Furthermore, Japan has different operational characteristics, including but not limited to employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, and local reporting or legal requirements.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S15	In addition, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in Japan, and as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S16	If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, our financial results could be adversely affected.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S17	We may not be able to successfully open and operate new stores as planned, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S18	Our continued growth will depend on our ability to successfully open and operate new stores.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S19	We plan to open 14 to 20 new stores during each of the next five fiscal years.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P2_S20	Our ability to successfully open and operate new stores depends on many factors, including our ability to:
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	successfully integrate new stores into our existing operations and information technology systems.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The success of new store openings may also be affected by our ability to initiate marketing efforts in advance of opening our first store in a particular region.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Additionally, we will encounter pre-operating costs and we may encounter initial losses while new stores commence operations, which could strain our resources and adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our inability to sustain levels of comparable-store sales could cause our stock price to decline.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We may not be able to sustain the levels of comparable-store sales that we have experienced in the recent past.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If our future comparable-store sales decline or fail to meet market expectations, then the price of our common stock could decline.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Also, the aggregate results of operations of our stores have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Numerous factors influence comparable-store sales, including fashion trends, competition, national and regional economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, inventory shrinkage, marketing programs, and weather conditions.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In addition, many companies with retail operations have been unable to sustain high levels of comparable-store sales during and after periods of substantial expansion.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	These factors may cause our comparable-store sales results to be lower in the future than in recent periods or lower than expectations, either of which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We do not own any real estate other than our warehouse and distribution facility.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We lease our corporate headquarters, our other offices, and all of our store locations.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We typically occupy our stores under operating leases with terms of ten years.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We have been able to negotiate favorable rental rates in recent years due in part to the state of the economy and high vacancy rates within some shopping centers, but there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to negotiate such favorable terms.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Some of our leases have early cancellation clauses, which permit the lease to be terminated by us or the landlord if certain sales levels are not met in specific periods or if the shopping center does not meet specified occupancy standards.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P6_S6	In addition to requiring future minimum lease payments, some of our store leases provide for the payment of common area maintenance charges, real property insurance, and real estate taxes.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Many of our lease agreements have escalating rent provisions over the initial term and any extensions.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P6_S8	As we expand our store base, our lease expense and our cash outlays for rent under lease agreements will increase.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P6_S9	Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including:
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	limiting our ability to obtain additional financing.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Any of these consequences could place us at a disadvantage with respect to our competitors.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We depend on cash flow from operating activities to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses and needs, we may not be able to service our lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would harm our business.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Additional sites that we lease may be subject to long-term non-cancelable leases if we are unable to negotiate our current standard lease terms.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, including paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Moreover, even if a lease has an early cancellation clause, we may not satisfy the contractual requirements for early cancellation under the lease.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Our inability to enter new leases or renew existing leases on acceptable terms or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that we close would, in any such case, affect us adversely.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We operate in a competitive market.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our competitors might develop products more popular with consumers than our products.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The market for handbags, accessories, and travel and leisure items is competitive.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	establishing and maintaining good working relationships with our Indirect retailers.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In our Indirect business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers, and distributors of handbags, accessories, and other products for the limited space available for the display of such products to the consumer.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	In our Direct business, we compete against other gift and specialty retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P11_S4	We rely on various contract manufacturers to produce a significant majority of our products and generally do not have long-term contracts with our manufacturers.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Disruptions in our contract manufacturers systems, losses of manufacturing certifications, or other actions by these manufacturers could increase our cost of sales, adversely affect our net revenues, and injure our reputation and customer relationships, thereby harming our business.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Our various contract manufacturers produce a significant majority of our products.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P11_S7	We generally do not enter into long-term formal written agreements with our manufacturers and instead transact business with each of them on an order-by-order basis.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P11_S8	In the event of a disruption in our contract manufacturers systems, we may be unable to locate alternative manufacturers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P11_S9	Identifying a suitable manufacturer is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with the prospective manufacturer s quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability, and labor practices.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P11_S10	Any delay, interruption, or increased cost in the manufactured products that might occur for any reason, such as the lack of long-term contracts or regulatory requirements and the loss of certifications, power interruptions, fires, hurricanes, war, or threats of terrorism, could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products, adversely affect our net revenues, increase our cost of sales, and hurt our results of operations.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P11_S11	In addition, manufacturing disruption could injure our reputation and customer relationships, thereby harming our business.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We rely on various suppliers to supply a significant majority of our raw materials.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Disruption in the supply of raw materials could increase our cost of goods sold and adversely affect our net revenues.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We generally do not enter into long-term formal written agreements with our suppliers and typically transact business with each of them on an order-by-order basis.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P12_S3	As a result, we cannot assure that there will be no significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from our current sources or, in the event of a disruption, that we would be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We rely on a single warehouse and distribution facility for all of the products we sell.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Disruption to that facility could adversely impact our results of operations, and expansion of that facility could have unpredictable adverse effects.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our warehouse and distribution operations are currently concentrated in a single, company-owned distribution center in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Any significant disruption in the operation of the facility due to natural disaster or severe weather, or events such as fire, accidents, power outages, system failures, or other unforeseen causes, could devalue or damage a significant portion of our inventory and could adversely affect our product distribution and sales until such time as we could secure an alternative facility.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P13_S4	If we encounter difficulties with our distribution facility or other problems or disasters arise, we cannot ensure that critical systems and operations will be restored in a timely manner or at all, and this would have a material adverse effect on our business.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P13_S5	In addition, our growth could require us to further expand our current facility, which could affect us adversely in ways that we cannot predict.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P13_S6	The cost of raw materials could increase our cost of sales and cause our results of operations to suffer.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P13_S7	Fluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of fabrics or other raw materials used to manufacture our products, as well as the price for labor, marketing, and transportation, could have adverse impacts on our cost of sales and our ability to meet our customers demands.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P13_S8	In particular, fluctuations in the price of cotton, our primary raw material, could have an adverse impact on our cost of sales.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P13_S9	In addition, because a key component of our products is petroleum-based, the cost of oil affects the cost of our products.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P13_S10	Upward movement in the price of oil in the global oil markets would also likely result in rising fuel and freight prices, which could increase our shipping costs.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P13_S11	In the future, we may not be able to pass all or a portion of higher costs on to our customers.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P13_S12	Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing and manufacturing activities.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P13_S13	We source our fabrics primarily from manufacturers in China and South Korea and outsource the production of a significant majority of our products to companies in Asia.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P13_S14	We are subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing and manufacturing, including, but not limited to:
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	natural disasters, acts of war and terrorism, changing macroeconomic trends, and other external factors over which we have no control.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Additionally, we do not have complete oversight over our contract manufacturers.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Violation of labor or other laws by those manufacturers, or the divergence of a contract manufacturer s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States or in other markets in which we may in the future do business, could also draw negative publicity for us and our brand, diminishing the value of our brand and reducing demand for our products.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our ability to source our products at favorable prices, or at all, could be harmed, with adverse effects on our results of operations, if new trade restrictions are imposed or if existing trade restrictions become more burdensome.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	A significant majority of our products are currently manufactured for us in Asia.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The United States and the countries in which our products are produced have imposed and may impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or regulations or may adversely adjust prevailing quotas, duties, or tariffs.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Countries impose, modify, and remove tariffs and other trade restrictions in response to a diverse array of factors, including global and national economic and political conditions, which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other trade restrictions.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Trade restrictions, which include embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us or could require us to modify supply chain organization or other current business practices, any of which could harm our results of operations.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs, especially if the Employee Free Choice Act is adopted.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Currently, none of our employees is represented by a union.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Nevertheless, our employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to organize or affiliate with a union.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P17_S6	If some or all of our workforce were to become unionized, our business would be exposed to work stoppages and slowdowns as a unionized business.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P17_S7	If, in addition, the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly more favorable to union workers than our current pay-and-benefits arrangements, our costs would increase and our results of operations would suffer.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Our results of operations are subject to quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P17_S9	Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including, among other things:
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	the timing of new pattern releases and new product introductions.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	As a result of these quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our sales and operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Any quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	This could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P18_S4	We rely on independent transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We currently rely on independent transportation service providers for substantially all of our product shipments.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our utilization of these delivery services, or those of any other shipping companies that we may elect to use, is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, and employee strikes and inclement weather, which may impact the shipping company s ability to provide delivery services sufficient to meet our shipping needs.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	If for any reason we were to change shipping companies, we could face logistical difficulties that might adversely affect deliveries, and we would incur costs and expend resources in the course of making the change.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Moreover, we might not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from the service providers that we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We also would face shipping and distribution risks and uncertainties associated with any expansion of our warehouse and distribution facility and related systems.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We plan to use cash provided by operating activities to fund our expanding business and execute our growth strategies and may require additional capital, which may not be available to us.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Our business relies on cash provided by operating activities as our primary source of liquidity.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P20_S5	To support our growing business and execute our growth strategies, we will need significant amounts of cash from that source, including funds to pay our lease obligations, build out new store space, purchase inventory, pay personnel, invest further in our infrastructure and facilities, and pay for the costs associated with operating as a public company.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P20_S6	If our business does not generate cash flow from operating activities sufficient to fund these activities, and if sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from our existing revolving credit facility, we will need to seek additional capital, through debt or equity financings, to fund our growth.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P20_S7	If new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, then we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would inhibit our growth and could harm our business.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We face various risks as an e-commerce retailer.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Business risks relating to e-commerce sales include the need to keep pace with rapid technological change, internet security risks, risks of system failure or inadequacy, governmental regulation, and taxation.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We have contracted with several different companies to maintain and operate various aspects of our e-commerce business and are reliant on them and their ability to perform their tasks, as well as their operational, privacy, and security procedures and controls as they affect our business.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	If the independent contractors on which we rely fail to perform their tasks, we could incur liability or suffer damages to our reputation, or both.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Our copyrights, trademarks and other proprietary rights could conflict with the rights of others, and we may be inhibited from selling some of our products.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P21_S5	If we are unable to protect our copyrights and other proprietary rights, others may sell imitation brand products.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P21_S6	We believe that our registered copyrights, registered and common law trademarks, and other proprietary rights have significant value and are critical to our ability to create and sustain demand for our products.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Although we have not been inhibited from selling our products in connection with intellectual property disputes, we cannot assure you that obstacles will not arise as we expand our product line and extend our brand as well as the geographic scope of our sales and marketing.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P21_S8	We also cannot assure you that the actions taken by us to establish and protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products or infringement of our rights by others.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P21_S9	The legal regimes of some foreign countries, particularly China, may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by others in these countries.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P21_S10	The loss of copyrights, trademarks, and other proprietary rights could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P21_S11	Any litigation regarding our proprietary rights could be time consuming and costly.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P21_S12	Prior to the completion of the Reorganization, we were treated as an S Corporation under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code, and claims of taxing authorities related to our prior status as an S Corporation could harm us.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P21_S13	Upon the completion of the Reorganization in fiscal 2011, our S Corporation status terminated automatically and we became subject to increased federal and state income taxes.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	penalties, and we do not have the right to reclaim tax distributions we have made to our shareholders during those periods.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	These amounts could include taxes on all of our taxable income while we were an S Corporation.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Any such claims could result in additional costs to us and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results and stock price.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We are subject to income taxes in many U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which includes reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Further, possible changes in federal, state, local, and non-U.S. tax laws bearing upon our revenues, income, property, or other aspects of our operations or business would, if enacted, affect our results of operations in ways and to a degree that we cannot currently predict.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Additional indebtedness incurred in connection with the Reorganization may decrease business flexibility and increase borrowing costs.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	On October 4, 2010, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that increased our available credit from $75 million to $125 million.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Also in October 2010, in connection with the Reorganization, we increased the outstanding borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement to fund a final S Corporation distribution to our then-shareholders.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	As of January 28, 2012, we had outstanding borrowings of $25.0 million under our amended and restated credit agreement, compared to $66.8 million outstanding under our former credit facility as of January 29, 2011.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Our indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of:
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to companies that have less debt.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our Indirect business could suffer as a result of bankruptcies or operational or financial difficulties of our Indirect retailers.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We do not enter into long-term agreements with any of our Indirect retailers.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers for each of our lines every season.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P27_S4	A decision by a significant number of Indirect retailers, whether motivated by competitive conditions, operational or financial difficulties, reduced access to capital, or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or to change their manner of doing business with us could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Although we recommend retail sale prices for our products to our Indirect retailers, we do not provide dealer allowances or other economic incentives to support those prices.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P27_S6	Possible promotional pricing or discounting by Indirect retailers in response to softening retail demand could have a negative effect on our brand image and prestige, which might be difficult to counteract as the economy improves.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We sell our Indirect merchandise primarily to specialty retail stores across the United States and extend trade credit based on an evaluation of each Indirect retailer s financial condition, usually without requiring collateral.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Perceived financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Pending the resolution of a relationship with a financially troubled Indirect retailer, we might assume credit risk that we would otherwise avoid relating to our receivables from that customer.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Inability to collect on accounts receivable from our Indirect retailers would adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	There are claims made against us from time to time that can result in litigation or regulatory proceedings, which could distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability or damage to our brand image.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	As a growing company with expanding operations, we increasingly face the risk of litigation and other claims against us.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Litigation and other claims may arise in the ordinary course of our business and include employee claims, custom and duty claims, commercial disputes, intellectual property issues, product-oriented allegations, and slip and fall claims.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Often these cases raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Litigation and other claims against us could result in unexpected expenses and liability, as well as materially adversely affect our operations and our reputation.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Risks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock Our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell shares at or above the price at which you purchase them.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P30_S6	The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	These and other factors may result in a lower market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	As a result, our common stock may trade at prices significantly below the offering price.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	In addition, the stock markets, including The Nasdaq Global Select Market, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many retail companies.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P31_S3	In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P31_S4	If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Because a limited number of shareholders control a large percentage of the voting power of our common stock, investors may have limited ability to determine the outcome of shareholder votes.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Barbara Bradley Baekgaard, Patricia R. Miller and P. Michael Miller, directly or indirectly, beneficially own and have the ability to exercise voting control over, in the aggregate, 39.7% of our outstanding shares of common stock.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P32_S2	As a result, these shareholders are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, any amendments to our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and significant corporate transactions.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	common stock may limit your ability to influence corporate matters, and the interests of these shareholders may not coincide with our interests or your interests.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	As a result, we may take actions that you do not believe to be in our interests or your interests and that could depress our stock price.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	In addition, this significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock should investors perceive disadvantages in owning shares of common stock in a company that has such concentrated ownership.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	From time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management s estimates as of the date of release.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P34_S2	This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in the release.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed, but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P35_S2	The principal reason that we release these data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P35_S3	We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data are forecast.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P36_S4	In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Indiana law may discourage or prevent a change in control, even if a sale of the company would be beneficial to our shareholders, which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by shareholders to replace or remove our current management.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control, discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock, harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	requiring advance notice for raising business matters or nominating directors at shareholders meetings.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	As permitted by our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, our board of directors also has the ability, should they so determine, to adopt a shareholder rights agreement, sometimes called a poison pill, providing for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common stock.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	In the event of a takeover attempt, this preferred stock would give rights to holders of common stock (other than the potential acquirer) to buy additional shares of common stock at a discount, leading to the dilution of the potential acquirer s stake.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The adoption of a poison pill, or the board s ability to do so, can have negative effects such as those described above.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	As an Indiana corporation, we are governed by the Indiana Business Corporation Law (as amended from time to time, the IBCL ).
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Under specified circumstances, certain provisions of the IBCL related to control share acquisitions, business combinations and constituent interests may delay, prevent or make more difficult unsolicited acquisitions or changes of control of us.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P41_S2	These provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our management.
1495320_12_ITEM1A_P41_S3	It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that shareholders might deem to be in their best interest.
1495320_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	forth the location, use, and size of our manufacturing, distribution, and corporate facilities as of January 28, 2012.
1495320_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	The leases on the leased properties expire at various times through 2015, subject to renewal options.
1495320_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	This property is owned by Milburn, LLC, a leasing company in which Barbara Bradley Baekgaard owns a 50% interest and Patricia R. Miller and P. Michael Miller each own a 25% interest.
1495320_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, of this report for additional information regarding this property.
1495320_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	In March 2011, we entered into a lease with Great Dane Realty, LLC, a company owned by Barbara Bradley Baekgaard.
1495320_12_ITEM2_P2_S1	See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, of this report for additional information regarding this property.
1495320_12_ITEM2_P3_S0	As of January 28, 2012, we also leased 62 store locations in the United States, including six store locations opened or to be opened in fiscal 2013.
1495320_12_ITEM2_P3_S1	See Business Our Stores Store Locations for more information regarding the locations of our open stores as of January 28, 2012.
1495320_12_ITEM2_P4_S0	We consider these properties to be in good condition generally and believe that our facilities, including the above-mentioned property under negotiation, are adequate for our operations and provide sufficient capacity to meet our anticipated requirements.

1495320_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the ordinary course, we are involved in the policing of our intellectual property rights.
1495320_12_ITEM3_P0_S2	As part of our policing program, from time to time we file lawsuits in the United States and abroad, alleging acts of trademark counterfeiting, trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and ancillary and pendent state and foreign law claims.
1495320_12_ITEM3_P0_S3	These actions often result in seizure of counterfeit merchandise and negotiated settlements with defendants.
1495320_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	Defendants sometimes raise as affirmative defenses, or as counterclaims, the purported invalidity or unenforceability of our proprietary rights.
1495320_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	We believe that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

1495320_12_ITEM6_P7_S0	(5) Includes full-price and outlet stores.
1495320_12_ITEM6_P7_S1	Our first full-price store opened in mid-September 2007 and our first outlet store opened in November 2009.
1495320_12_ITEM6_P8_S0	(6) Comparable-store sales are the net revenues of our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the period.

1495320_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	Vera Bradley is a leading designer, producer, marketer, and retailer of stylish and highly functional accessories for women.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our products include a wide offering of handbags, accessories, and travel and leisure items.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	Over our 30-year history, Vera Bradley has become a true lifestyle brand that appeals to a broad range of consumers.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P1_S3	Our brand vision is accessible luxury that inspires a casual, fun, and family-oriented lifestyle.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P1_S4	We have positioned our brand to highlight the high quality, distinctive and vibrant styling, and functional design of our products.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P1_S5	Frequent releases of new designs help keep the brand fresh and our customers continually engaged.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P1_S6	We generate revenues by selling products through two reportable segments: Direct and Indirect.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P1_S7	As of January 28, 2012, our Direct business consisted of sales of Vera Bradley products through our 48 full-price stores and eight outlet stores in the United States, seven temporary, pop-up stores in Japan, our websites, verabradley.com and verabradley.co.jp, and our annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P1_S8	We began selling directly to consumers through verabradley.com in calendar year 2006, opened our first retail stores in calendar year 2007, and entered the Japanese market in calendar year 2011.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P1_S9	As of January 28, 2012, our Indirect business consisted of sales of Vera Bradley products to approximately 3,300 specialty retailers, substantially all of which are located in the United States, as well as to select national retailers and independent e-commerce retailers.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	In recent years, we have grown rapidly as a result of the successful implementation of strategic initiatives.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	These initiatives included enhancing our merchandising strategy, establishing a multi-channel distribution sales model, expanding our supply chain capabilities, product development processes, and information systems to improve operational flexibility and profitability.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	In fiscal 2012, we continued to experience strong demand for our brand across all of our sales channels, as reflected in our net revenue growth of 26.0%.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P2_S3	In our Direct segment, net revenues increased 49.1%, including an increase of $39.4 million in revenues related to the opening of new stores, a $28.6 million, or 35.3%, increase in e-commerce revenues, and a comparable-store sales increase of 10.9%.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P2_S4	In our Indirect segment, net revenues increased 9.6%, driven primarily by the strength of product offerings, improved productivity through our retail partners, and the sale of certain retired inventory.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P2_S5	Additionally, we achieved operating income of $96.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2012, compared to an operating income of $53.3 million in the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P2_S6	Operating income for fiscal 2011, included $21.9 million of compensation expense related to restricted-stock awards.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P2_S7	We remain focused on executing our growth strategies, which includes growing in underpenetrated markets and expanding our store base and product offering.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P2_S8	We believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our store base, as we believe the market in the United States can support at least 300 Vera Bradley full-price stores.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P2_S9	To that end, in fiscal 2012 we opened 13 full-price stores and four outlet stores and began retail operations in three new states.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P2_S10	We partnered with Dillard s to launch our products in 65 locations.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P2_S11	We also introduced our brand in Japan through a combination of pop-up stores and the launch of a Japanese-language website.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P2_S12	We also began an expansion of approximately 200,000 square-feet of our distribution facility in Roanoke, Indiana.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P2_S13	We believe the combination of our expanding product offerings and continued growth in underpenetrated markets will lead to meaningful growth opportunities in the coming years.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	We expect our full-price stores to average approximately 1,800 square feet per store, and we expect to invest approximately $0.4 million per new store, consisting of inventory costs, pre-opening costs and build-out costs less tenant-improvement allowances.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	New full-price stores are expected to generate on average between $1.1 million and $1.3 million in net revenues during the first twelve months, and the payback on our investment is expected to occur in less than 18 months.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Typically, we have found that, as a new store becomes better integrated into its community and brand awareness grows, the store s productivity tends to improve as measured by comparable-store sales.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	We believe our business strategy will continue to offer significant opportunity, but it also presents risks and challenges.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	These risks and challenges include that we may not be able to effectively predict and respond to changing fashion trends and customer preferences, that we may not be able to find desirable locations for new stores, and that we may not be able to effectively manage our future growth.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	Addressing these risks could divert our attention from continuing to build on the strengths that we believe have driven the growth of our business, but we believe our focus on brand identity, customer loyalty, a distinctive shopping experience, product development expertise, and company culture will contribute positively to our results.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	How We Assess the Performance of Our Business In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Net Revenues Net revenues reflect revenues from the sale of our merchandise and from distribution and shipping and handling fees, less returns and discounts.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Revenues for the Direct segment reflect sales through our full-price and outlet stores, pop-up stores in Japan, our websites, verabradley.com and verabradley.co.jp, and our annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	Revenues for the Indirect segment reflect sales to Indirect specialty retailers and department stores.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P6_S3	Comparable-Store Sales Comparable-store sales are calculated based upon our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the reporting period.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P6_S4	Remodeled stores are included in comparable-store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales differently than we do.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	As a result, data in this report regarding our comparable-store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other companies.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Non-comparable store sales include sales from stores not included in comparable-store sales.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	Measuring the change in year-over-year comparable-store sales allows us to evaluate how our store base is performing.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	Various factors affect our comparable-store sales, including:
1495320_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	The timing and success of promotional and advertising efforts.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	Gross Profit Gross profit is equal to our net revenues less our cost of sales.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Cost of sales includes the direct cost of purchased and manufactured merchandise, distribution center costs, operations overhead, duty, and all inbound freight costs incurred.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	The components of our reported cost of sales may not be comparable to those of other retail and wholesale companies.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Gross profit can be impacted by changes in volume, operational efficiencies, such as leveraging of fixed costs, promotional activities, such as free shipping, commodity prices such as cotton, and fluctuations in pricing structures.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Prior to calendar year 2006, we sourced the majority of our finished products domestically.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	Today, the significant majority of our products are sourced internationally.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	During this same period, we began direct sourcing of our raw materials and brought management of logistics in-house.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	These sourcing changes, along with better cost management, contributed to improvements in gross margin over this period.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our net revenues.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	A expenses include selling; advertising, marketing, and product development; and administrative.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	Selling expenses include Direct business expenses such as store expenses, employee compensation, and store occupancy and supply costs, as well as Indirect business expenses consisting primarily of employee compensation and other expenses associated with sales to Indirect retailers.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P13_S3	Advertising, marketing, and product development expenses include employee compensation, media costs, creative production expenses, marketing agency fees, new product design costs, public relations expenses, and market research expenses.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P13_S4	A portion of our advertising expenses may be reimbursed by Indirect retailers, and such amount is classified as other income.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P13_S5	Administrative expenses include compensation costs for corporate functions, corporate headquarters occupancy costs, consulting and software expenses, and charitable donations.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P13_S6	SG A expenses increase as the number of stores increases, but not in the same proportion as the associated increase in revenues.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P13_S7	Other Income We support many of our Indirect retailers marketing efforts by distributing certain catalogs and promotional mailers to current and prospective customers.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P13_S8	Our Indirect retailers reimburse us for a portion of the cost to produce these materials.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P13_S9	Reimbursement received is recorded as other income.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P13_S10	The related cost to design, produce, and distribute the catalogs and mailers is recorded as SG A expense.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P13_S11	Other income also includes proceeds from the sales of tickets to our annual outlet sale and the gain on the sale of certain life insurance policies.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P13_S12	Operating Income Operating income equals gross profit less SG A expenses plus other income.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P13_S13	Operating income excludes interest income, interest expense, and income taxes.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	(subject to exception in a limited number of state and local jurisdictions that do not recognize the S Corporation status).
1495320_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	On October 3, 2010, our S Corporation status automatically terminated and we became subject to corporate-level federal and state income taxes at prevailing corporate rates.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	The following tables summarize key components of our consolidated results of operations for the last three fiscal years, both in dollars and as a percentage of our net revenues:
1495320_12_ITEM7_P14_S3	The following tables present net revenues by operating segment, both in dollars and as a percentage of our net revenues, and full-price store data for the last three fiscal years:
1495320_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	(1) Includes only our full-price and outlet stores.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	Our first full-price store opened in mid-September 2007 and our first outlet store opened in November 2009.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	(2) Comparable-store sales are the net revenues of our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the period.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	Increase or decrease is reported as a percentage of the comparable-store sales for the same period in the prior fiscal year.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	Remodeled stores are included in comparable-store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Average net revenues per gross square foot are calculated by dividing total net revenues for our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the period by total gross square footage for those stores.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Net Revenues For fiscal 2012, net revenues increased $94.8 million, or 26.0%, to $460.8 million, from $366.1 million for fiscal 2011, primarily due to increased volume.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	For fiscal 2012, net revenues increased $74.2 million, or 49.1%, to $225.3 million, from $151.1 million for fiscal 2011.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	This growth resulted from a $28.6 million increase in e-commerce revenues due primarily to greater traffic resulting from marketing initiatives, a $39.4 million increase in non-comparable store sales, and a $6.2 million, or 10.9%, increase in comparable-store sales.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P17_S4	The number of our stores grew from 39 at the end of fiscal 2011 to 56 at the end of fiscal 2012.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P17_S5	For fiscal 2012, net revenues increased $20.6 million, or 9.6%, to $235.6 million, from $214.9 million for fiscal 2011, due to increased sales volume to our specialty retailers, driven by strong demand for carryover patterns, fall product assortment, and the launch of rolling luggage.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P17_S6	Gross Profit For fiscal 2012, gross profit increased $48.5 million, or 23.2%, to $257.6 million, from $209.1 million for fiscal 2011.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P17_S7	As a percentage of net revenues, gross profit decreased to 55.9% for fiscal 2012, from 57.1% for fiscal 2011.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P17_S8	The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to higher cotton and labor costs and higher sales of certain retired inventory sold at lower than normal gross margins, partially offset by an overall revenue mix shift toward higher margin, retail-store sales and e-commerce.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P17_S9	For fiscal 2012, SG A expenses increased $6.3 million, or 3.9%, to $169.4 million, from $163.1 million for fiscal 2011.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P17_S10	As a percentage of net revenues, SG A expenses were 36.8% and 44.5% for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, respectively.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P17_S11	The decrease as a percentage of net revenues in SG A expenses was due primarily to $21.9 million of compensation expense related to restricted-stock awards and a decline in professional fees related to our transition from a private to a public company both of which were included in fiscal 2011.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P17_S12	In addition, SG A expenses declined as a percentage of net revenues due to leverage of our relatively fixed cost structure of the Indirect segment, partially offset by our investment into the Japanese market.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	Other Income For fiscal 2012, other income increased $0.8 million, or 10.4%, to $8.0 million, from $7.2 million for fiscal 2011, due primarily to increased reimbursement of our advertising expenses by our specialty retailers.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	The increase was due in part to sales of tickets to our annual outlet sale and the gain on the sale of certain life insurance policies.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	Operating Income For fiscal 2012, operating income increased $42.9 million, or 80.4%, to $96.2 million, from $53.3 million for fiscal 2011.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P18_S3	As a percentage of net revenues, operating income was 20.9% and 14.6% for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, respectively.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P18_S4	This increase as a percentage of net revenues was due primarily to the $21.9 million of compensation expense related to restricted-stock awards in the prior year.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P18_S5	Excluding this compensation expense in the prior year, operating income as a percentage of sales increased due to sales-driven leverage of SG A on our high growth of net revenues, partially offset by higher cotton and labor prices and our investment into the Japanese market (in thousands): Direct .
1495320_12_ITEM7_P18_S6	For fiscal 2012, operating income increased $21.7 million, or 46.6%, due to an increase in gross profit, offset in part by increased selling expenses related to store operational costs and costs associated with our market entry into Japan.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P18_S7	For fiscal 2012, operating income increased $1.4 million, or 1.5%, primarily from an increase in revenue and sales-driven leverage of SG A, offset in part by a decline in gross margin, as previously discussed.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P18_S8	For fiscal 2012, unallocated expenses decreased $19.8 million, or 23.4%, primarily as a result of stock-based compensation expense and bonuses paid to recipients of restricted-stock awards in the prior-year period.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P18_S9	Interest Expense, Net For the fiscal year ended January 28, 2012, net interest expense decreased $0.5 million, or 29.5%, to $1.1 million, from $1.6 million in the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P18_S10	The decrease of $0.5 million was due primarily to a write off in the same period of the prior-year of $0.2 million of unamortized debt-issuance costs in connection with the amendment and restatement of the credit agreement.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P18_S11	The remaining $0.3 million was attributable to lower average borrowing rates in the fiscal year ended January 28, 2012.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P18_S12	Income Tax Expense For fiscal 2012, we recorded income tax expense of $37.1 million at an effective tax rate of 39.0%, which is consistent with U.S. federal and state statutory rates.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P18_S13	The change in our effective tax rate from fiscal 2011 reflects a more normalized rate due to being subject to corporate-level U.S. federal and state income taxes for the full fiscal year.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P18_S14	The effective tax rate also reflects a loss for the Japanese operations for which a tax benefit was not recognized.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	For fiscal 2011, we recorded income tax expense of $5.5 million.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	This expense was comprised of (1) $6.8 million of expense related to activity during the portion of fiscal 2011 that we were a C Corporation (October 3, 2010, through January 29, 2011) at an effective tax rate of 51.2% and (2) $0.5 million of state taxes related to taxing jurisdictions that did not recognize our previous S Corporation status, offset in part by a one-time deferred tax benefit of $1.8 million recognized upon the termination of our S Corporation status.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	Included in tax expense for the portion of the fiscal year that we operated as a C Corporation was $1.2 million related to permanently non-deductible stock-based compensation expense associated with restricted-stock awards that vested in connection with our initial public offering.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net Revenues For fiscal 2011, net revenues increased $77.2 million, or 26.7%, to $366.1 million, from $288.9 million for fiscal 2010.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	For fiscal 2011, net revenues increased $22.1 million, or 11.5%, to $214.9 million, from $192.8 million for fiscal 2010, due primarily to increased sales volume to our Indirect retailers.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	The increased sales volume resulted primarily from greater demand for our Signature Collection releases that, in most cases, had more patterns and styles relative to fiscal 2010 releases, increased offerings and sales of non-Signature Collection products, and improved economic conditions.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P20_S3	For fiscal 2011, net revenues increased $55.0 million, or 57.2%, to $151.1 million, from $96.1 million for fiscal 2010.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P20_S4	This growth resulted from a $22.8 million increase in e-commerce revenues due primarily to greater traffic resulting from marketing initiatives, a $22.6 million increase in non-comparable store sales, and a $7.3 million, or 25.8%, increase in comparable-store sales due primarily to increased store traffic.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P20_S5	The number of our stores grew from 27 at the end of fiscal 2010 to 39 at the end of fiscal 2011.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P20_S6	In addition, our annual outlet sale revenues increased by $2.3 million due to an increase in the number of shoppers that attended the sale and higher average product pricing at the sale.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P20_S7	Gross Profit For fiscal 2011, gross profit increased $58.0 million, or 38.4%, to $209.1 million, from $151.1 million for fiscal 2010.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P20_S8	As a percentage of net revenues, gross profit increased to 57.1% for fiscal 2011, from 52.3% for fiscal 2010.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P20_S9	The increase in gross margin was due primarily to increased leverage of fixed costs as a result of the volume growth, improved efficiency in our utilization of raw materials as a result of our expanding outlet store channel, higher average product pricing at the annual outlet sale, and an overall revenue mix shift toward higher margin, retail-store sales.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	For fiscal 2011, SG A expenses increased $46.9 million, or 40.4%, to $163.1 million, from $116.2 million for fiscal 2010.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	As a percentage of net revenues, SG A expenses were 44.5% and 40.2% for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	For fiscal 2011, selling expenses increased $19.9 million, or 36.0%, to $75.3 million, from $55.4 million for fiscal 2010.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P21_S3	As a percentage of net revenues, selling expenses were 20.6% and 19.2% for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P21_S4	The increase in selling expenses was due primarily to increased store operational costs attributable to new store openings as well as e-commerce and store marketing initiatives to drive increased traffic.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P21_S5	The increase in selling expenses also resulted from the company holding two product introduction and educational events (or Premieres) for Indirect retailers during fiscal 2011, compared to only one event during fiscal 2010, and from other increased expenses as a result of the increase in net revenues.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P21_S6	These increases were partially offset by a $1.3 million asset-impairment charge, as further described below, recorded in fiscal 2010.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P21_S7	No such charge was recorded in fiscal 2011.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	For fiscal 2011, advertising, marketing, and product development expenses decreased $1.1 million, or 3.7%, to $28.7 million, from $29.8 million for fiscal 2010.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	As a percentage of net revenues, advertising, marketing, and product development expenses were 7.8% and 10.3% for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	This decrease resulted primarily from reduced expenses associated with our co-op marketing programs as a result of refining the marketing support for our Indirect retailers.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P22_S3	These reduced expenses were offset in part by increased spending on non-co-op advertising and marketing efforts and by higher employee and other costs associated with our expanded product design capabilities and with the increase in net revenues.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P22_S4	For fiscal 2011, administrative expenses increased $28.1 million, or 90.7%, to $59.0 million, from $30.9 million for fiscal 2010.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P22_S5	As a percentage of net revenues, administrative expenses were 16.1% and 10.7% for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P22_S6	This increase was due primarily to $15.8 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the vesting of restricted-stock awards in connection with our initial public offering as well as $6.1 million of expense associated with bonuses paid to recipients of the restricted-stock awards to satisfy tax obligations.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P22_S7	In addition, we incurred higher corporate personnel and other costs necessary to support our growth as well as increased professional services fees related in part to our transition from a private to a public company.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P22_S8	Other Income For fiscal 2012, other income decreased $3.5 million, or 32.7%, to $7.2 million, from $10.7 million for fiscal 2010.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P22_S9	This decrease was due to the above-discussed refinement of the marketing support for our Indirect retailers, which resulted in decreased reimbursement of our advertising expenses.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Operating Income For fiscal 2011, operating income increased $7.6 million, or 16.6%, to $53.3 million, from $45.7 million for fiscal 2010.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	As a percentage of net revenues, operating income was 14.6% and 15.8% for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	This decrease in operating income as a percentage of net revenues was due primarily to the previously discussed $15.8 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the vesting of restricted-stock awards in connection with our initial public offering and the $6.1 million of expense associated with bonuses paid to recipients of the restricted-stock awards.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P23_S3	Operating income for our business segments is provided below.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P23_S4	Indirect For fiscal 2011, operating income increased $19.1 million, or 26.2%, primarily as a result of the previously discussed increase in gross profit.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P23_S5	This increase was partially offset by increased selling expenses, as previously discussed.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P23_S6	For fiscal 2011, operating income increased $21.1 million, or 83.7%, primarily as a result of the previously discussed increase in gross profit.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P23_S7	This increase was partially offset by increased selling expenses, as previously discussed.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	For fiscal 2011, unallocated expenses increased $32.6 million, or 62.4%, primarily as a result of increased stock-based and bonus compensation expenses, higher corporate personnel and other costs, and increased professional services fees, as previously discussed.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense was consistent for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010; a $0.2 million write off of unamortized debt-issuance costs in connection with the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement was offset by lower average borrowing levels during fiscal 2011.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	Income Tax Expense For fiscal 2011, we recorded income tax expense of $5.5 million.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P24_S3	This expense was comprised of (1) $6.8 million of expense related to activity during the portion of fiscal 2011 that we were a C Corporation (October 3, 2010, through January 29, 2011) at an effective tax rate of 51.2% and (2) $0.5 million of state taxes related to taxing jurisdictions that did not recognize our previous S Corporation status, offset in part by a one-time deferred tax benefit of $1.8 million recognized upon the termination of our S Corporation status.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P24_S4	Included in tax expense for the portion of the fiscal year that we operated as a C Corporation was $1.2 million related to permanently non-deductible stock-based compensation expense associated with restricted-stock awards that vested in connection with our initial public offering.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P24_S5	For fiscal 2010, our income tax expense of $0.9 million (calculated at an effective rate of 2.0%) was comprised solely of state taxes related to taxing jurisdictions that did not recognize our previous S Corporation status.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P24_S6	The increase in our effective tax rate resulted from our change in tax status.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	We also have access to additional liquidity, if needed, through borrowings under our $125.0 million amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Historically, our primary cash needs have been for merchandise inventories, payroll, store rent, capital expenditures associated with opening new stores, debt repayments, operational equipment, and information technology.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	The most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, merchandise inventories, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current liabilities.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	We do not believe that the expansion of our Direct business will materially alter the nature and levels of our accounts receivable and inventories, or require materially increased borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement, in the near term.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P26_S3	We believe that cash flows from operating activities and the availability of borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement or other financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, and debt payments for the foreseeable future.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P26_S4	Cash Flow Analysis A summary of operating, investing, and financing activities is shown in the following table (in thousands):
1495320_12_ITEM7_P26_S5	Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation, the effect of changes in assets and liabilities, and tenant-improvement allowances received from landlords under our store leases.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities was $51.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2012 primarily driven by our net income in the current year.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	This is slightly down from $58.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011, primarily due to additional income tax payments of $42.9 million in the current year because of the conversion from an S Corporation to a C Corporation in the prior year making us subject to corporate-level U.S. federal and state income taxes.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	In addition, cash flow decreased due to timing of payments to our vendors, which was more than offset by the improvements in our supply chain and inventory management processes which allowed inventory levels to grow much less than the prior year.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	Net cash provided by operating activities declined to $58.5 million in fiscal 2011, from $66.0 million in fiscal 2010.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P27_S4	This decrease was driven primarily by a $17.2 million increase in cash outflows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities and a $5.4 million increase in net deferred tax assets, offset in part by an increase of $15.9 million in stock-based compensation expense.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P27_S5	The increase in cash outflows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from a $30.2 million increase in inventories, partially offset by increased current liabilities related in part to inventory purchases and C Corporation tax obligations.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for growth related to new store openings, operational equipment, and information technology investments.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Net cash used in investing activities was $18.8 million in fiscal 2012, compared to $9.9 million in fiscal 2011.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	The $8.9 million increase in capital expenditures was driven primarily by the investments in new stores, including the opening of 17 stores during fiscal 2012, expansion of the distribution facility, and information technology investments.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P28_S3	Net cash used in investing activities was $9.9 million in fiscal 2011, reflecting capital expenditures of $11.4 million offset in part by $1.5 million of cash provided as a result of the elimination of a compensating-balance requirement in connection with the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P28_S4	Capital expenditures of $11.4 million for fiscal 2011 were $5.5 million higher than capital expenditures in fiscal 2010, due primarily to increased investments in new stores, including the opening of twelve stores in fiscal 2011 compared to six stores during fiscal 2010, and incremental investments in information technology and distribution assets.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P28_S5	Net cash used in investing activities was $5.8 million in fiscal 2010.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P28_S6	This was driven by $3.6 million in investments in six new stores along with improvements in e-commerce, $0.4 million in information technology investments, and $1.1 million in production and distribution equipment.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P28_S7	Capital expenditures for fiscal 2013 are expected to be approximately $36.0 million, including the build-out of new stores and approximately $19.0 million of spending related to the distribution center expansion.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P28_S8	Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $41.8 million in fiscal 2012, resulting from the net payments under our amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P28_S9	Net cash used in financing activities was $41.2 million in fiscal 2011, driven primarily by $132.8 million of S Corporation distributions (including the final S Corporation distribution of $106.0 million) and $1.1 million of debt-issuance costs, offset in part by IPO net proceeds of $56.3 million and net borrowings of $36.8 million under the credit agreement or amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P28_S10	Net cash used in financing activities was $54.4 million in fiscal 2010.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P28_S11	This included $24.5 million in net repayments of borrowings under our credit agreement, $4.3 million in repayments of vendor and related-party debt, and $25.6 million in distributions to our shareholders to fund tax liabilities due to our S Corporation status.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On October 4, 2010, Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. entered into an agreement to amend and restate its credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, as administrative agent, and certain other lenders.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	The amended and restated credit agreement provides for a revolving credit commitment of $125.0 million and matures on October 3, 2015.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	All borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of the Company s assets.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P29_S3	The credit agreement is also guaranteed by the Company.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P29_S4	The credit agreement requires the Company to comply with various financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.20 to 1.00 and a leverage ratio of not more than 3.50 to 1.00.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P29_S5	The agreement also contains various other covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of certain indebtedness, liens, investments, acquisitions, and asset sales.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P29_S6	The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of January 28, 2012.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	Borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement bear interest at either LIBOR plus the applicable margin (ranging from 1.05% to 2.05%) or the alternate base rate (as defined in the agreement) plus the applicable margin (ranging from 0.05% to 1.05%).
1495320_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	The applicable margin is tied to the Company s leverage ratio.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	In addition, the Company is required to pay a quarterly facility fee (as defined in the agreement) ranging from 0.20% to 0.45% of the revolving credit commitment.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P30_S3	At January 28, 2012, the weighted-average interest rate on the $25.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement was 1.68%.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P30_S4	The Company had borrowing availability of $100.0 million under the agreement as of January 28, 2012.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	We enter into long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily debt obligations and non-cancellable operating leases.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	As of January 28, 2012, our contractual cash obligations over the next several periods are as follows:
1495320_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	(1) As of January 28, 2012, we had $25.0 million principal amount due on October 3, 2015 under our amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	Estimated total interest and facility fee payments of $2.1 million, due through October 3, 2015, based on our outstanding borrowings and the interest rates in effect under our amended and restated credit agreement as of January 28, 2012, have been excluded.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	(2) We have entered into financing agreements with certain vendors.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	The amounts listed represent the outstanding balances under these agreements.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	(3) Our store leases generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and provide us with the option to renew the leases upon substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	Our future operating lease obligations would change if we were to exercise these options, or if we were to enter into new operating leases.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	(4) Purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchase orders and include the expansion of our distribution facility in Roanoke, Indiana.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	In addition, due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our uncertain tax positions at January 28, 2012, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	Therefore, $0.9 million of uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosures relating to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	We evaluate our accounting policies, estimates, and judgments on an on-going basis.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P38_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P38_S4	We evaluate the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and believe that the following policies and estimates involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position, and are therefore discussed as critical.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	The following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent results of operations.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	Our historical results for the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, however, have not been materially impacted by such variances.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	More information on all of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from the sale of our products is recognized upon customer receipt of the product when collection of the associated receivables is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and ownership and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, which, for e-commerce and most Indirect sales, reflects an estimate of shipments that customers have not yet received.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	The estimate of these shipments is based on shipping terms and historical delivery times.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	Significant changes in shipping terms or delivery times could materially impact our revenues in a given period.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	We reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Merchandise returns are often resalable merchandise and in the Direct business are refunded by issuing the same payment tender of the original purchase and in the Indirect business the customer is issued a credit to its account to apply to outstanding invoices.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	Merchandise exchanges of the same product at the same price are not considered merchandise returns.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	Product returns are often resalable through our annual outlet sale or other channels.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P43_S3	Additionally, we reserve for other potential product credits and for customer shipments not yet received.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P43_S4	The total reserve for returns, customer shipments not yet received, and general credits was $2.6 million and $1.7 million at January 28, 2012, and January 29, 2011, respectively.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P43_S5	This represents a reduction to operating income of $1.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	Market is determined based on net realizable value, which includes costs to dispose.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P44_S3	Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excess quantities, and other factors, including the popularity of a pattern or product, in evaluating net realizable value.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	We record valuation adjustments to our inventories, which are reflected in cost of sales, if the cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	and inventory levels, including sell-through of remaining units.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	In addition, as part of inventory adjustments, we provide for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from our physical inventory counts.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	We perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrink provision accordingly.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P46_S3	Inventory adjustments of $3.3 million and $5.1 million were recorded for these matters as of January 28, 2012, and January 29, 2011, respectively.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P46_S4	These adjustments related primarily to raw materials of discontinued patterns, as we have the ability to move discontinued finished goods through a number of channels, including the annual outlet sale, our website and outlet stores, and through liquidators as needed.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P46_S5	The decrease in the valuation adjustments during fiscal 2012 resulted primarily from our expanding outlet store channel, which we launched in November 2009 which has enabled us to increase our use of raw materials of discontinued patterns as well as an improved cycle counting process resulting in less shrink.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	Income Taxes Prior to October 3, 2010, we were taxed as an S Corporation for federal income tax purposes under Section 1362 of the Internal Revenue Code, and therefore were not subject to federal and state income taxes (subject to exception in a limited number of state and local jurisdictions that do not recognize the S Corporation status).
1495320_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	On October 3, 2010, our S Corporation status automatically terminated and we became subject to corporate-level federal and state income taxes at prevailing corporate rates.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	Our effective tax rate is based on our pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P47_S3	Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P47_S4	We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained; (2) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	Taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	We believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	Taxing authorities, however, may take a contrary position.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P48_S3	Our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if, upon final resolution with taxing authorities, we prevail in positions for which we have established reserves, or are required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	Valuation of Long-lived Assets Property, plant, and equipment assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	In evaluating an asset for recoverability, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset at the store level, the lowest identifiable level of cash flow, if applicable.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset is less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, usually determined by an estimated discounted cash flow analysis of the asset.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	Factors used in the valuation of long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, our plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results, and projected future cash flows.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	With respect to our stores, we analyze store economics, location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies in our selection process.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Impairment charges are classified in SG A expenses.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	The discounted cash flow models used to estimate the applicable fair values involve numerous estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	Changes to these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the fair value estimates.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	The estimates and assumptions critical to the overall fair value estimates include: (1) estimated future cash flow generated at the store level; and (2) discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair values.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P54_S3	These and other estimates and assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and our expectations and may change in the future based on period-specific facts and circumstances.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P54_S4	If economic conditions were to deteriorate, future impairment charges may be required.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2011-05, Comprehensive Income Presentation of Comprehensive Income .
1495320_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	This guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the Statement of Shareholders Equity.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	Instead, the Company must report comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections, net income and other comprehensive income, or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P55_S3	While the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income, there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P55_S4	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P55_S5	As this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, the adoption will not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P55_S6	Early adoption is permitted, but full retrospective application is required under both sets of accounting standards.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P55_S7	The guidance also previously required the presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented; however, this portion of the guidance has been deferred through an ASU issued in September 2011.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	Upon adoption, the Company will elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement, the statement of comprehensive income.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-4, Fair Value Measurement Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS .
1495320_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	The guidance requires additional disclosures, including disclosures related to the measurement of level 3 assets.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and is applied prospectively.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P57_S3	The Company is currently evaluating this guidance, but does not expect its adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	Transactions with Related Parties See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, of this report for information regarding transactions with related parties.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement, which bear interest at variable rates.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	The amended and restated credit agreement allows for a revolving credit commitment of $125.0 million, bearing interest at a variable rate, based on either LIBOR plus the applicable margin (ranging from 1.05% to 2.05%) or the alternate base rate (as defined in the agreement) plus the applicable margin (ranging from 0.05% to 1.05%).
1495320_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	Assuming the amended and restated credit agreement is fully drawn, each quarter point increase or decrease in the interest rate would change our annual interest expense by approximately $0.3 million.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	From time to time, we utilize interest rate swaps to hedge our interest rate risk.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	We had no open derivative instruments at January 28, 2012.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	Impact of Inflation Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	Although it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We source a substantial majority of our materials from various suppliers in China and South Korea.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	Substantially all purchases and sales involving foreign persons are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore we do not hedge using any derivative instruments.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	Historically, we have not been impacted materially by changes in exchange rates.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vera Bradley, Inc.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Vera Bradley, Inc. and its subsidiaries at January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P65_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1495320_12_ITEM7_P65_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P65_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits (which was an integrated audit in 2012).
1495320_12_ITEM7_P65_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1495320_12_ITEM7_P65_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P65_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P65_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P65_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P65_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P66_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1495320_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	Description of the Company Vera Bradley, Inc. was formed as an Indiana corporation on June 23, 2010, for the purpose of reorganizing the corporate structure of Vera Bradley Designs, Inc.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	On October 3, 2010, the shareholders of Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. contributed all of their shares of Class A Voting Common Stock and Class B Non-Voting Common Stock of Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. to Vera Bradley, Inc. in return for shares of Vera Bradley, Inc.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P71_S2	Class A Voting Common Stock and Class B Non-Voting Common Stock on a one-for-one basis.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P71_S3	In addition, effective October 3, 2010, Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. converted from an S Corporation to a C Corporation for income-tax purposes.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P71_S4	Further, on October 18, 2010, Vera Bradley, Inc. recapitalized all of its Class A Voting Common Stock and Class B Non-Voting Common Stock into a single class of common stock and effectuated a 35.437-for-1 stock split of all outstanding shares of its common stock.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P71_S5	These events collectively are referred to as the Reorganization.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P71_S6	As a result of the Reorganization, Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Vera Bradley, Inc.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P71_S7	Except where context requires or where otherwise indicated, the terms Company and Vera Bradley refer to Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. and its subsidiaries before the Reorganization and to Vera Bradley, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Vera Bradley Designs, Inc., after the Reorganization.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P71_S8	All historical common stock and per share common stock information has been changed to reflect the stock split.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	Vera Bradley is a leading designer, producer, marketer, and retailer of stylish, highly functional accessories for women.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	The Company s products include a wide offering of handbags, accessories, and travel and leisure items.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	The Company generates net revenues by selling products through two reportable segments: Direct and Indirect.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P72_S3	The Direct business consists of sales of Vera Bradley products through the Company s full-price stores, outlet stores, verabradley.com, and an annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P72_S4	As of January 28, 2012, the Company operated 48 full-price stores and eight outlet stores in the United States, seven pop-up stores in Japan, our websites, verabradley.com and verabradley.co.jp, and our annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Indirect business consists of sales of Vera Bradley products to approximately 3,300 specialty retailers, substantially all of which are located in the United States, as well as select national retailers and third-party e-commerce sites.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	The Company has eliminated intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P74_S2	The Company s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P74_S3	Unaudited Pro Forma Income Information Prior to the Reorganization, the Company was taxed as an S Corporation for purposes of federal and state income taxes.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P74_S4	Accordingly, each of the Company s then-shareholders was required to include his or her portion of the Company s taxable income or loss on his or her federal and state income tax returns.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P74_S5	As part of the Reorganization, effective October 3, 2010, the Company s S Corporation status automatically terminated and the Company became subject to corporate-level federal and state income taxes at prevailing corporate rates.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P74_S6	The unaudited pro forma income information gives effect to an adjustment for income tax expense as if the Company had been a C Corporation at the beginning of each period presented at an assumed combined federal, state, and local income tax rate of 41.7% for the period from January 31, 2010, through October 2, 2010, and 40% for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2010.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P74_S7	These rates approximate the calculated effective tax rates for the periods presented.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the Company s assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosures relating to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	Significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include the valuation of inventories, accounts receivable valuation allowances, sales return allowances, and the useful lives of assets for depreciation or amortization.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P75_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P75_S3	The Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents represent cash on hand, deposits with financial institutions, and investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	Restricted Cash At January 30, 2010, the Company maintained $1.5 million in an account with one of its lenders as a compensating balance in connection with the credit agreement entered into during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P76_S2	In October 2010, as part of the amendment and restatement of the Company s credit agreement (see Note 5), this compensating-balance requirement was eliminated.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P76_S3	Concentration of Credit Risk The Company maintains nearly all of its cash and cash equivalents with one financial institution.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P76_S4	The Company monitors the credit standing of this financial institution on a regular basis.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P77_S2	Market is determined based on net realizable value, which includes costs to dispose.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P77_S3	Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excess quantities, and other factors, including the popularity of a pattern or product, in evaluating net realizable value.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are carried at cost and depreciated or amortized over the following estimated useful lives using the straight-line method:
1495320_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the asset or the lease term.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	Lease terms typically range from five to ten years.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	When a decision is made to abandon property, plant, and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life, depreciation or amortization estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	At the time of disposal, the cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting loss is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	Property, plant, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	The reviews are conducted at the lowest identifiable level of cash flows.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the property, plant, and equipment are less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, as further defined below in Fair Value of Financial Instruments.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	Routine maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	The Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with acquiring, modifying, and installing internal-use software.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	Capitalized costs are included in property, plant, and equipment and are amortized over three to five years.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P84_S2	Software costs that do not meet capitalization criteria are expensed as incurred.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Revenue from the sale of the Company s products is recognized upon customer receipt of the product when collection of the associated receivables is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and ownership and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, which, for e-commerce and most Indirect sales, reflects an estimate of shipments that customers have not yet received.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	The estimate of these shipments is based on shipping terms and historical delivery times.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	Included in net revenues are product sales to Direct and Indirect customers, including amounts billed to customers for shipping fees.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	Costs related to shipping of product are classified in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P86_S2	Net revenues exclude sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	Historical experience provides the Company the ability to estimate reasonably the amount of product sales that customers will return.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	Product returns are often resalable through the Company s annual outlet sale or other channels.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P87_S2	The Company accounts for anticipated returns by reducing net revenues, cost of sales, and accounts receivable and increasing inventories, essentially reversing the effects of the original sales transactions.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P87_S3	Additionally, the Company reserves for other potential product credits granted to Indirect retailers.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P87_S4	The returns and credits reserve and the related activity for each fiscal year presented were as follows (in thousands):
1495320_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and customer-specific identification and believes that collections of receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, are reasonably assured.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $0.6 million and $0.3 million at January 28, 2012, and January 29, 2011, respectively.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes material and labor costs, freight, inventory shrinkage, operating lease costs, duty, and other operating expenses, including depreciation of the Company s distribution center, warehouse and manufacturing facilities, and equipment.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	Costs and related expenses to manufacture and distribute the products are recorded as cost of sales when the related revenues are recognized.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	The Company has leases that contain rent holidays and predetermined, fixed escalations of minimum rentals.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	For each of these leases, the Company recognizes the related rent expense on a straight-line basis commencing on the date of initial possession of the leased property.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P90_S2	The Company records the difference between the recognized rent expense and the amount payable under the lease as a deferred lease credit.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	The Company receives tenant-improvement allowances from some of the landlords of its leased properties.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P91_S1	These allowances generally are in the form of cash received by the Company from its landlords as part of the negotiated lease terms.

1495320_12_ITEM7_P98_S1	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified using the following hierarchy, which is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation as of the measurement date:
1495320_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	The classification of fair value measurements within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement.

1495320_12_ITEM7_P102_S1	This guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the Statement of Shareholders Equity.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P102_S2	Instead, the Company must report comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections, net income and other comprehensive income, or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P102_S3	While the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income, there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P102_S4	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P102_S5	As this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, the adoption will not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P102_S6	Early adoption is permitted, but full retrospective application is required under both sets of accounting standards.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P102_S7	The guidance also previously required the presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented; however, this portion of the guidance has been deferred through an ASU issued in September 2011.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	Upon adoption, the Company will elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement, the statement of comprehensive income.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-4, Fair Value Measurement Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS .
1495320_12_ITEM7_P104_S1	The guidance requires additional disclosures, including disclosures related to the measurement of level 3 assets.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P104_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and is applied prospectively.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P104_S3	The Company is currently evaluating this guidance, but does not expect its adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

1495320_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the property, plant, and equipment are less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, as further defined in Note 2.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P108_S1	An impairment charge of $1.3 million was recognized in the fiscal year ended January 30, 2010, for assets related to underperforming stores and is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income and in depreciation and amortization of property, plant, and equipment in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

1495320_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	Borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement bear interest at either LIBOR plus the applicable margin (ranging from 1.05% to 2.05%) or the alternate base rate (as defined in the agreement) plus the applicable margin (ranging from 0.05% to 1.05%).
1495320_12_ITEM7_P112_S1	The applicable margin is tied to the Company s leverage ratio.

1495320_12_ITEM7_P116_S0	Vera Bradley, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements During fiscal year 2012, the Company began retail operations in Japan.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P116_S1	During the first 12 months of operations, these retail activities incurred a loss.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P116_S2	The Company has not recorded a tax benefit for this loss due to the uncertainty regarding the future realizability of the tax benefit of this loss.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P116_S3	Accordingly, a valuation allowance of $0.6 million was recorded for the Japanese entity.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P116_S4	If not used, this carryforward will expire in fiscal year 2019.

1495320_12_ITEM7_P117_S1	As a result of the conversation to a C Corporation, the Company recorded a net deferred tax asset and one-time deferred tax benefit of $1.8 million.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P117_S2	This benefit of $1.8 million reflects the company s original estimate of the one-time benefit as well as changes to that estimate resulting from intervening enactments of depreciation-related tax legislation and the Company s completion of its final S Corporation tax return.
1495320_12_ITEM7_P117_S3	In addition, during the portion of the year in which it operated as a C Corporation, the company recognized stock-based compensation expense associated with restricted-stock awards, a portion of which was permanently non-deductible, the tax impact of which was $1.2 million.

1495320_12_ITEM7_P118_S1	It is unlikely that any of total unrecognized tax benefits as of January 28, 2012, will change in the next twelve months.

1495320_13_ITEM1_P29_S2	We believe there are significant opportunities to expand our business and increase our net revenues and net income through the execution of the following growth strategies: Grow in Underpenetrated Markets.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P29_S3	Our historic growth focused primarily on the eastern United States, and accordingly, the Vera Bradley brand is most recognized in that region.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P29_S4	In recent years, we have successfully expanded our Direct and Indirect channels in key developing markets, including in the Midwest and Southwest.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P29_S5	In addition, in fiscal 2012 we expanded internationally by entering the Japanese market.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	of our expansion efforts is a testament to the strength and portability of our brand and the power of our multi-channel distribution capabilities.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	We intend to utilize these strengths to further penetrate our existing markets and successfully expand our business into other foreign markets and relatively underpenetrated U.S. markets.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P30_S2	We plan to expand our retail presence in the United States by opening new stores.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P30_S3	We believe that the market in the United States can support at least 300 Vera Bradley full-price stores.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P30_S4	We plan to open approximately 20 new stores annually during each of the next five fiscal years.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P30_S5	Drive Comparable-Store Sales and Our E-Commerce Business.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P30_S6	We have several ongoing initiatives to drive comparable-store sales growth, including focusing on store-level merchandising programs and enhancing in-store customer service and selling capabilities.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P30_S7	As a key element of our Direct channel strategy, we intend to grow our e-commerce business through focused marketing efforts, online merchandising initiatives, and social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P30_S8	We believe our retail and e-commerce businesses are complementary and facilitate frequent contact with our customers.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P30_S9	We design products to accessorize a woman s life and believe this core competence serves as a platform for growth within and beyond our current product lines.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P30_S10	We have expanded our product offerings to include new line extensions, such as focused gift and special occasion offerings, including this year s back to campus and tech accessory products, and brand extensions, such as our paper and stationery collection.

1495320_13_ITEM1_P30_S12	Within each season, we generally introduce two to four patterns.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P30_S13	These patterns are incorporated into the designs of a wide range of products, including handbags, accessories, and travel and leisure items, that are part of the core seasonal release.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P30_S14	These product assortments each season can be classic styles, updates to older designs, or new product introductions.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P30_S15	Between our seasonal offerings we introduce smaller assortments specific to a category (e.g., a Vera Bradley Baby gift assortment) or customer segment (e.g., a more fashion-forward resort collection).
1495320_13_ITEM1_P30_S16	To keep our assortment current and fresh and to focus our inventory investments on our best performers, we discontinue patterns at regular intervals.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P30_S17	We sell our remaining inventory of retired products primarily through our website, outlet stores, and at our annual outlet sale.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P30_S18	The following chart presents net revenues generated by each of our three product categories and other revenues as a percentage of our total net revenues for fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011:

1495320_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	(2) Excludes net revenues generated by our annual outlet sale.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	Handbags are a core part of our product offerings and are the primary component of every seasonal assortment.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	The category consists of classic and new styles developed by our product development team to meet consumer demand and drive repeat purchases.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	Our handbag product category extends beyond handbags to include totes and specialty bags such as crossbodies, baby bags, backpacks, and laptop portfolios.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	Handbags play a prominent role in our visual merchandising, and we focus on showcasing the different patterns, colors, and features of each bag.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	Accessories, our second largest revenue category, include technology accessories and fashion accessories such as wallets, wristlets, eyeglass cases, cosmetics cases, paper and gift products.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	Our accessories are attractively priced and allow the consumer to include some color in her wardrobe, even if tucked into another bag.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P35_S2	Our product development team consistently updates the accessories assortment based on consumer demand and fashion trends.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P35_S3	Our travel and leisure product category includes duffel bags, garment bags, rolling luggage, and travel accessories, such as travel cosmetic cases.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	The first Vera Bradley product offering included duffel bags, which consistently have been a strong performer.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	We believe their popularity, as well as the appeal of our other travel and leisure items, results from our vibrant designs, functional styles, and lightweight fabrications.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P36_S2	We have implemented a fully integrated and cross-functional product development process that aligns design, market research, merchandise management, sales, marketing, and sourcing.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P36_S3	Product development is a core capability that makes our products unique and provides us with a competitive advantage.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P36_S4	Our designs and aesthetics set our products apart and drive customer loyalty.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P36_S5	Our product development team mixes an understanding of the needs of our target customers with knowledge of upcoming color and fashion trends to design new collections as well as new product categories that will resonate in the market.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P36_S6	We typically begin the development stage of our products in the Vera Bradley portfolio 12 18 months in advance of their release.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P36_S7	The development of each new pattern includes the design of an overall print, a complementary fabric backing, and three sizes of coordinating trim materials.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P36_S8	To seek fresh perspectives, we collaborate with independent designers to create unique patterns for each season.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P36_S9	We oversee the development and exercise the final approval of all patterns and designs.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P36_S10	Once developed, we generally copyright each pattern, including the print, fabric backing and coordinating trim.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P36_S11	We believe that great design is not only central to our product development efforts, but also is a fundamental part of our brand development and growth strategies.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P36_S12	In the past several years, we have made investments to evolve and integrate our product development expertise, including opening a design office in New York City, as well as opening a design center in Roanoke, Indiana.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P36_S13	Our product development team works to ensure that new collections contain an assortment of products and styles that are in line with both fashion trends and customer needs and regularly updates classic styles to enhance functionality.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P36_S14	In addition, we actively pursue opportunities to expand our product offerings through new line and brand extensions.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P36_S15	Our product development team monitors fashion trends and customer needs by attending major trend shows in Europe and the United States, subscribing to trend monitoring services, and engaging in comparison-shopping.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P36_S16	Our product development team is also responsible for assortment planning, pricing, forecasting, promotional development, and product lifecycle management.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	Forecasting is based on seasonal market research and in-store testing.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	We gather seasonal market research through a variety of methodologies, including scheduled interviews and online and in-person surveys.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P37_S2	We conduct seasonal in-store testing by releasing test products in our full-price stores and evaluating their success in the marketplace prior to product introduction on a larger scale.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P37_S3	The team assures that we offer a broad range of patterns, fabrics, styles, and functionality features in a cost-effective manner.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P37_S4	We believe that with our cross-functional, collaborative approach, we are able to introduce and sell our merchandise in a way that clearly communicates the Vera Bradley brand and the Vera Bradley lifestyle.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	Marketing We believe that the growth of our brand and our business is influenced by our ability to introduce and sell our merchandise in a way that clearly conveys the Vera Bradley lifestyle.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	We use marketing as critical tools in our efforts to promote our brand.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P38_S2	The seasonal Vera Bradley catalogs are key vehicles for promoting the brand and product portfolio.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P38_S3	Each catalog is sent to a targeted customer mailing list.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P38_S4	In addition to distributing the catalog, we produce and distribute a number of other marketing pieces, including postcards and mini-mailers.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P38_S5	We believe our direct mail media generates excitement and awareness about the brand and seasonal introductions and allow us to reach both new and loyal customers in their homes.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P38_S6	We employ print and outdoor advertising to increase overall brand awareness.

1495320_13_ITEM1_P42_S1	We believe our outlet stores are an integral part of our distribution strategy, as this format provides an additional channel of distribution for our products and enables us to better target value-oriented customers.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P42_S2	Our outlet stores average approximately 3,000 square feet per store.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P42_S3	As of February 2, 2013, we operated 11 outlet stores.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	We launched a marketing campaign to connect with the Japanese consumer on April 18, 2011.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	This campaign included seven temporary pop-up stores in several department stores including Isetan Shinjuku and Marui Yurakucho located across Tokyo and Kyoto.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P43_S2	The international channel includes the Japanese website verabradley.co.jp launched in fiscal 2012.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P43_S3	During fiscal 2013, we increased our Japanese presence to a total of 15 department store locations.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P43_S4	Our annual outlet sale is held in the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum Exposition Center in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P43_S5	The annual outlet sale is an important tradition for Vera Bradley, has many loyal followers, and is an opportunity for us to sell our retired merchandise at discounted prices in a brand-right fashion.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P43_S6	We attracted more than 62,500 attendees to our 2012 annual outlet sale.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	Our store location decisions are made case by case, depending on the retail strategy we have developed for the particular market.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	This includes actual and planned penetration in both Indirect and Direct segments, as well as existing e-commerce demand.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P44_S2	At this time, we do not believe any market has been fully penetrated.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P44_S3	We believe that expansion of our store base complements our Indirect segment by increasing brand awareness and reinforcing our brand image.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	In addition to analyzing store economics, we pay particular attention to the location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	Along with seeking co-tenants that we believe share our target customer, we seek a balanced mix of moderate and high-end retailers to encourage high levels of traffic.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P45_S2	Our target full-price store size is approximately 1,800 square feet, but we are able to work with spaces as small as 1,000 square feet or, depending on our market strategy and relevant economic factors, spaces as large as 2,800 square feet.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	The focus of our store operations is providing consumers with a comfortable shopping experience.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	We strive to make the experience interactive through special store events, such as showcasing newly launched products or celebrating our namesake s birthday.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P46_S2	Our customer service philosophy emphasizes friendly service, merchandise knowledge, and passion for the brand.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P46_S3	Consequently, an essential requirement for the success of our stores is our ability to attract, train, and retain talented, highly motivated district managers, store managers, and sales associates.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P46_S4	Our district and store managers are our primary link to the consumer, and we continually invest in their development.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P46_S5	We believe that our innovative retail concept and distinctive retail experience contribute to the success of our stores, most of which generate strong productivity and returns.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P46_S6	We expect our full-price stores to average approximately 1,800 square feet per store, and we expect to invest approximately $0.4 million per new store, consisting of inventory costs, pre-opening costs, and build-out costs, less tenant-improvement allowances.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P46_S7	New full-price stores generate on average between $1.2 million and $1.4 million in net revenues during the first twelve months, and the payback on our investment is expected to occur in less than 18 months.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P46_S8	As of February 2, 2013, we had approximately 3,400 Indirect retailer partners, the majority of which were specialty retailers with whom we have had long-standing relationships.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	5.0% of total Indirect net revenues in fiscal 2013, with the top ten accounts representing in the aggregate less than 16.0% of total Indirect net revenues.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P47_S1	The majority of our Indirect retailers have been customers for over five years.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P47_S2	In fiscal 2012, we launched our products in the department store channel.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P47_S3	We believe that having an in-house sales force results in more consistent brand presentation and messaging, enhanced support for our Indirect retailers, and a more predictable, scalable, and cost-efficient business model.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P47_S4	As of February 2, 2013, our sales team consisted of 87 in-house, full-time sales consultants.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P47_S5	The compensation structure for our sales consultants consists of a combination of fixed pay and sales-based incentives.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P47_S6	In addition to acquiring new and growing existing accounts, our sales consultants serve as a support center for our Indirect retailers by assisting and educating them in areas such as merchandising and visual presentation, marketing of the brand, product selection, and inventory management.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P47_S7	Our sales consultants also participate in our semi-annual product introduction and education event for our Indirect retailers.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P47_S8	Our visual merchandising program provides our sales consultants with a framework to guide our Indirect retailers regarding optimal product placement and display that is intended to reinforce the message that our brand is distinct from those of our competitors.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	Manufacturing and Supply Chain Model Our manufacturing and supply chain model is designed to maximize flexibility in order to meet shifting demands in the market.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	Our model utilizes offshore raw material suppliers and a blend of offshore and domestic manufacturing.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P48_S2	We place a strong emphasis on continuous improvement and have employed lean manufacturing concepts.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P48_S3	Our broad-based, multi-country manufacturing and supply chain model is designed to achieve efficient, timely, and accurate order fulfillment while maintaining appropriate levels of inventory.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P48_S4	Our sourcing strategy is part of the larger cross-functional product development process.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P48_S5	The overall objective for our sourcing team is to build and sustain collaborative partnerships throughout our supply chain, with a focus on identifying appropriate countries and partners to manufacture our products.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P48_S6	The sourcing team leverages its expertise in negotiation, relationship management, and change management to maintain a strong global supply chain.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P48_S7	We strive to maintain the appropriate balance of inventory to enable us to provide a high level of service to our customers, including prompt and accurate delivery of our products.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P48_S8	We have an active sales and operations planning process that helps us balance the supply and demand issues that we encounter in our business, optimize our inventory levels, and anticipate inventory needs.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P48_S9	We have also integrated our planning, forecasting, and segmentation processes under one function called Inventory Planning and Deployment.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P48_S10	This integrated function along with the creation of a Merchant function, has allowed for further improvements to our inventory management processes.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	The majority of our products are cotton-based.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	Our other products are made primarily from specialty fabrics (including nylon and microfiber) and paper.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P49_S2	We source our materials from various suppliers in Asia, with the majority coming from China and South Korea.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P49_S3	Our global supply chain and purchasing teams work together with select suppliers enabling us to optimize the mix of cost, lead time, quality, and reliability within our global supply network.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P49_S4	All of our suppliers must comply with our quality standards, and we use only a limited number of pre-approved suppliers who have demonstrated a commitment to delivering the highest quality products.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P49_S5	In December 2008, we opened an office in Dongguan, China, which enables us to increase our control over the manufacturing and supply chain process and monitor compliance with our quality standards.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	A significant majority of our finished goods products are manufactured externally overseas.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	These products are made by a variety of global manufacturers located primarily in China.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	When determining the size of orders placed with our manufacturers, we take into account forward-looking demand, lead times for specific products, current inventory levels, and minimum order quantity requirements.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	Overseas production has resulted in substantial cost savings and a reduction of capital investment.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	With the oversight of our office in China and our independent contractors, we believe these financial benefits have been realized without sacrificing the level of quality inherent in our products or service to our customers.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S2	The remainder of our products are manufactured in the United States to provide flexibility in our supply chain.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S3	This production, almost all of which is internal to Vera Bradley, enables us to manufacture a finished product in two weeks.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S4	This capability allows us to manufacture finished product to respond quickly to shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S5	In fiscal 2013, approximately 7% of our units were produced in our domestic manufacturing facility.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S6	In 2007, we consolidated our warehousing and shipping functions into one, 217,320 square-foot distribution center, located in Roanoke, Indiana.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S7	In fiscal 2013, we completed a 200,000 square-foot expansion of the distribution facility.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S8	This highly automated, computerized facility allows Vera Bradley employees to receive information directly from the order-collection center and quickly identify the products and quantities necessary for a particular order.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S9	The recent expansion resulted in capacity gains in the areas of inbound receiving, inventory storage, order fulfillment, value-add processing and shipping.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S10	The facility s advanced technology enables us to more accurately process and pack orders, as well as track shipments and inventory.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S11	We believe that our systems for the processing and shipment of orders from our distribution center have enabled us to improve our overall customer service through enhanced order accuracy and reduced turnaround time.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S12	We strive to maintain the appropriate balance of inventory to enable us to provide a high level of service to our customers, including prompt and accurate delivery of our products.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S13	We have an active Inventory Planning and Deployment function that strives to balance the supply and demand issues that we encounter in our business, optimize our inventory levels, and anticipate inventory needs.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S14	Our products are shipped primarily via FedEx and common carriers to our stores, our Indirect retailers, and directly to our customers who purchase through our website.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S15	We believe we are positioned well to support the order fulfillment requirements of our growing business, including business generated through our website.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S16	We believe that high levels of automation and technology are essential to maintain our competitive position.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S17	We maintain computer hardware, systems applications, and networks to enhance and accelerate the design process, to support the sale and distribution of our products to our customers, and to improve the integration and efficiency of our operations.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S18	Our management information systems are designed to provide, among other things, comprehensive order processing, production, accounting, and management information for the product development, retail, sales, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, finance, and human resources functions of our business.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P52_S19	We use several systems, including MICROS-Retail, SAP, JDA, and SCALE, for our information technology requirements.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	Competition We face strong competition in each of the product lines and markets in which we compete.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	We believe that all of our products are in similar competitive positions with respect to the number of competitors they face and the level of competition within each product line.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P53_S2	Due to the number of different products we offer, it is not practicable for us to quantify the number of competitors we face.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P53_S3	Our products compete with other branded products within their product categories and with private label products sold by retailers.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers, and distributors of handbags, accessories, and other products for the limited space available for the display of such products to the consumer.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P54_S1	Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	In our Direct business, we compete against other independent retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, gift retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	The market for handbags, in particular, is highly competitive.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P55_S2	Our competitors include not only established companies that are expanding their production and marketing of handbags, but also frequent new entrants to the market.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P55_S3	We directly compete with wholesalers and direct sellers of branded handbags and accessories, such as Coach, Nine West, Liz Claiborne, Dooney Bourke, and Michael Kors.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P55_S4	In varying degrees, depending on the product category involved, we compete on the basis of design (aesthetic appeal), quality (construction), function, price point, distribution, and brand positioning.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P55_S5	We believe that our primary competitive advantages are consumer recognition of our brand, customer loyalty, product development expertise, and our widespread presence through our multi-channel distribution model.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P55_S6	Some of our competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources than we do.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P55_S7	Further, we may face new competitors and increased competition from existing competitors as we expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	Copyrights and Trademarks The development of each new pattern includes the design of an overall print, a complementary fabric backing, and coordinating trim materials.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	Once developed, we generally copyright each pattern, including the print, fabric backing, and coordinating trim.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P56_S2	We currently have in excess of 500 copyrights.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P56_S3	We also own all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing, and distribution of all of our products, both in the United States and in the other countries in which our products are principally sold.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P56_S4	We aggressively police our trademarks and copyrights and pursue infringers both domestically and internationally.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P56_S5	We also pursue counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally, as well as through external sources monitoring use in the market.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P56_S6	Our trademarks will remain in existence for as long as we continue to use and renew them on their expiration dates.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	Employees As of February 2, 2013, we had 2,438 employees.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P57_S1	Of the total, 1,319 were engaged in retail selling positions, 361 were engaged in manufacturing functions, 32 were engaged in product design, and 491 were engaged in corporate support and administrative functions.

1495320_13_ITEM1_P57_S4	We believe that our relations with our employees are good, and we have never encountered a significant work stoppage.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P57_S5	Many of our imported products are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs, or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the United States and other countries or impact the cost of such products.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P57_S6	To date, we have not been restricted by quotas in the operation of our business, and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of a majority of our products.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P57_S7	In addition, we are subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions, including U.S. retaliation against prohibited foreign practices, with respect to our product sourcing and international sales operations.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, and groundwater.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties, or the imposition of other liabilities.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect upon our earnings or financial position.
1495320_13_ITEM1_P59_S1	If we violate any laws or regulations, however, it could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance.

1495320_13_ITEM1_P68_S0	Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on our website, www.verabradley.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
1495320_13_ITEM1_P68_S1	No information contained on our website is intended to be included as part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	consider all of the information in this report, particularly the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in future periods.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The risks described below are not the only risks that we face.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in future periods.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	If we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategies or manage our growing business, our future operating results could suffer.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P0_S4	The success of our growth strategies, alone or collectively, will depend on various factors, including the appeal of our product designs, retail presentation to consumers, competitive conditions, and economic conditions.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P0_S5	If we are unsuccessful in implementing some or all of our strategies or initiatives, our future operating results could be adversely impacted.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Successful implementation of our strategies will require us to manage our growth.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P0_S7	To manage our growth effectively, we will need to continue to increase production while maintaining strict quality control.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P0_S8	We also will need to continue to improve and invest in our systems and processes to keep pace with planned increases in demand.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P0_S9	We could suffer a decline in sales if our products do not continue to meet our quality control standards or if we are unable to respond adequately to increases in customer demand for our products.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P0_S10	We are continuing to invest in our specialty retailers to support them in growing along with Vera Bradley.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P0_S11	This channel will continue to evolve over time as we balance the channel dynamics between the specialty retailers, department stores, our Direct stores, and e-commerce.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P0_S12	Additionally, our current growth strategy includes plans to expand internationally.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P0_S13	We currently plan to open additional retail space in Japan.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P0_S14	We do not yet have significant experience operating in Japan, and we face established competitors.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P0_S15	Furthermore, Japan has different operational characteristics, including but not limited to employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, and local reporting or legal requirements.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P0_S16	In addition, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in Japan, and as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P0_S17	If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, our financial results could be adversely affected.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P0_S18	Changes in general economic conditions, and their impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In recent years, consumer confidence and consumer spending deteriorated significantly, influenced by fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, changing fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, higher levels of unemployment and consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty, and this could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	In the event of another significant economic downturn, we could experience lower than expected net revenues, which could force us to delay or slow the implementation of our growth strategies and adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our inability to predict and respond in a timely manner to changes in consumer demand could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our success depends on our ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies consumer demand in a timely manner.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to develop appealing patterns and styles or meet changing consumer demands in the future.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	If we misjudge the market for our products, we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Merchandise misjudgments could adversely impact our net revenues and results of operations.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P2_S6	We may not be able to successfully open and operate new stores as planned, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Our continued growth will depend on our ability to successfully open and operate new stores.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P2_S8	We plan to open approximately 20 new stores during each of the next five fiscal years.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P2_S9	Our ability to successfully open and operate new stores depends on many factors, including our ability to:
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	successfully integrate new stores into our existing operations and information technology systems.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The success of new store openings may also be affected by our ability to initiate marketing efforts in advance of opening our first store in a particular region.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Additionally, we will encounter pre-operating costs and we may encounter initial losses while new stores commence operations, which could strain our resources and adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our business depends on a strong brand.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	If we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand, then we may be unable to sell our products, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We believe that the brand image that we have developed has contributed significantly to the success of our business.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We also believe that maintaining and enhancing the Vera Bradley brand is critical to maintaining and expanding our customer base.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as product design, store operations, and community relations.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P4_S5	If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brand image, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Our results of operations could suffer if we lose key management or design associates or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P4_S7	Our performance depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and product development teams.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P4_S8	These executives and design associates have substantial experience in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P4_S9	We do not have employment agreements with any of our key executives or design associates.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P4_S10	The unexpected loss of services of certain of these individuals could have adverse impacts on our business and results of operations.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P4_S11	As our business grows and we open new stores, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees and develop, train, and manage an increasing number of management-level, sales, and other employees.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P4_S12	Competition for qualified employees is intense.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P4_S13	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain employees as needed in the future.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our results of operations are subject to quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including, among other things:
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	the timing of new pattern releases and new product introductions.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	As a result of these quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our sales and operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Any quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	This could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	A data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, expose us to litigation risk and adversely affect our business.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P6_S5	We are dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet, for a significant portion of our Direct store sales, including our e-commerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P6_S6	We are also responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our e-commerce websites and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P6_S7	As part of our normal course of business, we often collect, retain, and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information, over public networks.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	There is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Despite the security measures we currently have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Any electronic or physical security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, including penetration of our network security, whether by us or by a third-party, could disrupt our business, severely damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, expose us to risks of litigation and liability and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Since we do not control third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future, any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility, reduce our e-commerce net sales, impair our ability to attract website visitors and reduce our ability to attract and retain customers.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We may also incur significant costs in complying with the various applicable state, federal and foreign laws regarding unauthorized disclosure of personal information.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P7_S6	We are dependent on our computer systems to record and process transactions and manage and operate our business, including in designing, marketing, manufacturing, importing, tracking and distributing our products, processing payments, and accounting for and reporting results.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	system to facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders, the movement of goods through distribution channels, and the collection of information for planning and forecasting.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In addition, we have e-commerce and other Internet websites in the U.S. and Japan.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Given the complexity of our business and the significant number of transactions that we engage in on an annual basis, it is imperative that we maintain constant operation of our computer hardware and software systems.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from, among other things, security breaches, computer viruses or power outages.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Any material disruptions in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Our inability to sustain levels of comparable-store sales could cause our stock price to decline.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	We may not be able to sustain the levels of comparable-store sales that we have experienced in the recent past.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P9_S5	If our future comparable-store sales decline or fail to meet market expectations, then the price of our common stock could decline.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Also, the aggregate results of operations of our stores have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Numerous factors influence comparable-store sales, including fashion trends, competition, national and regional economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, inventory shrinkage, marketing programs, changes in consumer shopping trends towards on-line shopping, and weather conditions.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In addition, many companies with retail operations have been unable to sustain high levels of comparable-store sales during and after periods of substantial expansion.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	These factors may cause our comparable-store sales results to be lower in the future than in recent periods or lower than expectations, either of which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We do not own any real estate other than our distribution facility.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We lease our corporate headquarters, our other offices, and all of our store locations.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We typically occupy our stores under operating leases with terms of ten years.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P11_S4	We have been able to negotiate favorable rental rates in recent years due in part to the state of the economy and high vacancy rates within some shopping centers, but there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to negotiate such favorable terms.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Some of our leases have early cancellation clauses, which permit the lease to be terminated by us or the landlord if certain sales levels are not met in specific periods or if the shopping center does not meet specified occupancy standards.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P11_S6	In addition to requiring future minimum lease payments, some of our store leases provide for the payment of common area maintenance charges, real property insurance, and real estate taxes.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Many of our lease agreements have escalating rent provisions over the initial term and any extensions.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P11_S8	As we expand our store base, our lease expense and our cash outlays for rent under lease agreements will increase.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P11_S9	Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including:
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	limiting our ability to obtain additional financing.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Any of these consequences could place us at a disadvantage with respect to our competitors.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We depend on cash flow from operating activities to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses and needs, we may not be able to service our lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would harm our business.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Additional sites that we lease may be subject to long-term non-cancelable leases if we are unable to negotiate our current standard lease terms.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, including paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Moreover, even if a lease has an early cancellation clause, we may not satisfy the contractual requirements for early cancellation under the lease.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Our inability to enter new leases or renew existing leases on acceptable terms or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that we close would, in any such case, affect us adversely.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We operate in a competitive market.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Our competitors might develop products more popular with consumers than our products.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The market for handbags, accessories, and travel and leisure items is competitive.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	establishing and maintaining good working relationships with our Indirect retailers.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In our Indirect business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers, and distributors of handbags, accessories, and other products for the limited space available for the display of such products to the consumer.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In our Direct business, we compete against other gift and specialty retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P16_S4	We rely on various contract manufacturers to produce a significant majority of our products and generally do not have long-term contracts with our manufacturers.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Disruptions in our contract manufacturers systems, losses of manufacturing certifications, or other actions by these manufacturers could increase our cost of sales, adversely affect our net revenues, and injure our reputation and customer relationships, thereby harming our business.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Our various contract manufacturers produce a significant majority of our products.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P16_S7	We generally do not enter into long-term formal written agreements with our manufacturers and instead transact business with each of them on an order-by-order basis.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P16_S8	In the event of a disruption in our contract manufacturers systems, we may be unable to locate alternative manufacturers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P16_S9	Identifying a suitable manufacturer is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with the prospective manufacturer s quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability, and labor practices.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P16_S10	Any delay, interruption, or increased cost in the manufactured products that might occur for any reason, such as the lack of long-term contracts or regulatory requirements and the loss of certifications, power interruptions, fires, hurricanes, war, or threats of terrorism, could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products, adversely affect our net revenues, increase our cost of sales, and hurt our results of operations.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P16_S11	In addition, manufacturing disruption could injure our reputation and customer relationships, thereby harming our business.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We rely on various suppliers to supply a significant majority of our raw materials.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Disruption in the supply of raw materials could increase our cost of goods sold and adversely affect our net revenues.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We generally do not enter into long-term formal written agreements with our suppliers and typically transact business with each of them on an order-by-order basis.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from our current sources or, in the event of a disruption, that we would be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We rely on a single distribution facility for all of the products we sell.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Disruption to that facility could adversely impact our results of operations, and expansion of that facility could have unpredictable adverse effects.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our distribution operations are currently concentrated in a single, company-owned distribution center in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Any significant disruption in the operation of the facility due to natural disaster or severe weather, or events such as fire, accidents, power outages, system failures, or other unforeseen causes, could devalue or damage a significant portion of our inventory and could adversely affect our product distribution and sales until such time as we could secure an alternative facility.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P19_S4	If we encounter difficulties with our distribution facility or other problems or disasters arise, we cannot ensure that critical systems and operations will be restored in a timely manner or at all, and this would have a material adverse effect on our business.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P19_S5	In addition, our growth could require us to further expand our current facility, which could affect us adversely in ways that we cannot predict.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P19_S6	The cost of raw materials could increase our cost of sales and cause our results of operations to suffer.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Fluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of fabrics or other raw materials used to manufacture our products, as well as the price for labor, marketing, and transportation, could have adverse impacts on our cost of sales and our ability to meet our customers demands.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P19_S8	In particular, fluctuations in the price of cotton, our primary raw material, could have an adverse impact on our cost of sales.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P19_S9	In addition, because a key component of our products is petroleum-based, the cost of oil affects the cost of our products.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P19_S10	Upward movement in the price of oil in the global oil markets would also likely result in rising fuel and freight prices, which could increase our shipping costs.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P19_S11	In the future, we may not be able to pass all or a portion of higher costs on to our customers.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P19_S12	Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing and manufacturing activities.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P19_S13	We source our fabrics primarily from manufacturers in China and South Korea and outsource the production of a significant majority of our products to companies in Asia.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P19_S14	We are subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing and manufacturing, including, but not limited to:
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	natural disasters, acts of war and terrorism, changing macroeconomic trends, and other external factors over which we have no control.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Additionally, we do not have complete oversight over our contract manufacturers.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	accepted as ethical in the United States or in other markets in which we may in the future do business, could also draw negative publicity for us and our brand, diminishing the value of our brand and reducing demand for our products.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our ability to source our products at favorable prices, or at all, could be harmed, with adverse effects on our results of operations, if new trade restrictions are imposed or if existing trade restrictions become more burdensome.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	A significant majority of our products are currently manufactured for us in Asia.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The United States and the countries in which our products are produced have imposed and may impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or regulations or may adversely adjust prevailing quotas, duties, or tariffs.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Countries impose, modify, and remove tariffs and other trade restrictions in response to a diverse array of factors, including global and national economic and political conditions, which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other trade restrictions.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Trade restrictions, which include embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us or could require us to modify supply chain organization or other current business practices, any of which could harm our results of operations.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	We may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Currently, none of our employees is represented by a union.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Nevertheless, our employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to organize or affiliate with a union.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P23_S6	If some or all of our workforce were to become unionized, our business would be exposed to work stoppages and slowdowns as a unionized business.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P23_S7	If, in addition, the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly more favorable to union workers than our current pay-and-benefits arrangements, our costs would increase and our results of operations would suffer.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P23_S8	We rely on independent transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We currently rely on independent transportation service providers for substantially all of our product shipments.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our utilization of these delivery services, or those of any other shipping companies that we may elect to use, is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, and employee strikes and inclement weather, which may impact the shipping company s ability to provide delivery services sufficient to meet our shipping needs.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If for any reason we were to change shipping companies, we could face logistical difficulties that might adversely affect deliveries, and we would incur costs and expend resources in the course of making the change.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Moreover, we might not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from the service providers that we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P24_S4	We also would face shipping and distribution risks and uncertainties associated with any expansion of our distribution facility and related systems.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P24_S5	We plan to use cash provided by operating activities to fund our expanding business and execute our growth strategies and may require additional capital, which may not be available to us.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Our business relies on cash provided by operating activities as our primary source of liquidity.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P24_S7	To support our growing business and execute our growth strategies, we will need significant amounts of cash from that source.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P24_S8	If our business does not generate cash flow from operating activities sufficient to fund these activities, and if sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from our existing revolving credit facility, we will need to seek additional capital, through debt or equity financings, to fund our growth.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P24_S9	If new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, then we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would inhibit our growth and could harm our business.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We face various risks as an e-commerce retailer.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Business risks relating to e-commerce sales include the need to keep pace with rapid technological change, internet security risks, risks of system failure or inadequacy, governmental regulation, and taxation.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We have contracted with several different companies to maintain and operate various aspects of our e-commerce business and are reliant on them and their ability to perform their tasks, as well as their operational, privacy, and security procedures and controls as they affect our business.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P25_S3	If the independent contractors on which we rely fail to perform their tasks, we could incur liability or suffer damages to our reputation, or both.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Our copyrights, trademarks and other proprietary rights could conflict with the rights of others, and we may be inhibited from selling some of our products.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P25_S5	If we are unable to protect our copyrights and other proprietary rights, others may sell imitation brand products.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P25_S6	We believe that our registered copyrights, registered and common law trademarks, and other proprietary rights have significant value and are critical to our ability to create and sustain demand for our products.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P25_S7	Although we have not been inhibited from selling our products in connection with intellectual property disputes, we cannot assure you that obstacles will not arise as we expand our product line and extend our brand as well as the geographic scope of our sales and marketing.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P25_S8	We also cannot assure you that the actions taken by us to establish and protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products or infringement of our rights by others.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P25_S9	The legal regimes of some foreign countries, particularly China, may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by others in these countries.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P25_S10	The loss of copyrights, trademarks, and other proprietary rights could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P25_S11	Any litigation regarding our proprietary rights could be time consuming and costly.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P25_S12	Prior to the completion of the Reorganization, we were treated as an S Corporation under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code, and claims of taxing authorities related to our prior status as an S Corporation could harm us.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P25_S13	Upon the completion of the Reorganization in fiscal 2011, our S Corporation status terminated automatically and we became subject to increased federal and state income taxes.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P25_S14	If the unaudited, open tax years in which we were an S Corporation are audited by the Internal Revenue Service, and we are determined not to have qualified for, or to have violated, our S Corporation status, we will be obligated to pay back taxes, interest, and penalties, and we do not have the right to reclaim tax distributions we have made to our shareholders during those periods.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P25_S15	These amounts could include taxes on all of our taxable income while we were an S Corporation.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P25_S16	Any such claims could result in additional costs to us and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P25_S17	Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results and stock price.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are subject to income taxes in many U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which includes reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Further, possible changes in federal, state, local, and non-U.S. tax laws bearing upon our revenues, income, property, or other aspects of our operations or business would, if enacted, affect our results of operations in ways and to a degree that we cannot currently predict.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Additional indebtedness incurred in connection with the Reorganization may decrease business flexibility and increase borrowing costs.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	On October 4, 2010, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that increased our available credit from $75 million to $125 million.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	outstanding borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement to fund a final S Corporation distribution to our then-shareholders.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	As of February 2, 2013, we had outstanding borrowings of $15.0 million under our amended and restated credit agreement, compared to $25.0 million outstanding under our former credit facility as of January 28, 2012.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Our indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of:
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to companies that have less debt.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our Indirect business could suffer as a result of bankruptcies or operational or financial difficulties of our Indirect retailers.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We do not enter into long-term agreements with any of our Indirect retailers.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers for each of our lines every season.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P31_S4	A decision by a significant number of Indirect retailers, whether motivated by competitive conditions, operational or financial difficulties, reduced access to capital, or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or to change their manner of doing business with us could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P31_S5	Although we recommend retail sale prices for our products to our Indirect retailers, we do not provide dealer allowances or other economic incentives to support those prices.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Possible promotional pricing or discounting by Indirect retailers in response to softening retail demand could have a negative effect on our brand image and prestige, which might be difficult to counteract as the economy improves.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We sell our Indirect merchandise primarily to specialty retail stores across the United States and extend trade credit based on an evaluation of each Indirect retailer s financial condition, usually without requiring collateral.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Perceived financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Pending the resolution of a relationship with a financially troubled Indirect retailer, we might assume credit risk that we would otherwise avoid relating to our receivables from that customer.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Inability to collect on accounts receivable from our Indirect retailers would adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	There are claims made against us from time to time that can result in litigation or regulatory proceedings, which could distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability or damage to our brand image.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P33_S4	As a growing company with expanding operations, we increasingly face the risk of litigation and other claims against us.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Litigation and other claims may arise in the ordinary course of our business and include employee claims, custom and duty claims, commercial disputes, intellectual property issues, product-oriented allegations, and slip and fall claims.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P33_S6	Often these cases raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P33_S7	Litigation and other claims against us could result in unexpected expenses and liability, as well as materially adversely affect our operations and our reputation.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P33_S8	Health care reform could adversely affect the Company s business.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P33_S9	In 2010, Congress enacted comprehensive health care reform legislation which, among other things, includes guaranteed coverage requirements, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits, restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded, and imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Possible adverse effects of the health reform legislation include increased costs, exposure to expanded liability and requirements for the Company to revise ways in which it conducts business.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Risks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock Our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell shares at or above the price at which you purchase them.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	These and other factors may result in a lower market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	As a result, our common stock may trade at prices significantly below the offering price.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	In addition, the stock markets, including The Nasdaq Global Select Market, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many retail companies.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P35_S3	In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P35_S4	If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Because a limited number of shareholders control a large percentage of the voting power of our common stock, investors may have limited ability to determine the outcome of shareholder votes.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Michael Ray, Robert Hall, Barbara Bradley Baekgaard, Joan Hall (Mr. Hall s wife and Ms. Bradley Baekgaard s daughter), Patricia R. Miller and P. Michael Miller, directly or indirectly, beneficially own and have the ability to exercise voting control over, in the aggregate, 43.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P36_S2	As a result, these shareholders are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, any amendments to our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and significant corporate transactions.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P36_S3	This concentrated ownership of outstanding common stock may limit your ability to influence corporate matters, and the interests of these shareholders may not coincide with our interests or your interests.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P36_S4	As a result, we may take actions that you do not believe to be in our interests or your interests and that could depress our stock price.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P36_S5	In addition, this significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock should investors perceive disadvantages in owning shares of common stock in a company that has such concentrated ownership.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	From time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management s estimates as of the date of release.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed, but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	The principal reason that we release these data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P39_S3	We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data are forecast.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P40_S4	In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Indiana law may discourage or prevent a change in control, even if a sale of the company would be beneficial to our shareholders, which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by shareholders to replace or remove our current management.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control, discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock, harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	requiring advance notice for raising business matters or nominating directors at shareholders meetings.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P42_S1	As permitted by our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, our board of directors also has the ability, should they so determine, to adopt a shareholder rights agreement, sometimes called a poison pill, providing for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common stock.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P42_S2	In the event of a takeover attempt, this preferred stock would give rights to holders of common stock (other than the potential acquirer) to buy additional shares of common stock at a discount, leading to the dilution of the potential acquirer s stake.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The adoption of a poison pill, or the board s ability to do so, can have negative effects such as those described above.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	As an Indiana corporation, we are governed by the Indiana Business Corporation Law (as amended from time to time, the IBCL ).
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Under specified circumstances, certain provisions of the IBCL related to control share acquisitions, business combinations and constituent interests may delay, prevent or make more difficult unsolicited acquisitions or changes of control of us.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P44_S2	These provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our management.
1495320_13_ITEM1A_P44_S3	It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that shareholders might deem to be in their best interest.
1495320_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	forth the location, use, and size of our manufacturing, distribution, and corporate facilities as of February 2, 2013.
1495320_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	The leases on the leased properties expire at various times through 2015, subject to renewal options.
1495320_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	This property is owned by Milburn, LLC, a leasing company in which Barbara Bradley Baekgaard owns a 50% interest and Patricia R. Miller and P. Michael Miller each own a 25% interest.
1495320_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, of this report for additional information regarding this property.
1495320_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	In March 2011, we entered into a lease with Great Dane Realty, LLC, a company owned by Barbara Bradley Baekgaard.
1495320_13_ITEM2_P2_S1	See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, of this report for additional information regarding this property.
1495320_13_ITEM2_P3_S0	As of February 2, 2013, we also leased 90 store locations in the United States, including 14 store locations opened or to be opened in fiscal 2014.
1495320_13_ITEM2_P3_S1	See below for more information regarding the locations of our open stores as of February 2, 2013.
1495320_13_ITEM2_P4_S0	We consider these properties to be in good condition generally and believe that our facilities are adequate for our operations and provide sufficient capacity to meet our anticipated requirements.
1495320_13_ITEM2_P4_S1	The properties in the above table are used by both the Direct segment and Indirect segment, excluding the two showrooms which are used exclusively by the Indirect segment.
1495320_13_ITEM2_P5_S0	Our full-price stores are located primarily in high-traffic regional malls, lifestyle centers, and mixed-use shopping centers across the United States.
1495320_13_ITEM2_P5_S1	The following table shows the number of full-price and outlet stores we operated in each state as of February 2, 2013:
1495320_13_ITEM2_P6_S0	We lease all of our stores.
1495320_13_ITEM2_P6_S1	Initial lease terms for our stores are approximately 10 years in duration without renewal options.
1495320_13_ITEM2_P6_S2	The leases generally provide for a fixed minimum rental plus contingent rent, which is determined as a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels.
1495320_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	from time to time, as a plaintiff or a defendant, in various routine legal proceedings incident to the ordinary course of our business.
1495320_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the ordinary course, we are involved in the policing of our intellectual property rights.
1495320_13_ITEM3_P0_S2	As part of our policing program, from time to time we file lawsuits in the United States and abroad, alleging acts of trademark counterfeiting, trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and ancillary and pendent state and foreign law claims.
1495320_13_ITEM3_P0_S3	These actions often result in seizure of counterfeit merchandise and negotiated settlements with defendants.
1495320_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	Defendants sometimes raise as affirmative defenses, or as counterclaims, the purported invalidity or unenforceability of our proprietary rights.
1495320_13_ITEM3_P1_S1	We believe that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
1495320_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol VRA since our initial public offering on October 21, 2010.
1495320_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices of our common stock, as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market, for each quarterly period in our two most recent fiscal years:
1495320_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of March 22, 2013, we had approximately 29 registered shareholders of record.
1495320_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	The number of shareholders of record is based upon the actual number of shareholders registered at such date and does not include holders of shares in street names or persons, partnerships, associations, corporations, or other entities identified in security position listings maintained by depositories.
1495320_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	Dividends Our common stock began trading on October 21, 2010, following our initial public offering.
1495320_13_ITEM5_P2_S1	Since that time, we have not declared any cash dividends, and we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1495320_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	Prior to our initial public offering, as an S Corporation, we distributed annually to our shareholders amounts sufficient to cover their tax liabilities, due to the income that flowed through the shareholders tax returns.
1495320_13_ITEM5_P3_S1	Additional amounts were distributed from time to time to our shareholders at the discretion of the board of directors.
1495320_13_ITEM5_P3_S2	During fiscal 2011, we paid distributions of $132.8 million to our shareholders, which included a final distribution (resulting from the termination of our S Corporation status) of 100% of our undistributed taxable income from the date of our formation through October 2, 2010.
1495320_13_ITEM5_P3_S3	Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans The following table sets forth information regarding equity securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans as of February 2, 2013:
1495320_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	(1) Approved before our initial public offering.
1495320_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	Stock Performance Graph The graph set forth below compares the cumulative shareholder return on our common stock between October 21, 2010 (the date of our initial public offering), and January 28, 2012, to the cumulative return of (i) the S P 500 Index and (ii) the S P 500 Apparel, Accessories, and Luxury Goods Index over the same period.
1495320_13_ITEM5_P5_S1	This graph assumes an initial investment of $100 on October 21, 2010, in our common stock, the S P 500 Index, and the S P 500 Apparel, Accessories, and Luxury Goods Index and assumes the reinvestment of dividends, if any.
1495320_13_ITEM5_P5_S2	The graph also assumes that the initial price of our common stock on October 21, 2010, was the initial public offering price of $16.00 per share and that the initial prices of the S P 500 Index and the S P 500 Apparel, Accessories, and Luxury Goods Index on October 21, 2010, were the closing prices on the previous trading day.
1495320_13_ITEM5_P6_S0	The comparisons shown in the graph below are based on historical data.
1495320_13_ITEM5_P7_S0	We caution that the stock price performance presented in the graph below is not necessarily indicative of, or is it intended to forecast, the potential future performance of our common stock.

1495320_13_ITEM6_P2_S0	(2) On October 3, 2010, we converted from an S Corporation to a C Corporation for income-tax purposes.
1495320_13_ITEM6_P2_S1	For additional information, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
1495320_13_ITEM6_P3_S0	(3) On October 18, 2010, we effectuated a 35.437-for-1 stock split of all outstanding shares of our common stock.

1495320_13_ITEM6_P4_S0	(4) Includes full-price and outlet stores.
1495320_13_ITEM6_P4_S1	Our first full-price store opened in September 2007 and our first outlet store opened in November 2009.
1495320_13_ITEM6_P5_S0	(5) Comparable-store sales are the net revenues of our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the period.

1495320_13_ITEM7_P0_S5	Executive summary Below is a summary of our strategic progress and financial highlights:
1495320_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	We successfully opened 20 new full-price and outlet stores during the year in both current and underpenetrated markets.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	We continued to build on our positive momentum at Dillard s and are now in all 284 locations, as of the launch of the Spring assortment in the fourth quarter.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Nearly 62 million people visited VeraBradley.com, a 45% increase over the prior year.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	We consistently rank among the top in number of annual website visits compared to our most closely related peer companies.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	We adjusted our release cadence to better align with when our customer shops.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	In November, we completed the expansion of our distribution center, doubling the capacity to 400,000 square feet to better serve our customer base.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	We contributed approximately $1 million to the Vera Bradley Foundation supporting breast cancer research.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	How We Assess the Performance of Our Business In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Net Revenues Net revenues reflect revenues from the sale of our merchandise and from distribution and shipping and handling fees, less returns and discounts.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	Revenues for the Direct segment reflect sales through our full-price and outlet stores, department store locations in Japan, our websites, verabradley.com and verabradley.co.jp, and our annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	Revenues for the Indirect segment reflect sales to Indirect specialty retailers and department stores.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P8_S3	Comparable-Store Sales Comparable-store sales are calculated based upon our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the reporting period.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P8_S4	Remodeled stores are included in comparable-store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales differently than we do.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	As a result, data in this report regarding our comparable-store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other companies.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Non-comparable store sales include sales from stores not included in comparable-store sales.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	Comparable store sales do not include e-commerce sales.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Measuring the change in year-over-year comparable-store sales allows us to evaluate how our store base is performing.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	Various factors affect our comparable-store sales, including:
1495320_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	The timing and success of promotional and advertising efforts.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	Gross Profit Gross profit is equal to our net revenues less our cost of sales.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Cost of sales includes the direct cost of purchased and manufactured merchandise, distribution center costs, operations overhead, duty, and all inbound freight costs incurred.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	The components of our reported cost of sales may not be comparable to those of other retail and wholesale companies.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Gross profit can be impacted by changes in volume, fluctuations in sales price, operational efficiencies, such as leveraging of fixed costs, promotional activities, such as free shipping, and commodity prices such as cotton, and labor in Asia.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (SG A) SG A expenses include selling; advertising, marketing, and product development; and administrative.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	Selling expenses include Direct business expenses such as store expenses, employee compensation, and store occupancy and supply costs, as well as Indirect business expenses consisting primarily of employee compensation and other expenses associated with sales to Indirect retailers.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P15_S2	Advertising, marketing, and product development expenses include employee compensation, media costs, creative production expenses, marketing agency fees, new product design costs, public relations expenses, and market research expenses.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P15_S3	A portion of our advertising expenses may be reimbursed by Indirect retailers, and such amount is classified as other income.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P15_S4	Administrative expenses include employee compensation for corporate functions, corporate headquarters occupancy costs, consulting and software expenses, and charitable donations.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P15_S5	Other Income We support many of our Indirect retailers marketing efforts by distributing certain catalogs and promotional mailers to current and prospective customers.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P15_S6	Our Indirect retailers reimburse us for a portion of the cost to produce these materials.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P15_S7	Reimbursement received is recorded as other income.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P15_S8	The related cost to design, produce, and distribute the catalogs and mailers is recorded as SG A expense.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P15_S9	Other income also includes proceeds from the sales of tickets to our annual outlet sale and the gain on the sale of certain life insurance policies.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P15_S10	Operating Income Operating income equals gross profit less SG A expenses plus other income.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P15_S11	Operating income excludes interest income, interest expense, and income taxes.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Income Taxes Prior to October 3, 2010, we were taxed as an S Corporation for federal income tax purposes under Section 1362 of the Internal Revenue Code, and therefore were not subject to federal and state income taxes (subject to exception in a limited number of state and local jurisdictions that do not recognize the S Corporation status).
1495320_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	On October 3, 2010, our S Corporation status automatically terminated and we became subject to corporate-level federal and state income taxes at prevailing corporate rates.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	The following tables summarize key components of our consolidated results of operations for the last three fiscal years, both in dollars and as a percentage of our net revenues.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	The Company utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	As such, fiscal year 2013 ended on February 2, 2013 and reflected a 53-week period; fiscal years 2012 and 2011 ended on January 28, 2012, and January 29, 2011, respectively and reflected 52-week periods.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	The inclusion of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2013 resulted in incremental net revenues of approximately $4.9 million and approximately $0.02 per diluted share.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P17_S4	The following tables present net revenues by operating segment, both in dollars and as a percentage of our net revenues, and full-price and outlet store data for the last three fiscal years:
1495320_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	(2) Includes only our full-price and outlet stores.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	Our first full-price store opened in September 2007 and our first outlet store opened in November 2009.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	(3) Comparable-store sales are the net revenues of our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the period.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	Increase or decrease is reported as a percentage change of the comparable-store sales for the same period in the prior fiscal year.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	Remodeled stores are included in comparable-store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	Comparable store sales do not include e-commerce sales.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P19_S4	Calculation excludes sales for the 53 rd week in fiscal 2013.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	Average net revenues per gross square foot are calculated by dividing total net revenues for our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the period by total gross square footage for those stores.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Net Revenues For fiscal 2013, net revenues increased $80.3 million, or 17.4%, to $541.1 million, from $460.8 million for fiscal 2012, primarily due to increased volume and an additional 7 days included in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, which added net revenues of $4.9 million.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	For fiscal 2013, net revenues increased $67.3 million, or 29.9%, to $292.6 million, from $225.3 million for fiscal 2012.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P20_S3	This growth resulted primarily from a $44.8 million increase in revenues related to additional full-price and outlet stores; a comparable-store sales increase of $3.4 million, or 3.4%, primarily driven by the improved performance of the product assortment and various in-store events to drive traffic; and an $18.9 million increase in e-commerce revenues due to the continued growth in website traffic.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P20_S4	The number of our stores grew from 56 at the end of fiscal 2012 to 76 at the end of fiscal 2013.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P20_S5	For fiscal 2013, net revenues increased $13.0 million, or 5.5%, to $248.6 million, from $235.6 million for fiscal 2012, due to growth in the number of department store locations and increased sales volume to our specialty retailers.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P20_S6	Gross Profit For fiscal 2013, gross profit increased $50.7 million, or 19.7%, to $308.3 million, from $257.6 million for fiscal 2012.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P20_S7	As a percentage of net revenues, gross profit increased to 57.0% for fiscal 2013, from 55.9% for fiscal 2012.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P20_S8	The increase in gross margin was due primarily to operational efficiencies, lower freight expense, positive channel mix, and lower input costs.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P20_S9	For fiscal 2013, SG A expenses increased $35.0 million, or 20.6%, to $204.4 million, from $169.4 million for fiscal 2012.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P20_S10	As a percentage of net revenues, SG A expenses were 37.8% and 36.8% for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P20_S11	The increase as a percentage of net revenues in SG A expenses was due primarily to increased headcount expenses and increased store operating expenses.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Other Income For fiscal 2013, other income decreased $1.7 million, or 21.3%, to $6.3 million, from $8.0 million for fiscal 2012.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	The decrease in other income was in line with a decrease in associated advertising costs related to mailers for our specialty retailers.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	Operating Income For fiscal 2013, operating income increased $14.0 million, or 14.5%, to $110.1 million, from $96.2 million for fiscal 2012.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	As a percentage of net revenues, operating income was 20.4% and 20.9% for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively (in thousands).
1495320_13_ITEM7_P21_S4	For fiscal 2013, operating income increased $17.0 million, or 24.9%.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P21_S5	As a percentage of Direct segment net revenues, operating income in the Direct segment was 29.1% and 30.2% for fiscals 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P21_S6	This decrease as a percentage of net revenues in the Direct segment was primarily due to increased store operating expense.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P21_S7	For fiscal 2013, operating income increased $8.0 million, or 8.6%.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P21_S8	As a percentage of Indirect segment net revenues, operating income in the Indirect segment was 40.7% and 39.5% for fiscals 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P21_S9	This increase as a percentage of net revenues in the Indirect segment resulted primarily due to leverage of the relatively fixed SG A expenses, against sales growth.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P21_S10	For fiscal 2013, unallocated expenses increased $11.0 million, or 16.9%, primarily as a result of increased corporate personnel and marketing costs.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P21_S11	For fiscal 2013, net interest expense decreased $0.5 million, or 40.8%, to $0.7 million, from $1.1 million in fiscal 2012.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P21_S12	The decrease was due to lower average borrowing levels in fiscal 2013.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	For fiscal 2013, we recorded income tax expense of $40.6 million at an effective tax rate of 37.1%, compared to 39.0% for fiscal year 2012.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	The effective tax rate reduction was primarily related to state income tax credits associated with the completion of our distribution center expansion and discrete items recorded primarily during the third quarter.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	The impact of these items on the effective tax rate was approximately 1.2% for the fiscal year.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P22_S3	During fiscal 2012, there were other permanent items that caused a higher rate which did not recur during fiscal 2013 causing the rate to decrease approximately 0.5% compared to the prior year.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P22_S4	The effective tax rate also reflects a loss for the Japanese operations for which a tax benefit was not recognized.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Net Revenues For fiscal 2012, net revenues increased $94.8 million, or 26.0%, to $460.8 million, from $366.1 million for fiscal 2011, primarily due to increased volume.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	For fiscal 2012, net revenues increased $74.2 million, or 49.1%, to $225.3 million, from $151.1 million for fiscal 2011.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	This growth resulted from a $28.6 million increase in e-commerce revenues due primarily to greater traffic resulting from marketing initiatives, a $39.4 million increase in non-comparable store sales, and a $6.2 million, or 10.9%, increase in comparable-store sales.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	The number of our stores grew from 39 at the end of fiscal 2011 to 56 at the end of fiscal 2012.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P23_S4	For fiscal 2012, net revenues increased $20.6 million, or 9.6%, to $235.6 million, from $214.9 million for fiscal 2011, due to increased sales volume to our specialty retailers, driven by strong demand for carryover patterns, fall product assortment, and the launch of rolling luggage.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P23_S5	Gross Profit For fiscal 2012, gross profit increased $48.5 million, or 23.2%, to $257.6 million, from $209.1 million for fiscal 2011.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P23_S6	As a percentage of net revenues, gross profit decreased to 55.9% for fiscal 2012, from 57.1% for fiscal 2011.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P23_S7	The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to higher cotton and labor costs and higher sales of certain retired inventory sold at lower than normal gross margins, partially offset by an overall revenue mix shift toward higher margin, retail-store sales and e-commerce.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P23_S8	For fiscal 2012, SG A expenses increased $6.3 million, or 3.9%, to $169.4 million, from $163.1 million for fiscal 2011.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P23_S9	As a percentage of net revenues, SG A expenses were 36.8% and 44.5% for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, respectively.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P23_S10	The decrease as a percentage of net revenues in SG A expenses was due primarily to $21.9 million of compensation expense related to restricted-stock awards and a decline in professional fees related to our transition from a private to a public company both of which were included in fiscal 2011.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P23_S11	In addition, SG A expenses declined as a percentage of net revenues due to leverage of our relatively fixed cost structure of the Indirect segment, partially offset by our investment into the Japanese market.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P23_S12	Other Income For fiscal 2012, other income increased $0.8 million, or 10.4%, to $8.0 million, from $7.2 million for fiscal 2011, due primarily to increased reimbursement of our advertising expenses by our specialty retailers.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P23_S13	The increase was due in part to sales of tickets to our annual outlet sale and the gain on the sale of certain life insurance policies.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	Operating Income For fiscal 2012, operating income increased $42.9 million, or 80.4%, to $96.2 million, from $53.3 million for fiscal 2011.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	As a percentage of net revenues, operating income was 20.9% and 14.6% for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, respectively.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	This increase as a percentage of net revenues was due primarily to the $21.9 million of compensation expense related to restricted-stock awards in the prior year.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P24_S3	Excluding this compensation expense in the prior year, operating income as a percentage of sales increased due to sales-driven leverage of SG A on our high growth of net revenues, partially offset by higher cotton and labor prices and our investment into the Japanese market (in thousands):
1495320_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	For fiscal 2012, operating income increased $21.7 million, or 46.6%, due to an increase in gross profit, offset in part by increased selling expenses related to store operational costs and costs associated with our market entry into Japan.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	For fiscal 2012, operating income increased $1.4 million, or 1.5%, primarily from an increase in revenue and sales-driven leverage of SG A, offset in part by a decline in gross margin, as previously discussed.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	For fiscal 2012, unallocated expenses decreased $19.8 million, or 23.4%, primarily as a result of stock-based compensation expense and bonuses paid to recipients of restricted-stock awards in the prior-year period.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P25_S3	Interest Expense, Net For the fiscal year ended January 28, 2012, net interest expense decreased $0.5 million, or 29.5%, to $1.1 million, from $1.6 million in the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P25_S4	The decrease of $0.5 million was due primarily to a write off in the same period of the prior-year of $0.2 million of unamortized debt-issuance costs in connection with the amendment and restatement of the credit agreement.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P25_S5	The remaining $0.3 million was attributable to lower average borrowing rates in the fiscal year ended January 28, 2012.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P25_S6	Income Tax Expense For fiscal 2012, we recorded income tax expense of $37.1 million at an effective tax rate of 39.0%, which is consistent with U.S. federal and state statutory rates.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P25_S7	The change in our effective tax rate from fiscal 2011 reflects a more normalized rate due to being subject to corporate-level U.S. federal and state income taxes for the full fiscal year.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P25_S8	The effective tax rate also reflects a loss for the Japanese operations for which a tax benefit was not recognized.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P25_S9	For fiscal 2011, we recorded income tax expense of $5.5 million.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P25_S10	This expense was comprised of (1) $6.8 million of expense related to activity during the portion of fiscal 2011 that we were a C Corporation (October 3, 2010, through January 29, 2011) at an effective tax rate of 51.2% and (2) $0.5 million of state taxes related to taxing jurisdictions that did not recognize our previous S Corporation status, offset in part by a one-time deferred tax benefit of $1.8 million recognized upon the termination of our S Corporation status.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	for the portion of the fiscal year that we operated as a C Corporation was $1.2 million related to permanently non-deductible stock-based compensation expense associated with restricted-stock awards that vested in connection with our initial public offering.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	We also have access to additional liquidity, if needed, through borrowings under our $125.0 million amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Historically, our primary cash needs have been for merchandise inventories, payroll, store rent, capital expenditures associated with opening new stores, buildings, debt repayments, operational equipment, and information technology.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	The most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, merchandise inventories, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current liabilities.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	We do not believe that the expansion of our Direct business will materially increase borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement, in the near term.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P28_S3	We believe that cash flows from operating activities and the availability of borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement or other financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, and debt payments for the foreseeable future.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P28_S4	Cash Flow Analysis A summary of operating, investing, and financing activities is shown in the following table (in thousands):
1495320_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation, the effect of changes in assets and liabilities, and tenant-improvement allowances received from landlords under our store leases.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities was $51.5 million in fiscal 2013.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	Net income increased $10.9 million, non-cash changes in balances increased $12.8 million, and income taxes payable provided an incremental increase of $13.7 million, offset by working capital changes including an incremental inventory build of $24.6 million and an incremental reduction in accounts payable of $12.4 million.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P29_S3	Net cash provided by operating activities was $51.5 million for fiscal 2012 which was primarily driven by our net income in the current year.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P29_S4	This is slightly down from $58.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011, primarily due to additional income tax payments of $42.9 million in the current year because of the conversion from an S Corporation to a C Corporation in the prior year making us subject to corporate-level U.S. federal and state income taxes.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P29_S5	In addition, cash flow decreased due to timing of payments to our vendors, which was more than offset by the improvements in our supply chain and inventory management processes which allowed inventory levels to grow much less than in fiscal 2011.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for growth related to new store openings, buildings, operational equipment, and information technology investments.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Net cash used in investing activities was $35.9 million in fiscal 2013, compared to $18.8 million in fiscal 2012.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	The $17.1 million increase in capital expenditures was driven primarily by the expansion of the distribution facility.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	Net cash used in investing activities was $18.8 million in fiscal 2012, compared to $9.9 million in fiscal 2011.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P31_S3	The $8.9 million increase in capital expenditures was driven primarily by the investments in new stores, including the opening of 17 stores during fiscal 2012, expansion of the distribution facility, and information technology investments.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P31_S4	Net cash used in investing activities was $9.9 million in fiscal 2011, reflecting capital expenditures of $11.4 million offset in part by $1.5 million of cash provided as a result of the elimination of a compensating balance requirement in connection with the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P31_S5	Capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 are expected to be approximately $20 million, including the build-out of new stores and continued investment in our systems, including the e-commerce platform.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P31_S6	Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $10.8 million in fiscal 2013, primarily resulting from $10.0 million net payments under our amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P31_S7	Net cash used in financing activities was $41.8 million in fiscal 2012, resulting from the net payments under our amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P31_S8	Net cash used in financing activities was $41.2 million in fiscal 2011, driven primarily by $132.8 million of S Corporation distributions (including the final S Corporation distribution of $106.0 million) and $1.1 million of debt-issuance costs, offset in part by IPO net proceeds of $56.3 million and net borrowings of $36.8 million under the credit agreement or amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On October 4, 2010, Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. entered into an agreement to amend and restate our credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, as administrative agent, and certain other lenders.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	The amended and restated credit agreement provides for a revolving credit commitment of $125.0 million and matures on October 3, 2015.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	All borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P32_S3	The credit agreement is also guaranteed by the Company.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P32_S4	The credit agreement requires us to comply with various financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.20 to 1.00 and a leverage ratio of not more than 3.50 to 1.00.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P32_S5	The agreement also contains various other covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of certain indebtedness, liens, investments, acquisitions, and asset sales.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P32_S6	We were in compliance with these covenants as of February 2, 2013.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement bear interest at either LIBOR plus the applicable margin (ranging from 1.05% to 2.05%) or the alternate base rate (as defined in the agreement) plus the applicable margin (ranging from 0.05% to 1.05%).
1495320_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	The applicable margin is tied to our leverage ratio.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	In addition, we are required to pay a quarterly facility fee (as defined in the agreement) ranging from 0.20% to 0.45% of the revolving credit commitment.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	At February 2, 2013, the weighted-average interest rate on the $15.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement was 1.3%.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	We had borrowing availability of $110.0 million under the agreement as of February 2, 2013.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	On June 1, 2012, Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. entered into an amendment to the credit agreement.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	The amendment extends the maturity date from October 3, 2015 to June 1, 2017.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P35_S2	Certain permitted indebtedness covenants were also amended.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	We enter into long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily debt obligations and non-cancellable operating leases.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	As of February 2, 2013, our contractual cash obligations over the next several periods are as follows:
1495320_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	(1) As of February 2, 2013, we had $15.0 million principal amount due on June 1, 2017 under our amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	Estimated total interest and facility fee payments of $1.5 million, due through June 1, 2017, based on our outstanding borrowings and the interest rates in effect under our amended and restated credit agreement as of February 2, 2013, have been excluded.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	(2) We have entered into financing agreements with certain vendors.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	The amounts listed represent the outstanding balances under these agreements.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	(3) Our store leases generally have initial lease terms of 10 years without renewal options.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	Our future operating lease obligations would change if we were to extend these leases, or if we were to enter into new operating leases.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	(4) Purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchase.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	In addition, due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our uncertain tax positions at February 2, 2013, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	Therefore, $1.2 million of uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosures relating to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	We evaluate our accounting policies, estimates, and judgments on an on-going basis.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P43_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P43_S4	We evaluate the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and believe that the following policies and estimates involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position, and are therefore discussed as critical.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	The following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent results of operations.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	statements, however, have not been materially impacted by such variances.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	More information on all of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from the sale of our products is recognized upon customer receipt of the product when collection of the associated receivables is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and ownership and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, which, for e-commerce and most Indirect sales, reflects an estimate of shipments that customers have not yet received.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	The adjustment of these shipments is based on actual delivery dates to the customer.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	Significant changes in shipping terms or delivery times could materially impact our revenues in a given period.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	We reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	In the Direct business returns are refunded by issuing the same payment tender of the original purchase and in the Indirect business the customer is issued a credit to its account to apply to outstanding invoices.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	Merchandise exchanges of the same product at the same price are not considered merchandise returns.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	Product returns are often resalable through our annual outlet sale or other channels.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	Additionally, we reserve for other potential product credits and for customer shipments not yet received.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P49_S3	The total reserve for returns, customer shipments not yet received, and general credits was $4.1 million and $2.6 million at February 2, 2013, and January 28, 2012, respectively.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P49_S4	This represents a reduction to operating income of $2.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	Market is determined based on net realizable value, which includes costs to dispose.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P50_S3	Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excess quantities, and other factors, including the popularity of a pattern or product, in evaluating net realizable value.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	We record valuation adjustments to our inventories, which are reflected in cost of sales, if the cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	This adjustment calculation requires us to make assumptions and estimates, which are based on factors such as merchandise seasonality, historical trends, and estimated sales and inventory levels, including sell-through of remaining units.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	In addition, as part of inventory adjustments, we provide for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from our physical inventory counts.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P51_S3	We perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrink provision accordingly.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P51_S4	Inventory adjustments of $3.5 million and $3.3 million were recorded for these matters during the fiscal year ended February 2, 2013, and January 28, 2012, respectively.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P51_S5	These adjustments related primarily to raw materials of retired patterns, as we have the ability to move retired finished goods through a number of channels, including the annual outlet sale, our website and outlet stores, and through liquidators as needed.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	Income Taxes Prior to October 3, 2010, we were taxed as an S Corporation for federal income tax purposes under Section 1362 of the Internal Revenue Code, and therefore were not subject to federal and state income taxes (subject to exception in a limited number of state and local jurisdictions that do not recognize the S Corporation status).
1495320_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	On October 3, 2010, our S Corporation status automatically terminated and we became subject to corporate-level federal and state income taxes at prevailing corporate rates.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	Our effective tax rate is based on our pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P52_S3	Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained; (2) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	Taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	We believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	Taxing authorities, however, may take a contrary position.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P54_S3	Our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if, upon final resolution with taxing authorities, we prevail in positions for which we have established reserves, or are required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	Valuation of Long-lived Assets Property, plant, and equipment assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	In evaluating an asset for recoverability, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset at the store level, the lowest identifiable level of cash flow, if applicable.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset is less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, usually determined by an estimated discounted cash flow analysis of the asset.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Factors used in the valuation of long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, our plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results, and projected future cash flows.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	With respect to our stores, we analyze store economics, location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies in our selection process.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Impairment charges are classified in SG A expenses.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	The discounted cash flow models used to estimate the applicable fair values involve numerous estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	Changes to these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the fair value estimates.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	The estimates and assumptions critical to the overall fair value estimates include: (1) estimated future cash flow generated at the store level; and (2) discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair values.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P60_S3	These and other estimates and assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and our expectations and may change in the future based on period-specific facts and circumstances.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P60_S4	If economic conditions were to deteriorate, future impairment charges may be required.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2011-05, C omprehensive Income Presentation of Comprehensive Income .
1495320_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	This guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the Statement of Shareholders Equity.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	Instead, the Company must report comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections, net income and other comprehensive income, or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P61_S3	While the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income, there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P61_S4	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P61_S5	In accordance with this guidance, we have presented two separate but consecutive statements which include the components of net income and other comprehensive income.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	In May 2011, FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	The guidance requires additional disclosures, including disclosures related to the measurement of level 3 assets.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and is applied prospectively.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1495320_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	Transactions with Related Parties See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, of this report for information regarding transactions with related parties.
1495320_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement, which bear interest at variable rates.
1495320_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The amended and restated credit agreement allows for a revolving credit commitment of $125.0 million, bearing interest at a variable rate, based on either LIBOR plus the applicable margin (ranging from 1.05% to 2.05%) or the alternate base rate (as defined in the agreement) plus the applicable margin (ranging from 0.05% to 1.05%).
1495320_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Assuming the amended and restated credit agreement is fully drawn, each quarter point increase or decrease in the interest rate would change our annual interest expense by approximately $0.3 million.
1495320_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	From time to time, we utilize interest rate swaps to hedge our interest rate risk.
1495320_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	We had no open derivative instruments at February 2, 2013.
1495320_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Impact of Inflation Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost.
1495320_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Although it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial.
1495320_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We source a substantial majority of our materials from various suppliers in China and South Korea.
1495320_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Substantially all purchases and sales involving foreign persons are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore we do not hedge using any derivative instruments.
1495320_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Historically, we have not been impacted materially by changes in exchange rates.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vera Bradley, Inc.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P0_S1	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Vera Bradley, Inc. and its subsidiaries at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 2, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P0_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1495320_13_ITEM8_P0_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P0_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits (which were integrated audits in 2013 and 2012).
1495320_13_ITEM8_P0_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1495320_13_ITEM8_P0_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P0_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P0_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P0_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P0_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P1_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P1_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1495320_13_ITEM8_P7_S0	Description of the Company Vera Bradley, Inc. was formed as an Indiana corporation on June 23, 2010, for the purpose of reorganizing the corporate structure of Vera Bradley Designs, Inc.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P7_S1	On October 3, 2010, the shareholders of Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. contributed all of their shares of Class A Voting Common Stock and Class B Non-Voting Common Stock of Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. to Vera Bradley, Inc. in return for shares of Vera Bradley, Inc.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P7_S2	Class A Voting Common Stock and Class B Non-Voting Common Stock on a one-for-one basis.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P7_S3	In addition, effective October 3, 2010, Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. converted from an S Corporation to a C Corporation for income-tax purposes.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P7_S4	Further, on October 18, 2010, Vera Bradley, Inc. recapitalized all of its Class A Voting Common Stock and Class B Non-Voting Common Stock into a single class of common stock and effectuated a 35.437-for-1 stock split of all outstanding shares of its common stock.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P7_S5	These events collectively are referred to as the Reorganization.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P7_S6	As a result of the Reorganization, Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Vera Bradley, Inc.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P7_S7	Except where context requires or where otherwise indicated, the terms Company and Vera Bradley refer to Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. and its subsidiaries before the Reorganization and to Vera Bradley, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Vera Bradley Designs, Inc., after the Reorganization.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P7_S8	All historical common stock and per share common stock information has been changed to reflect the stock split.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P8_S0	Vera Bradley is a leading designer, producer, marketer, and retailer of stylish, highly functional accessories for women.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P8_S1	The Company s products include a wide offering of handbags, accessories, and travel and leisure items.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P8_S2	The Company generates net revenues by selling products through two reportable segments: Direct and Indirect.
1495320_13_ITEM8_P8_S3	The Direct segment consists of sales of Vera Bradley products through our 65 full-price stores, our 11 outlet stores in the United States, 15 department store locations in Japan, our websites, verabradley.com and verabradley.co.jp, and our annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

1495320_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Evolution of Our Business Beginning in 2005, we embarked on a series of strategic initiatives designed to take advantage of the growing interest in the Vera Bradley brand.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	These initiatives were designed to strengthen and enhance our business and operating model, expand our demographic and geographic market opportunity, and position us for future growth.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	The core components of these initiatives included the following: Merchandising Strategy.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P16_S3	To appeal to a broader range of consumers, we developed a mix of pattern and product offerings specifically targeted at different consumer demographics and refined our product release strategy to expand our product portfolio.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P16_S4	In addition, we substantially enhanced our visual merchandising strategy, focusing on a consistent presentation of Vera Bradley as a lifestyle brand.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P16_S5	In fiscal 2012, we established a dedicated merchant function and elevated the role of marketing to work more collaboratively with the design team to continue improving our process of bringing products to market.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	In 2006, we initiated a Direct channel strategy that was designed to expand our brand presence and broaden our consumer demographic while complementing the growing Indirect segment of our business.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	The first step in establishing the Direct segment of our business was selling directly to consumers through verabradley.com beginning in 2006.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	In fiscal 2014, we had more than 69 million visits to verabradley.com.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	In September 2007, we opened our first full-price store.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	As of February 1, 2014, we operated 84 full-price stores and 15 outlet stores in the United States, and 13 department store locations in Japan.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	Beginning in 2005, we made a series of investments to strengthen our supply chain capabilities, information systems, and product development processes, resulting in substantial cost savings and a more flexible and scalable operating structure.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	During this period, we shifted our production from a primarily domestic manufacturing model to a more cost-effective global sourcing platform.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P19_S2	In 2007, we opened a state-of-the-art distribution facility in Roanoke, Indiana, which was doubled in size to approximately 400,000 square feet as a result of an expansion that was completed in fiscal 2013.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	In March 2014, the Company refined its strategic initiatives by unveiling its comprehensive five-year strategic plan, designed to drive improved financial performance and shareholder value over the long-term.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	The vision is to build on the Company's rich heritage and establish Vera Bradley as a premium lifestyle brand that is relevant to the future, expanding our customer reach and growing our customer connections.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our Brand For over 30 years, we have created, developed, and solidified a true lifestyle brand that resonates with a broad range of female consumers.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	Employees, family members, and friends are often depicted throughout our advertising in fun, friendly, and family-oriented settings, accentuating our brand image in an authentic manner.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	Our visual merchandising strategy, particularly in our full-price stores, seeks to create the feeling of home.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P21_S3	We believe that our lifestyle brand is well positioned to extend into complementary product categories.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P21_S4	The strength of our brand is demonstrated during our annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana, a sales event that attracts tens of thousands of highly enthusiastic shoppers from across the country.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P21_S5	Our brand positioning emphasizes the high quality, distinctive and vibrant styling, and functional design of our products.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P21_S6	At the same time, our releases of new patterns and styles keep the brand fresh, inspire our customers to express their individuality and sense of style in a colorful way, and encourage multiple purchases.

1495320_14_ITEM1_P24_S13	This channel of gift, apparel and accessories, travel, and other specialty retailers, located throughout the United States, provides a strong foundation for our growth.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P24_S14	Our Indirect retailers include some of the brand s strongest advocates, and their passion has been instrumental in the development of our brand.

1495320_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	We were founded in 1982 by two friends, Barbara Bradley Baekgaard and Patricia Miller, who built our company around their passion for design and commitment to customer service.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	We believe our founders created a unique company culture that attracts passionate and motivated employees who are excited about our products and our brand.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	Our employees share our founders commitment to Vera Bradley customers.

1495320_14_ITEM1_P26_S4	Our senior management team led by Robert Wallstrom, our Chief Executive Officer, has extensive experience across a diverse range of disciplines in product design, merchandising, marketing, store operations and development, supply chain management, and finance.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	In March 2014, the Company unveiled its comprehensive five-year strategic plan, designed to drive improved financial performance and shareholder value over the long-term.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	We intend to achieve this vision through the following three key elements: Product.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	We will begin offering an elevated product assortment, which will extend our price offering and build aspiration by creating halo product in new fabrications that build on our core assortment.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P27_S3	We will work to stabilize the business by majoring in the majors, making a bigger impact in the classifications Vera Bradley is known for and what we do best, like travel, backpacks, bags, and accessories.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P27_S4	We will also invest in emerging growth and brand-enhancing opportunities that will strengthen the core of the future, such as scarves and jewelry.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P27_S5	Our product assortment will be more focused and more narrowed in the short term by paring the number of signature patterns launched each year and reducing the style count.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P27_S6	We will add more solids to the assortment to showcase our signature patterns even more and add career elements into our assortment, which we believe will help expand our customer base.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	Every product launch will not be treated equally - as they generally are today - and will have a predetermined lifecycle.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	We will pursue brand extensions that will enhance our position as a lifestyle brand via a structured approach.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P28_S2	We will shape Vera Bradley into a tightly integrated multi-channel business by growing our Direct distribution channel (including full-line stores, factory outlet stores, and e-commerce), right-size and work to strengthen the performance in our gift channel, and further develop our department store and other Indirect channel relationships.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P28_S3	We continue to have a long-term vision of around 300 full-line and 100 factory outlet Vera Bradley stores.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P28_S4	We plan to add 13 new full-line stores in fiscal 2015 and believe we can accelerate that pace beginning in fiscal 2016 to add approximately 20 to 25 new stores per year for at least the next four years.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P28_S5	We expect to add at least seven new outlet stores in fiscal 2015.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P28_S6	We believe that we can accelerate this growth rate going forward to approximately 10 to 15 new stores per year for at least the next four years.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P28_S7	Furthermore, within three years, we expect approximately 40% of the product in the outlet channel to be made specifically for our outlets, growing to approximately 70% in a five-year time frame.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P28_S8	We believe this made-for-outlet ( MFO ) strategy is a profitable financial model which should drive both sales and gross margins.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P28_S9	E-commerce will be a key part of the foundation to support our brand and marketing strategies.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P28_S10	Our eventual goal is for the e-commerce experience to mirror the in-store shopping experience by segregating our full-line and factory outlet product onto different sites.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P28_S11	We will be placing greater focus on our department store relationships and we will continue to explore other expansion opportunities in the department store space, especially since this is the number one destination for career handbag purchasing.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	The Indirect specialty gift channel is the heritage of our business and remains very important to us.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	We will continue to add select accounts while discontinuing unproductive accounts.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P29_S2	While the specialty gift business is rapidly becoming a much smaller percentage of our total revenue base, it is still an important piece of our business, and we are working hard to stabilize this channel by narrowing our product assortments, changing the order cycle, and doing a better job of segmenting our assortments by door.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P29_S3	Our marketing goal will be to generate excitement and desire for the aspirational Vera Bradley brand, attracting new customers while continuing to foster strong connections with our loyal fan base.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P29_S4	We plan to build a cohesive brand story that connects with our target customers, and more of our marketing will be allocated to the halo brand-enhancing assortments and less to what is already well-known.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P29_S5	We will advertise the brand in relevant national magazines and leverage our database and insights to conduct more segmented, and even personalized, digital and direct mail marketing.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	Within each season, we generally introduce two to four patterns.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	These patterns are incorporated into the designs of a wide range of products, including handbags, accessories, and travel and leisure items, that are part of the core seasonal release.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	These product assortments each season can be classic styles, updates to older designs, or new product introductions.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	To keep our assortment current and fresh and to focus our inventory investments on our best performers, we discontinue patterns at regular intervals.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	We sell our remaining inventory of retired products primarily through our website, outlet stores, and at our annual outlet sale.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P31_S2	The following chart presents net revenues generated by each of our three product categories and other revenues as a percentage of our total net revenues for fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 :
1495320_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	(1) Includes primarily home, merchandising, freight, and licensing revenues.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	(2) Excludes net revenues generated by our annual outlet sale.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	Handbags are a core part of our product offerings and are the primary component of every seasonal assortment.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	The category consists of classic and new styles developed by our product development team to meet consumer demand and drive repeat purchases.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	Our handbag product category extends beyond handbags to include totes and specialty bags such as crossbodies, baby bags, backpacks, and laptop portfolios.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P34_S2	Handbags play a prominent role in our visual merchandising, and we focus on showcasing the different patterns, colors, and features of each bag.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	Accessories, our second largest revenue category, include technology accessories and fashion accessories such as wallets, wristlets, eyeglass cases, cosmetics cases, and paper and gift products.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	Our accessories are attractively priced and allow the consumer to include some color in her wardrobe, even if tucked into another bag.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	Our product development team consistently updates the accessories assortment based on consumer demand and fashion trends.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P35_S3	Our travel and leisure product category includes duffel bags, garment bags, rolling luggage, and travel accessories, such as travel cosmetic cases.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	The first Vera Bradley product offering included duffel bags, which consistently have been a strong performer.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	We believe their popularity, as well as the appeal of our other travel and leisure items, results from our vibrant designs, functional styles, and lightweight fabrications.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P36_S2	We have implemented a fully integrated and cross-functional product development process that aligns design, market research, merchandise management, sales, marketing, and sourcing.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P36_S3	Product development is a core capability that makes our products unique and provides us with a competitive advantage.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P36_S4	Our designs and aesthetics set our products apart and drive customer loyalty.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P36_S5	Our product development team mixes an understanding of the needs of our target customers, with knowledge of upcoming color and fashion trends, to design new collections as well as new product categories that will resonate in the market.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P36_S6	We typically begin the development stage of our products in the Vera Bradley portfolio 12 18 months in advance of their release.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P36_S7	The development of each new pattern includes the design of an overall print, a complementary fabric backing, and three sizes of coordinating trim materials.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P36_S8	To seek fresh perspectives, we collaborate with independent designers to create unique patterns for each season.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P36_S9	We oversee the development and exercise the final approval of all patterns and designs.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P36_S10	Once developed, we generally copyright each pattern, including the print, fabric backing and coordinating trim.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P36_S11	We believe that great design is not only central to our product development efforts, but also is a fundamental part of our brand development and growth strategies.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P36_S12	In the past several years, we have made investments to evolve and integrate our product development expertise, including opening a design office in New York City, as well as opening a design center in Roanoke, Indiana.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P36_S13	Our product development team works to ensure that new collections contain an assortment of products and styles that are in line with both fashion trends and customer needs and regularly updates classic styles to enhance functionality.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P36_S14	In addition, we actively pursue opportunities to expand our product offerings through new line and brand extensions.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P36_S15	Our product development team monitors fashion trends and customer needs by attending major trend shows in Europe and the United States, subscribing to trend monitoring services, and engaging in comparison-shopping.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our product development team is also responsible for assortment planning, pricing, forecasting, promotional development, and product lifecycle management.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	Forecasting is based on seasonal market research and in-store testing.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	We gather seasonal market research through a variety of methodologies, including scheduled interviews and online and in-person surveys.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P38_S2	We conduct seasonal in-store testing by releasing test products in our full-price stores and evaluating their success in the marketplace prior to product introduction on a larger scale.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P38_S3	The team assures that we offer a broad range of patterns, fabrics, styles, and functionality features in a cost-effective manner.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P38_S4	We believe that with our cross-functional, collaborative approach, we are able to introduce and sell our merchandise in a way that clearly communicates the Vera Bradley brand and the Vera Bradley lifestyle.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P38_S5	Marketing We believe that the growth of our brand and our business is influenced by our ability to introduce and sell our merchandise in a way that clearly conveys the Vera Bradley lifestyle.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P38_S6	We use marketing as a critical tool in our efforts to promote our brand.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P38_S7	The seasonal Vera Bradley catalogs are key vehicles for promoting the brand and product portfolio.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P38_S8	Each catalog is sent to a targeted customer mailing list.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P38_S9	In addition to distributing the catalog, we produce and distribute a number of other marketing pieces, including postcards and mini-mailers.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P38_S10	We believe our direct mail media generate excitement and awareness about the brand and seasonal introductions and allow us to reach both new and loyal customers in their homes.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P38_S11	We employ print and outdoor advertising to increase overall brand awareness.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P38_S12	Our advertisements are placed primarily in national magazines that have a readership similar to our target demographics.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P38_S13	These publications have recently included Seventeen, InStyle, Better Homes and Gardens, and Real Simple .
1495320_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	We continually assess our advertising strategies and tactics.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	Vera Bradley has received considerable exposure in the press, including in publications such as InStyle, O the Oprah Magazine, Good Housekeeping, Southern Living, and The New York Times .
1495320_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	In addition, we have expanded our marketing efforts to promote product placement in feature-length films and on prime-time television shows such as Modern Family and New Girl .
1495320_14_ITEM1_P40_S2	In recent years, we have greatly increased traffic to verabradley.com and have increased awareness of our brand through online marketing and social networking sites.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P40_S3	We have captured more than 2.8 million customer e-mail addresses in our online customer file, with many of these customers providing age, occupation, and location data.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P40_S4	This captured information provides us with deeper insight into the products and categories that are in the highest demand, and allows us to better target our customers with appropriate messages.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P40_S5	As of February 1, 2014 , we had approximately 1.6 million Facebook fans, over 65 thousand Twitter followers, and over 7.9 million visits to our blog, The Inside Stitch .
1495320_14_ITEM1_P40_S6	We believe these media not only connect us with our fans, but also allow us to target them through cross-channel marketing.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	Seasonality Because Vera Bradley products are frequently given as gifts, Vera Bradley has historically realized, and expects to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of November and December.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P41_S2	Over the last several years, we have achieved higher levels of growth in the non-holiday quarters, which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	Channels of Distribution We distribute our products through our Direct and Indirect segments.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	This multi-channel distribution model not only enables us to have operational flexibility, but also maximizes the methods by which we can access potential customers.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	We have developed a retail presence through our full-price stores, all located in the United States, which provides us with a format to showcase the image and products of Vera Bradley.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P42_S3	As of February 1, 2014, we operated 84 full-price stores averaging approximately 1,800 square feet per store.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P42_S4	Our stores are designed to create a feeling of home with a high standard of visual merchandising.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P42_S5	The welcoming nature of our full-price stores provides our customers with a comfortable shopping experience in a setting that showcases our merchandise and conveys the Vera Bradley lifestyle.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P42_S6	Our sales associates are passionate about our products and customer service, which, we believe, translates into a superior shopping experience.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	In 2006, we began selling our products through the verabradley.com website.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	The objective of verabradley.com is to provide both a mechanism for marketing directly to consumers and a storefront where consumers can find the entire Vera Bradley collection.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P43_S2	In fiscal 2013, we invested in upgrades to our website allowing for a more user friendly homepage, enabling us to ship to over 13 international countries, and enhancing the checkout experience.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P43_S3	In fiscal 2014, we migrated our website to a responsive design in order to provide a better shopping experience for our customers by providing an optimal viewing experience regardless of the device being used to shop.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P43_S4	We had over 69 million visits to verabradley.com during fiscal 2014.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	Our outlet stores are a vehicle for selling retired merchandise at discounted prices, while maintaining brand integrity.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P44_S1	We believe our outlet stores are an integral part of our distribution strategy, as this format provides an additional channel of distribution for our products and enables us to better target value-oriented customers.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P44_S2	Our outlet stores average approximately 3,000 square feet per store.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P44_S3	As of February 1, 2014, we operated 15 outlet stores.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	We launched a marketing campaign to connect with the Japanese consumer on April 18, 2011.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	This campaign included seven temporary pop-up stores in several department stores including Isetan Shinjuku and Marui Yurakucho located across Tokyo and Kyoto.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P45_S2	The international channel includes the Japanese website verabradley.co.jp launched in fiscal 2012.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	As of February 1, 2014, we operated 13 Japanese department store locations.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	Our annual outlet sale is held in the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum Exposition Center in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P46_S2	The annual outlet sale is an important tradition for Vera Bradley, has many loyal followers, and is an opportunity for us to sell our retired merchandise at discounted prices in a brand-right fashion.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P46_S3	We attracted approximately 68 thousand attendees to our 2013 annual outlet sale.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our store location decisions are made case by case, depending on the retail strategy we have developed for the particular market.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P47_S1	This includes actual and planned penetration in both Indirect and Direct segments, as well as existing e-commerce demand.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P47_S2	At this time, we do not believe any market has been fully penetrated.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P47_S3	We believe that expansion of our store base complements our Indirect segment by increasing brand awareness and reinforcing our brand image.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	In addition to analyzing store economics, we pay particular attention to the location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	Along with seeking co-tenants that we believe share our target customer, we seek a balanced mix of moderate and high-end retailers to encourage high levels of traffic.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P48_S2	Our target full-price store size is approximately 1,800 square feet, but we are able to work with spaces as small as 1,000 square feet or, depending on our market strategy and relevant economic factors, spaces as large as 2,800 square feet.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	The focus of our store operations is providing consumers with a comfortable shopping experience.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	We strive to make the experience interactive through special store events, such as showcasing newly launched products or celebrating our namesake s birthday.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P49_S2	Our customer service philosophy emphasizes friendly service, merchandise knowledge, and passion for the brand.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P49_S3	Consequently, an essential requirement for the success of our stores is our ability to attract, train, and retain talented, highly motivated district managers, store managers, and sales associates.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P49_S4	Our district and store managers are our primary link to the consumer, and we continually invest in their development.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P49_S5	We believe that our innovative retail concept and distinctive retail experience contribute to the success of our stores, most of which generate strong productivity and returns.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P49_S6	We expect our full-price stores to average approximately 1,800 square feet per store, and we expect to invest approximately $0.4 million per new store, consisting of inventory costs, pre-opening costs, and build-out costs, less tenant-improvement allowances.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P49_S7	New full-price stores generate on average between $1.2 million and $1.4 million in net revenues during the first twelve months, and the payback on our investment is expected to occur in less than 18 months.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P49_S8	As of February 1, 2014, we had approximately 3,100 Indirect retailer partners, the majority of which were specialty retailers with whom we have had long-standing relationships.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P49_S9	The top 30% of our specialty retailers account for over 70% of revenue from our specialty retailers.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P49_S10	No single account represented more than 5% of total Indirect net revenues in fiscal 2014, with the top ten accounts representing in the aggregate less than 24% of total Indirect net revenues.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P49_S11	The majority of our Indirect retailers have been customers for over five years.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P49_S12	In fiscal 2012, we launched our products in the department store channel.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	Sales Force We believe that having an in-house sales force results in more consistent brand presentation and messaging, enhanced support for our Indirect retailers, and a more predictable, scalable, and cost-efficient business model.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	As of February 1, 2014, our sales team consisted of 84 in-house, full-time sales consultants.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P50_S2	The compensation structure for our sales consultants consists of a combination of fixed pay and sales-based incentives.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P50_S3	In addition to acquiring new and growing existing accounts, our sales consultants serve as a support center for our Indirect retailers by assisting and educating them in areas such as merchandising and visual presentation, marketing of the brand, product selection, and inventory management.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P50_S4	Our sales consultants also participate in our semi-annual product introduction and education event for our Indirect retailers.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P50_S5	Our visual merchandising program provides our sales consultants with a framework to guide our Indirect retailers regarding optimal product placement and display that is intended to reinforce the message that our brand is distinct from those of our competitors.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	Manufacturing and Supply Chain Model Our manufacturing and supply chain model is designed to maximize flexibility in order to meet shifting demands in the market.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	Our model utilizes offshore raw material suppliers and a blend of offshore and domestic manufacturing.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P51_S2	We place a strong emphasis on continuous improvement and have employed lean manufacturing concepts.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P51_S3	Our broad-based, multi-country manufacturing and supply chain model is designed to achieve efficient, timely, and accurate order fulfillment while maintaining appropriate levels of inventory.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P51_S4	Our sourcing strategy is part of the larger cross-functional product development process.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P51_S5	The overall objective for our sourcing team is to build and sustain collaborative partnerships throughout our supply chain, with a focus on identifying appropriate countries and partners to manufacture our products.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P51_S6	The sourcing team leverages its expertise in negotiation, relationship management, and change management to maintain a strong global supply chain.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P51_S7	We strive to maintain the appropriate balance of inventory to enable us to provide a high level of service to our customers, including prompt and accurate delivery of our products.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P51_S8	We have an active sales and operations planning process that helps us balance the supply and demand issues that we encounter in our business, optimize our inventory levels, and anticipate inventory needs.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P51_S9	We have also integrated our planning, forecasting, and segmentation processes under one function called Merchandise Planning and Allocation.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	The majority of our products are cotton-based.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	Our other products are made primarily from specialty fabrics (including nylon and microfiber) and paper.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P52_S2	We source our materials from various suppliers in Asia, with the majority coming from China and South Korea.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P52_S3	Our global supply chain and purchasing teams work together with select suppliers enabling us to optimize the mix of cost, lead time, quality, and reliability within our global supply network.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P52_S4	All of our suppliers must comply with our quality standards, and we use only a limited number of pre-approved suppliers who have demonstrated a commitment to delivering the highest quality products.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P52_S5	In December 2008, we opened an office in Dongguan, China, which enables us to increase our control over the manufacturing and supply chain process and monitor compliance with our quality standards.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	A significant majority of our finished goods products are manufactured externally overseas.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P53_S1	These products are made by a variety of global manufacturers located primarily in China.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P53_S2	We are not dependent upon any single manufacturer for our products.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P53_S3	When determining the size of orders placed with our manufacturers, we take into account forward-looking demand, lead times for specific products, current inventory levels, and minimum order quantity requirements.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	Overseas production has resulted in substantial cost savings and a reduction of capital investment.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	With the oversight of our office in China and our independent contractors, we believe these financial benefits have been realized without sacrificing the level of quality inherent in our products or service to our customers.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P54_S2	The remainder of our products are manufactured in the United States to provide flexibility in our supply chain.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P54_S3	This production, almost all of which is internal to Vera Bradley, enables us to manufacture a finished product in two weeks.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P54_S4	This capability allows us to respond quickly to shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P54_S5	In fiscal 2014, approximately 6.1% of our units were produced in our domestic manufacturing facility.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P54_S6	In 2007, we consolidated our warehousing and shipping functions into one, 217,320 square-foot distribution center, located in Roanoke, Indiana.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P54_S7	In fiscal 2013, we completed a 200,000 square-foot expansion of the distribution facility.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P54_S8	This highly automated, computerized facility allows Vera Bradley employees to receive information directly from the order-collection center and quickly identify the products and quantities necessary for a particular order.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P54_S9	The recent expansion resulted in capacity gains in the areas of inbound receiving, inventory storage, order fulfillment, value-add processing and shipping.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P54_S10	The facility s advanced technology enables us to more accurately process and pack orders, as well as track shipments and inventory.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	We believe that our systems for the processing and shipment of orders from our distribution center have enabled us to improve our overall customer service through enhanced order accuracy and reduced turnaround time.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	We strive to maintain the appropriate balance of inventory to enable us to provide a high level of service to our customers, including prompt and accurate delivery of our products.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P55_S2	We have an active Merchandise Planning and Allocation function that strives to balance the supply and demand issues that we encounter in our business, optimize our inventory levels, and anticipate inventory needs.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P55_S3	Our products are shipped primarily via FedEx and common carriers to our stores, our Indirect retailers, and directly to our customers who purchase through our website.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P55_S4	We believe we are positioned well to support the order fulfillment requirements of our growing business, including business generated through our website.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P55_S5	We believe that high levels of automation and technology are essential to maintain our competitive position.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P55_S6	We maintain computer hardware, systems applications, and networks to enhance and accelerate the design process, to support the sale and distribution of our products to our customers, and to improve the integration and efficiency of our operations.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P55_S7	Our management information systems are designed to provide, among other things, comprehensive order processing, production, accounting, and management information for the product development, retail, sales, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, finance, and human resources functions of our business.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P55_S8	We use several systems, including MICROS-Retail, SAP, JDA, and SCALE, for our information technology requirements.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	Competition We face strong competition in each of the product lines and markets in which we compete.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	We believe that all of our products are in similar competitive positions with respect to the number of competitors they face and the level of competition within each product line.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P56_S2	Due to the number of different products we offer, it is not practicable for us to quantify the number of competitors we face.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P56_S3	Our products compete with other branded products within their product categories and with private label products sold by retailers.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P56_S4	In our Indirect business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers, and distributors of handbags, accessories, and other products for the limited space available for the display of such products to the consumer.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P56_S5	Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	In our Direct business, we compete against other independent retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, gift retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	The market for handbags, in particular, is highly competitive.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	Our competitors include not only established companies that are expanding their production and marketing of handbags, but also frequent new entrants to the market.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P57_S3	We directly compete with wholesalers and direct sellers of branded handbags and accessories, such as Coach, Nine West, Liz Claiborne, Dooney Bourke, Kate Spade, and Michael Kors.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P57_S4	In varying degrees, depending on the product category involved, we compete on the basis of design (aesthetic appeal), quality (construction), function, price point, distribution, and brand positioning.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P57_S5	We believe that our primary competitive advantages are consumer recognition of our brand, customer loyalty, product development expertise, and our widespread presence through our multi-channel distribution model.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P57_S6	Some of our competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources than we do.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P57_S7	Further, we may face new competitors and increased competition from existing competitors as we expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	Copyrights and Trademarks The development of each new pattern includes the design of an overall print, a complementary fabric backing, and coordinating trim materials.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P58_S1	Once developed, we generally copyright each pattern, including the print, fabric backing, and coordinating trim.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P58_S2	We currently have in excess of 650 copyrights.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P58_S3	We also own all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing, and distribution of all of our products, both in the United States and in the other countries in which our products are principally sold.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P58_S4	We aggressively police our trademarks and copyrights and pursue infringers and counterfeiters both domestically and internationally.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P58_S5	Our trademarks will remain in existence for as long as we continue to use and renew them on their expiration dates.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	Employees As of February 1, 2014, we had approximately 2,900 employees.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	Of the total, 1,850 were engaged in retail selling positions, 350 were engaged in manufacturing functions, 35 were engaged in product design, and 325 were engaged in corporate support and administrative functions.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P59_S2	The remaining employees were engaged in other aspects of our business.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P59_S3	None of our employees are represented by a union.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P59_S4	We believe that our relations with our employees are good, and we have never encountered a significant work stoppage.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P59_S5	Many of our imported products are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs, or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the United States and other countries or impact the cost of such products.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P59_S6	To date, we have not been restricted by quotas in the operation of our business, and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of a majority of our products.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P59_S7	In addition, we are subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions, including U.S. retaliation against prohibited foreign practices, with respect to our product sourcing and international sales operations.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P59_S8	We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental matters, including the handling, transportation, and disposal of our products and our non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, and groundwater.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P59_S9	Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties, or the imposition of other liabilities.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect upon our earnings or financial position.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	If we violate any laws or regulations, however, it could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P60_S2	The following table sets forth certain information concerning each of our executive officers:
1495320_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	Robert Wallstrom has served as our Chief Executive Officer, President and Director since November 2013.
1495320_14_ITEM1_P61_S1	Prior to joining Vera Bradley, Mr. Wallstrom served as President of Saks Fifth Avenue s OFF 5TH division from 2007 until November 2013.

1495320_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	If we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategies or manage our growing business, our future operating results could suffer.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The success of our growth strategies, alone or collectively, will depend on various factors, including the appeal of our product designs, retail presentation to consumers, competitive conditions, and economic conditions.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If we are unsuccessful in implementing some or all of our strategies or initiatives, our future operating results could be adversely impacted.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Successful implementation of our strategies will require us to manage our growth.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P0_S4	To manage our growth effectively, we will need to continue to increase production while maintaining strict quality control.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P0_S5	We also will need to continue to improve and invest in our systems and processes to keep pace with planned increases in demand.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P0_S6	We could suffer a decline in sales if our products do not continue to meet our quality control standards or if we are unable to respond adequately to increases in customer demand for our products.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P0_S7	We are continuing to invest in our specialty retailers to support them in growing along with Vera Bradley.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P0_S8	This channel will continue to evolve over time as we balance the channel dynamics between the specialty retailers, department stores, our Direct stores, and e-commerce.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P0_S9	We sell our wholesale merchandise primarily to specialty retailers and department stores substantially located in the United States and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition, without requiring collateral.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P0_S10	However, the financial difficulties of a specialty retail customer could cause us to limit or eliminate our business with that customer.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P0_S11	Changes in general economic conditions, and their impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In recent years, consumer confidence and consumer spending deteriorated significantly, influenced by fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, changing fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, higher levels of unemployment and consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment, and weather and weather-related phenomenas.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty, and this could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	In the event of another significant economic downturn, we could experience lower than expected net revenues, which could force us to delay or slow the implementation of our growth strategies and adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our inability to predict and respond in a timely manner to changes in consumer demand could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Our success depends on our ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies consumer demand in a timely manner.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P1_S7	We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to develop appealing patterns and styles or meet changing consumer demands in the future.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P1_S8	If we misjudge the market for our products, we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P1_S9	In addition, changes to our product assortment, as well as the availability and breadth of pattern assortment may not gain consumer acceptance.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P1_S10	Merchandise misjudgments could adversely impact our net revenues and results of operations.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P1_S11	We may not be able to successfully open and operate new stores as planned, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P1_S12	Our continued growth will depend on our ability to successfully open and operate new stores.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P1_S13	We plan to open approximately 20 to 25 new stores during each of the next five fiscal years.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P1_S14	Our ability to successfully open and operate new stores depends on many factors, including our ability to:
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	successfully integrate new stores into our existing operations and information technology systems.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The success of new store openings may also be affected by our ability to initiate marketing efforts in advance of opening our first store in a particular region.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Additionally, we will encounter pre-operating costs and we may encounter initial losses while new stores commence operations, which could strain our resources and adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our business depends on a strong brand.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	If we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand, then we may be unable to sell our products, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We believe that the brand image that we have developed has contributed significantly to the success of our business.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	We also believe that maintaining and enhancing the Vera Bradley brand is critical to maintaining and expanding our customer base.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as product design, store operations, and community relations.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P3_S5	If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brand image, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Our results of operations could suffer if we lose key management or design associates or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P3_S7	Our performance depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and product development teams.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P3_S8	These executives and design associates have substantial experience in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P3_S9	Although we have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Wallstrom and certain of our other executive officers, including Ms. Fuller and Mr. Sierks, we may not be able to retain the services of such individuals in the future.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P3_S10	The unexpected loss of services of these individuals could have adverse impacts on our business and results of operations.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	As our business grows and we open new stores, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees and develop, train, and manage an increasing number of management-level, sales, and other employees.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Competition for qualified employees is intense.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain employees as needed in the future.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Our results of operations are subject to quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including, among other things:
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	the timing of new pattern releases and new product introductions.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	As a result of these quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our sales and operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Any quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	This could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	A data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, expose us to litigation risk and adversely affect our business.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We are dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet, for a significant portion of our Direct store sales, including our e-commerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We are also responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our e-commerce websites and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	As part of our normal course of business, we often collect, retain, and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information, over public networks.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	There is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Despite the security measures we currently have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Any electronic or physical security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, including penetration of our network security, whether by us or by a third-party, could disrupt our business, severely damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, expose us to risks of litigation and liability and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Since we do not control third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future, any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility, reduce our e-commerce net sales, impair our ability to attract website visitors and reduce our ability to attract and retain customers.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We may also incur significant costs in complying with the various applicable state, federal and foreign laws regarding unauthorized disclosure of personal information.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P7_S6	We are dependent on our computer systems to record and process transactions and manage and operate our business, including in designing, marketing, manufacturing, importing, tracking and distributing our products, processing payments, and accounting for and reporting results.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P7_S7	We also utilize an automated replenishment system to facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders, the movement of goods through distribution channels, and the collection of information for planning and forecasting.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P7_S8	In addition, we have e-commerce and other Internet websites in the U.S. and Japan.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Given the complexity of our business and the significant number of transactions that we engage in on an annual basis, it is imperative that we maintain constant operation of our computer hardware and software systems.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from, among other things, security breaches, computer viruses or power outages.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Any material disruptions in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Our inability to meet market expectations of comparable-store sales could cause our stock price to decline.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We may not be able to sustain the levels of comparable-store sales that we have experienced in the recent past.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P8_S5	If our future comparable-store sales fail to meet market expectations, then the price of our common stock could decline.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Also, the aggregate results of operations of our stores have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Numerous factors influence comparable-store sales, including fashion trends, competition, national and regional economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, inventory shrinkage, marketing programs, changes in consumer shopping trends towards on-line shopping, and weather conditions.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In addition, many companies with retail operations have been unable to sustain high levels of comparable-store sales during and after periods of substantial expansion.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	These factors may cause our comparable-store sales results to be lower in the future than in recent periods or lower than expectations, either of which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We currently own our distribution and design center facilities.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We lease our corporate headquarters, our other offices, and all of our store locations.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We typically occupy our stores under operating leases with terms of ten years.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We have been able to negotiate favorable rental rates in recent years due in part to the state of the economy and high vacancy rates within some shopping centers, but there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to negotiate such favorable terms.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Some of our leases have early cancellation clauses, which permit the lease to be terminated by us or the landlord if certain sales levels are not met in specific periods or if the shopping center does not meet specified occupancy standards.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P10_S6	In addition to requiring future minimum lease payments, some of our store leases provide for the payment of common area maintenance charges, real property insurance, and real estate taxes.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P10_S7	Many of our lease agreements have escalating rent provisions over the initial term and any extensions.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P10_S8	As we expand our store base, our lease expense and our cash outlays for rent under lease agreements will increase.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P10_S9	Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including:
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	limiting our ability to obtain additional financing.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Any of these consequences could place us at a disadvantage with respect to our competitors.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We depend on cash flow from operating activities to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses and needs, we may not be able to service our lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would harm our business.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Additional sites that we lease may be subject to long-term non-cancelable leases if we are unable to negotiate our current standard lease terms.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, including paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Moreover, even if a lease has an early cancellation clause, we may not satisfy the contractual requirements for early cancellation under the lease.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Our inability to enter new leases or renew existing leases on acceptable terms or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that we close would, in any such case, affect us adversely.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P12_S6	We operate in a competitive market.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P12_S7	Our competitors might develop products that are more popular with consumers than our products.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The market for handbags, accessories, and travel and leisure items is competitive.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	establishing and maintaining good working relationships with our Indirect retailers.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In our Indirect business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers, and distributors of handbags, accessories, and other products for the limited space available for the display of such products to the consumer.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	In our Direct business, we compete against other gift and specialty retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We rely on various contract manufacturers to produce a significant majority of our products and generally do not have long-term contracts with our manufacturers.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Disruptions in our contract manufacturers systems, losses of manufacturing certifications, or other actions by these manufacturers could increase our cost of sales, adversely affect our net revenues, and injure our reputation and customer relationships, thereby harming our business.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Our various contract manufacturers produce a significant majority of our products.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P14_S7	We generally do not enter into long-term formal written agreements with our manufacturers and instead transact business with each of them on an order-by-order basis.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P14_S8	In the event of a disruption in our contract manufacturers systems, we may be unable to locate alternative manufacturers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P14_S9	Identifying a suitable manufacturer is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with the prospective manufacturer s quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability, and labor practices.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P14_S10	Any delay, interruption, or increased cost in the manufactured products that might occur for any reason, such as the lack of long-term contracts or regulatory requirements and the loss of certifications, power interruptions, fires, hurricanes, war, or threats of terrorism, could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products, adversely affect our net revenues, increase our cost of sales, and hurt our results of operations.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P14_S11	In addition, manufacturing disruption could injure our reputation and customer relationships, thereby harming our business.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We rely on various suppliers to supply a significant majority of our raw materials.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Disruption in the supply of raw materials could increase our cost of goods sold and adversely affect our net revenues.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We generally do not enter into long-term formal written agreements with our suppliers and typically transact business with each of them on an order-by-order basis.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	As a result, we cannot assure that there will be no significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from our current sources or, in the event of a disruption, that we would be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We rely on a single distribution facility for all of the products we sell.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Disruption to that facility could adversely impact our results of operations, and expansion of that facility could have unpredictable adverse effects.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Our distribution operations are currently concentrated in a single, company-owned distribution center in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Any significant disruption in the operation of the facility due to natural disaster or severe weather, or events such as fire, accidents, power outages, system failures, or other unforeseen causes, could devalue or damage a significant portion of our inventory and could adversely affect our product distribution and sales until such time as we could secure an alternative facility.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P16_S4	If we encounter difficulties with our distribution facility or other problems or disasters arise, we cannot ensure that critical systems and operations will be restored in a timely manner or at all, and this would have a material adverse effect on our business.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P16_S5	In addition, our growth could require us to further expand our current facility, which could affect us adversely in ways that we cannot predict.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P16_S6	The cost of raw materials could increase our cost of sales and cause our results of operations to suffer.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Fluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of fabrics or other raw materials used to manufacture our products, as well as the price for labor, marketing, and transportation, could have adverse impacts on our cost of sales and our ability to meet our customers demands.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P16_S8	In particular, fluctuations in the price of cotton, our primary raw material, could have an adverse impact on our cost of sales.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P16_S9	In addition, because a key component of our products is petroleum-based, the cost of oil affects the cost of our products.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P16_S10	Upward movement in the price of oil in the global oil markets would also likely result in rising fuel and freight prices, which could increase our shipping costs.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P16_S11	In the future, we may not be able to pass all or a portion of higher costs on to our customers.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P16_S12	Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing and manufacturing activities.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P16_S13	We source our fabrics primarily from manufacturers in China and South Korea and outsource the production of a significant majority of our products to companies in Asia.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P16_S14	We are subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing and manufacturing, including, but not limited to:
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	natural disasters, acts of war and terrorism, changing macroeconomic trends, and other external factors over which we have no control.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Additionally, we do not have complete oversight over our contract manufacturers.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Violation of labor or other laws by those manufacturers, or the divergence of a contract manufacturer s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States or in other markets in which we may in the future do business, could also draw negative publicity for us and our brand, diminishing the value of our brand and reducing demand for our products.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our ability to source our products at favorable prices, or at all, could be harmed, with adverse effects on our results of operations, if new trade restrictions are imposed or if existing trade restrictions become more burdensome.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A significant majority of our products are currently manufactured for us in Asia.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The United States and the countries in which our products are produced have imposed and may impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or regulations or may adversely adjust prevailing quotas, duties, or tariffs.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Countries impose, modify, and remove tariffs and other trade restrictions in response to a diverse array of factors, including global and national economic and political conditions, which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other trade restrictions.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Trade restrictions, which include embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us or could require us to modify supply chain organization or other current business practices, any of which could harm our results of operations.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Currently, none of our employees are represented by a union.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Nevertheless, our employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to organize or affiliate with a union.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P20_S6	If some or all of our workforce were to become unionized, our business would be exposed to work stoppages and slowdowns as a unionized business.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P20_S7	If, in addition, the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly more favorable to union workers than our current pay-and-benefits arrangements, our costs would increase and our results of operations would suffer.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P20_S8	We rely on independent transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We currently rely on independent transportation service providers for substantially all of our product shipments.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our utilization of these delivery services, or those of any other shipping companies that we may elect to use, is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, employee strikes and inclement weather, which may impact the shipping company s ability to provide delivery services sufficient to meet our shipping needs.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If for any reason we were to change shipping companies, we could face logistical difficulties that might adversely affect deliveries, and we would incur costs and expend resources in the course of making the change.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Moreover, we might not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from the service providers that we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P21_S4	We also would face shipping and distribution risks and uncertainties associated with any expansion of our distribution facility and related systems.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We face various risks as an e-commerce retailer.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Business risks relating to e-commerce sales include the need to keep pace with rapid technological change, internet security risks, risks of system failure or inadequacy, governmental regulation, and taxation.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We have contracted with several different companies to maintain and operate various aspects of our e-commerce business and are reliant on them and their ability to perform their tasks, as well as their operational, privacy, and security procedures and controls as they affect our business.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If the independent contractors on which we rely fail to perform their tasks, we could incur liability or suffer damages to our reputation, or both.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Our copyrights, trademarks and other proprietary rights could conflict with the rights of others, and we may be inhibited from selling some of our products.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P22_S5	If we are unable to protect our copyrights and other proprietary rights, others may sell imitation brand products.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P22_S6	We believe that our registered copyrights, registered and common law trademarks, and other proprietary rights have significant value and are critical to our ability to create and sustain demand for our products.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Although we have not been inhibited from selling our products in connection with intellectual property disputes, we cannot assure you that obstacles will not arise as we expand our product line and extend our brand as well as the geographic scope of our sales and marketing.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P22_S8	We also cannot assure you that the actions taken by us to establish and protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products or infringement of our rights by others.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P22_S9	The legal regimes of some foreign countries, particularly China, may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by others in these countries.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P22_S10	The loss of copyrights, trademarks, and other proprietary rights could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P22_S11	Any litigation regarding our proprietary rights could be time consuming and costly.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Prior to the completion of the Reorganization, we were treated as an S Corporation under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code, and claims of taxing authorities related to our prior status as an S Corporation could harm us.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Upon the completion of the Reorganization in fiscal 2011, our S Corporation status terminated automatically and we became subject to increased federal and state income taxes.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If the unaudited, open tax years in which we were an S Corporation are audited by the Internal Revenue Service, and we are determined not to have qualified for, or to have violated, our S Corporation status, we will be obligated to pay back taxes, interest, and penalties, and we do not have the right to reclaim tax distributions we have made to our shareholders during those periods.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	These amounts could include taxes on all of our taxable income while we were an S Corporation.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Any such claims could result in additional costs to us and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results and stock price.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We are subject to income taxes in many U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which includes reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Further, possible changes in federal, state, local, and non-U.S. tax laws bearing upon our revenues, income, property, or other aspects of our operations or business would, if enacted, affect our results of operations in ways and to a degree that we cannot currently predict.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Additional indebtedness may decrease business flexibility and increase borrowing costs.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	As of February 1, 2014, we had no outstanding borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement, compared to $15.0 million outstanding under our former credit facility as of February 2, 2013.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Future indebtedness, if any, could have the effect, among other things, of:
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to companies that have less debt.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We plan to use cash provided by operating activities to fund our expanding business and execute our growth strategies and may require additional capital, which may not be available to us.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Our business relies on cash provided by operating activities as our primary source of liquidity.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P27_S3	To support our growing business and execute our growth strategies, we will need significant amounts of cash from that source.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P27_S4	If our business does not generate cash flow from operating activities sufficient to fund these activities, and if sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from our existing revolving credit facility, we will need to seek additional capital, through debt or equity financings, to fund our growth.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P27_S5	If new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, then we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would inhibit our growth and could harm our business.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P27_S6	Our Indirect business could suffer as a result of bankruptcies or operational or financial difficulties of our Indirect retailers.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P27_S7	We do not enter into long-term agreements with any of our Indirect retailers.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P27_S8	Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers for each of our lines every season.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P27_S9	A decision by a significant number of Indirect retailers, whether motivated by competitive conditions, operational or financial difficulties, reduced access to capital, or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or to change their manner of doing business with us could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P27_S10	Although we recommend retail sale prices for our products to our Indirect retailers, we do not provide dealer allowances or other economic incentives to support those prices.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P27_S11	Possible promotional pricing or discounting by Indirect retailers in response to softening retail demand could have a negative effect on our brand image and prestige, which might be difficult to counteract as the economy improves.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We sell our Indirect merchandise primarily to specialty retail stores across the United States and extend trade credit based on an evaluation of each Indirect retailer s financial condition, usually without requiring collateral.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Perceived financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Pending the resolution of a relationship with a financially troubled Indirect retailer, we might assume credit risk that we would otherwise avoid relating to our receivables from that customer.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Inability to collect on accounts receivable from our Indirect retailers would adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	There are claims made against us from time to time that can result in litigation or regulatory proceedings, which could distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability or damage to our brand image.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	As a growing company with expanding operations, we increasingly face the risk of litigation and other claims against us.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Litigation and other claims may arise in the ordinary course of our business and include employee claims, custom and duty claims, commercial disputes, intellectual property issues, product-oriented allegations, and slip and fall claims.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Often these cases raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Litigation and other claims against us could result in unexpected expenses and liability, as well as materially adversely affect our operations and our reputation.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Health care reform could adversely affect the Company s business.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P30_S6	In 2010, Congress enacted comprehensive health care reform legislation which, among other things, includes guaranteed coverage requirements, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits, restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded, and imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P30_S7	Due to the breadth and complexity of the health reform legislation, the current lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, and the phased-in nature of the implementation, it is difficult to predict the overall effect of the legislation and related regulations on the business over the coming years.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P30_S8	Possible adverse effects of the health reform legislation include increased costs, exposure to expanded liability and requirements for the Company to revise ways in which it conducts business.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P30_S9	Risks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock Our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell shares at or above the price at which you purchase them.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P30_S10	The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	These and other factors may result in a lower market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	As a result, our common stock may trade at prices significantly below the offering price.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	In addition, the stock markets, including The Nasdaq Global Select Market, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many retail companies.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P31_S4	If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Because a limited number of shareholders control a large percentage of the voting power of our common stock, investors may have limited ability to determine the outcome of shareholder votes.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Michael Ray (former CEO and Ms. Bradley Baekgaard's son in-law), Robert Hall, Barbara Bradley Baekgaard, Joan Hall (Mr. Hall s wife and Ms. Bradley Baekgaard s daughter), Patricia R. Miller and P. Michael Miller, directly or indirectly, beneficially own and have the ability to exercise voting control over, in the aggregate, 43.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	As a result, these shareholders are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, any amendments to our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and significant corporate transactions.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P32_S3	This concentrated ownership of outstanding common stock may limit your ability to influence corporate matters, and the interests of these shareholders may not coincide with our interests or your interests.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P32_S4	As a result, we may take actions that you do not believe to be in our interests or your interests and that could depress our stock price.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P32_S5	In addition, this significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock should investors perceive disadvantages in owning shares of common stock in a company that has such concentrated ownership.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	From time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management s estimates as of the date of release.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in the release.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed, but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P34_S3	We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data are forecast.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P35_S4	In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Indiana law may discourage or prevent a change in control, even if a sale of the company would be beneficial to our shareholders, which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by shareholders to replace or remove our current management.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control, discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock, harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	requiring advance notice for raising business matters or nominating directors at shareholders meetings.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	As permitted by our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, our board of directors also has the ability, should they so determine, to adopt a shareholder rights agreement, sometimes called a poison pill, providing for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common stock.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	In the event of a takeover attempt, this preferred stock would give rights to holders of common stock (other than the potential acquirer) to buy additional shares of common stock at a discount, leading to the dilution of the potential acquirer s stake.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The adoption of a poison pill, or the board s ability to do so, can have negative effects such as those described above.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	As an Indiana corporation, we are governed by the Indiana Business Corporation Law (as amended from time to time, the IBCL ).
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Under specified circumstances, certain provisions of the IBCL related to control share acquisitions, business combinations and constituent interests may delay, prevent or make more difficult unsolicited acquisitions or changes of control of us.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P40_S2	These provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our management.
1495320_14_ITEM1A_P40_S3	It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that shareholders might deem to be in their best interest.
1495320_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	This property is owned by Milburn, LLC, a leasing company in which Barbara Bradley Baekgaard owns a 50% interest and Patricia R. Miller and P. Michael Miller each own a 25% interest.
1495320_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, of this report for additional information regarding this property.
1495320_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	This property was purchased from Great Dane Realty, LLC, a company owned by Barbara Bradley Baekgaard, in December 2013.
1495320_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, of this report for additional information regarding this property.
1495320_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	The 200,000 square-foot expansion of the distribution facility was completed in fiscal 2013.
1495320_14_ITEM2_P2_S1	As of February 1, 2014 , we also leased 105 store locations in the United States, including 6 store locations opened or to be opened in fiscal 2015.
1495320_14_ITEM2_P2_S2	See below for more information regarding the locations of our open stores as of February 1, 2014 .
1495320_14_ITEM2_P3_S0	We consider these properties to be in good condition generally and believe that our facilities are adequate for our operations and provide sufficient capacity to meet our anticipated requirements.
1495320_14_ITEM2_P3_S1	The properties in the above table are used by both the Direct segment and Indirect segment, excluding the two showrooms which are used exclusively by the Indirect segment.
1495320_14_ITEM2_P4_S0	Our full-price stores are located primarily in high-traffic regional malls, lifestyle centers, and mixed-use shopping centers across the United States.
1495320_14_ITEM2_P4_S1	The following table shows the number of full-price and outlet stores we operated in each state as of February 1, 2014 :
1495320_14_ITEM2_P5_S0	We lease all of our stores.
1495320_14_ITEM2_P5_S1	Lease terms generally range from five to ten years with options to renew for varying terms.
1495320_14_ITEM2_P5_S2	The leases generally provide for a fixed minimum rental plus contingent rent, which is determined as a percentage of sales in excess of specified levels.
1495320_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol VRA .
1495320_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices of our common stock, as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market, for each quarterly period in our two most recent fiscal years:
1495320_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of March 25, 2014, we had approximately 25 registered shareholders of record.
1495320_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	The number of shareholders of record is based upon the actual number of shareholders registered at such date and does not include holders of shares in street names or persons, partnerships, associations, corporations, or other entities identified in security position listings maintained by depositories.
1495320_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	Dividends Our common stock began trading on October 21, 2010, following our initial public offering.
1495320_14_ITEM5_P2_S1	Since that time, we have not declared any cash dividends, and we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

1495320_14_ITEM5_P3_S1	Additional amounts were distributed from time to time to our shareholders at the discretion of the board of directors.
1495320_14_ITEM5_P3_S2	During fiscal 2011, we paid distributions of $132.8 million to our shareholders, which included a final distribution (resulting from the termination of our S Corporation status) of 100% of our undistributed taxable income from the date of our formation through October 2, 2010.

1495320_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	Executive summary Below is a summary of our strategic progress and financial highlights:
1495320_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	We successfully opened 23 new full-price and outlet stores during the year in both current and underpenetrated markets.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	Over 69 million people visited verabradley.com, an 11% increase over the prior year.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	We consistently rank among the top in number of annual website visits compared to our most closely related peer companies.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	In August, we announced the expansion of our current design and distribution centers, both of which are located just outside of Fort Wayne, Indiana, to create a company campus for the majority of our office personnel increasing efficiency and ease of collaboration.

1495320_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	How We Assess the Performance of Our Business In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Net Revenues Net revenues reflect revenues from the sale of our merchandise and from distribution and shipping and handling fees, less returns and discounts.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	Revenues for the Direct segment reflect sales through our full-price and outlet stores, department store locations in Japan, our websites, verabradley.com and verabradley.co.jp, and our annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	Revenues for the Indirect segment reflect sales to Indirect specialty retailers and department stores.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P8_S3	Comparable-Store Sales Comparable-store sales are calculated based upon our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the reporting period.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P8_S4	Remodeled stores are included in comparable-store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales differently than we do.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	As a result, data in this report regarding our comparable-store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other companies.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	Comparable store sales do not include e-commerce sales.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Measuring the change in year-over-year comparable-store sales allows us to evaluate how our store base is performing.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Various factors affect our comparable-store sales, including:
1495320_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	The timing and success of promotional and advertising efforts.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	Gross Profit Gross profit is equal to our net revenues less our cost of sales.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Cost of sales includes the direct cost of purchased and manufactured merchandise, distribution center costs, operations overhead, duty, and all inbound freight costs incurred.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	The components of our reported cost of sales may not be comparable to those of other retail and wholesale companies.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Gross profit can be impacted by changes in volume, fluctuations in sales price, operational efficiencies, such as leveraging of fixed costs, promotional activities, such as free shipping, and commodity prices such as cotton, and labor in Asia.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (SG A) SG A expenses include selling; advertising, marketing, and product development; and administrative.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	Selling expenses include Direct business expenses such as store expenses, employee compensation, and store occupancy and supply costs, as well as Indirect business expenses consisting primarily of employee compensation and other expenses associated with sales to Indirect retailers.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	Advertising, marketing, and product development expenses include employee compensation, media costs, creative production expenses, marketing agency fees, new product design costs, public relations expenses, and market research expenses.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P14_S3	A portion of our advertising expenses may be reimbursed by Indirect retailers, and such amount is classified as other income.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P14_S4	Administrative expenses include employee compensation for corporate functions, corporate headquarters occupancy costs, consulting and software expenses, and charitable donations.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Other Income We support many of our Indirect retailers marketing efforts by distributing certain catalogs and promotional mailers to current and prospective customers.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	Our Indirect retailers reimburse us for a portion of the cost to produce these materials.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	Reimbursement received is recorded as other income.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P15_S3	The related cost to design, produce, and distribute the catalogs and mailers is recorded as SG A expense.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P15_S4	Other income also includes proceeds from the sales of tickets to our annual outlet sale and the gain on the sale of certain life insurance policies.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P15_S5	Operating Income Operating income equals gross profit less SG A expenses plus other income.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P15_S6	Operating income excludes interest income, interest expense, and income taxes.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	The following tables summarize key components of our consolidated results of operations for the last three fiscal years, both in dollars and as a percentage of our net revenues.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	The Company utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	As such, fiscal year 2014 ended on February 1, 2014 and reflected a 52-week period; fiscal year 2013 ended on February 2, 2013 and reflected a 53-week period; fiscal year 2012 ended on January 28, 2012 and reflected a 52-week period.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P16_S3	The inclusion of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2013 resulted in incremental net revenues of approximately $4.9 million and approximately $0.02 per diluted share.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	The following tables present net revenues by operating segment, both in dollars and as a percentage of our net revenues, and full-price and outlet store data for the last three fiscal years:
1495320_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	(2) Includes full-price and outlet stores.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	(3) Comparable-store sales are the net revenues of our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the period.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	Increase or decrease is reported as a percentage change of the comparable-store sales for the same period in the prior fiscal year.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	Remodeled stores are included in comparable-store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P18_S4	Comparable store sales do not include e-commerce sales.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P18_S5	Calculation excludes sales for the 53 rd week in fiscal 2013.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	Average net revenues per gross square foot are calculated by dividing total net revenues for our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the period by total gross square footage for those stores.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Net Revenues For fiscal 2014 , net revenues decreased $5.1 million, or 0.9%, to $536.0 million, from $541.1 million for fiscal 2013 , primarily due to an additional 7 days included in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2014, which added net revenues of $4.9 million and decreased volume.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	For fiscal 2014 , net revenues increased $33.7 million, or 11.5%, to $326.2 million, from $292.6 million for fiscal 2013 .
1495320_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	This growth resulted primarily from a $31.0 million increase in revenues at our stores due to 23 additional full-price and outlet stores which is offset by a comparable-store sales decrease of $8.4 million, or 5.7%.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P20_S3	The decreases in comparable store and e-commerce sales related to year-over-year declines in traffic, a lower average transaction size, and underperformance of the product offering.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P20_S4	The number of our stores grew from 76 at the end of fiscal 2013 to 99 at the end of fiscal 2014 .
1495320_14_ITEM7_P20_S5	For fiscal 2014 , net revenues decreased $38.8 million, or 15.6%, to $209.8 million, from $248.6 million for fiscal 2013 , primarily due to lower orders from the Company s specialty retailers combined with closing approximately 400 wholesale accounts during the year, through a combination of remediation, natural attrition, and a more selective approach to opening new specialty gift stores.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	Gross Profit For fiscal 2014 , gross profit decreased $12.8 million, or 4.2%, to $295.4 million, from $308.3 million for fiscal 2013 .
1495320_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	As a percentage of net revenues, gross profit decreased to 55.1% for fiscal 2014, from 57.0% for fiscal 2013 .
1495320_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a $4.8 million i nventory write-down, increased year-over-year promotional activity, as well as the sales mix of lower-margin product.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P21_S3	For fiscal 2014 , SG A expenses increased $1.5 million, or 0.8%, to $206.0 million, from $204.4 million for fiscal 2013 .
1495320_14_ITEM7_P21_S4	As a percentage of net revenues, SG A expenses were 38.4% and 37.8% for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 , respectively.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P21_S5	The increase in SG A expenses as a percent of net revenues was primarily due to fixed expenses being spread over lower revenues in the Indirect segment, the deleveraging of store operating expenses, and the impact of employee-related expenses from headcount added in the first half of fiscal 2014, partially offset by reductions in variable compensation expense associated with Company performance.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P21_S6	Other Income For fiscal 2014 , other income decreased $1.5 million, or 23.9%, to $4.8 million, from $6.3 million for fiscal 2013 .
1495320_14_ITEM7_P21_S7	The decrease in other income was in line with a decrease in associated advertising costs related to mailers for our specialty retailers.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P21_S8	Operating Income For fiscal 2014 , operating income decreased $15.9 million, or 14.4%, to $94.3 million, from $110.1 million for fiscal 2013 .
1495320_14_ITEM7_P21_S9	As a percentage of net revenues, operating income was 17.6% and 20.4% for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 , respectively.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P21_S10	The following table provides additional information about our operating income (in thousands).
1495320_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	For fiscal 2014 , operating income decreased $5.2 million, or 6.1%.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	As a percentage of Direct segment net revenues, operating income in the Direct segment was 24.5% and 29.1% for fiscal 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	This decrease as a percentage of net revenues in the Direct segment was primarily due to sales of lower-margin product accounting for a higher percentage of total segment revenue, as well as increased promotional activity.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	For fiscal 2014 , operating income decreased $16.9 million, or 16.8%.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P22_S4	As a percentage of Indirect segment net revenues, operating income in the Indirect segment was 40.1% and 40.7% for fiscal 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P22_S5	This decrease as a percentage of net revenues in the Indirect segment resulted primarily from deleveraging of the relatively fixed SG A expenses against sales declines.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P22_S6	For fiscal 2014 , unallocated expenses decreased $6.2 million, or 8.2%, primarily as a result of discretionary spending cuts and reductions in variable compensation expense associated with the Company s financial performance.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P22_S7	For fiscal 2014 , net interest expense decreased $0.3 million, or 43.7%, to $0.4 million, from $0.7 million in fiscal 2013 .
1495320_14_ITEM7_P22_S8	The decrease was due to lower average borrowing levels in fiscal 2014 .
1495320_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	For fiscal 2014 , we recorded income tax expense of $35.1 million at an effective tax rate of 37.3%, compared to 37.1% for fiscal year 2013 .
1495320_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Net Revenues For fiscal 2013, net revenues increased $80.3 million, or 17.4%, to $541.1 million, from $460.8 million for fiscal 2012, primarily due to increased volume and an additional 7 days included in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, which added net revenues of $4.9 million.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	For fiscal 2013, net revenues increased $67.3 million, or 29.9%, to $292.6 million, from $225.3 million for fiscal 2012.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	This growth resulted primarily from a $44.8 million increase in revenues related to additional full-price and outlet stores; a comparable-store sales increase of $3.4 million, or 3.4%, primarily driven by the improved performance of the product assortment and various in-store events to drive traffic; and an $18.9 million increase in e-commerce revenues due to the continued growth in website traffic.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	The number of our stores grew from 56 at the end of fiscal 2012 to 76 at the end of fiscal 2013.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P24_S4	For fiscal 2013, net revenues increased $13.0 million, or 5.5%, to $248.6 million, from $235.6 million for fiscal 2012, due to growth in the number of department store locations and increased sales volume to our specialty retailers.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P24_S5	Gross Profit For fiscal 2013, gross profit increased $50.7 million, or 19.7%, to $308.3 million, from $257.6 million for fiscal 2012.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P24_S6	As a percentage of net revenues, gross profit increased to 57.0% for fiscal 2013, from 55.9% for fiscal 2012.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P24_S7	The increase in gross margin was due primarily to operational efficiencies, lower freight expense, positive channel mix, and lower input costs.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P24_S8	For fiscal 2013, SG A expenses increased $35.0 million, or 20.6%, to $204.4 million, from $169.4 million for fiscal 2012.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P24_S9	As a percentage of net revenues, SG A expenses were 37.8% and 36.8% for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P24_S10	The increase as a percentage of net revenues in SG A expenses was due primarily to increased headcount expenses and increased store operating expenses.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P24_S11	Other Income For fiscal 2013, other income decreased $1.7 million, or 21.3%, to $6.3 million, from $8.0 million for fiscal 2012.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P24_S12	The decrease in other income was in line with a decrease in associated advertising costs related to mailers for our specialty retailers.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P24_S13	Operating Income For fiscal 2013, operating income increased $14.0 million, or 14.5%, to $110.1 million, from $96.2 million for fiscal 2012.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P24_S14	As a percentage of net revenues, operating income was 20.4% and 20.9% for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively (in thousands).
1495320_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	For fiscal 2013, operating income increased $17.0 million, or 24.9%.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	As a percentage of Direct segment net revenues, operating income in the Direct segment was 29.1% and 30.2% for fiscals 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	This decrease as a percentage of net revenues in the Direct segment was primarily due to increased store operating expense.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	For fiscal 2013, operating income increased $8.0 million, or 8.6%.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P25_S4	As a percentage of Indirect segment net revenues, operating income in the Indirect segment was 40.7% and 39.5% for fiscals 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P25_S5	This increase as a percentage of net revenues in the Indirect segment resulted primarily due to leverage of the relatively fixed SG A expenses, against sales growth.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	For fiscal 2013, unallocated expenses increased $11.0 million, or 16.9%, primarily as a result of increased corporate personnel and marketing costs.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	For fiscal 2013, net interest expense decreased $0.5 million, or 40.8%, to $0.7 million, from $1.1 million in fiscal 2012.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	The decrease was due to lower average borrowing levels in fiscal 2013.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	For fiscal 2013, we recorded income tax expense of $40.6 million at an effective tax rate of 37.1%, compared to 39.0% for fiscal year 2012.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	The effective tax rate reduction was primarily related to state income tax credits associated with the completion of our distribution center expansion and discrete items recorded primarily during the third quarter.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	The impact of these items on the effective tax rate was approximately 1.2% for the fiscal year.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P27_S3	During fiscal 2012, there were other permanent items that caused a higher rate which did not recur during fiscal 2013 causing the rate to decrease approximately 0.5% compared to the prior year.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P27_S4	The effective tax rate also reflects a loss for the Japanese operations for which a tax benefit was not recognized.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	We also have access to additional liquidity, if needed, through borrowings under our $125.0 million amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	Historically, our primary cash needs have been for purchasing inventories, payroll, store rent, capital expenditures associated with opening new stores, buildings, operational equipment, information technology, and debt repayments.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	The most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, purchasing inventories, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current liabilities.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	We do not believe that the expansion of our Direct business will materially increase borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement, in the near term.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P29_S3	We believe that cash flows from operating activities and the availability of borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement or other financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P29_S4	Cash Flow Analysis A summary of operating, investing, and financing activities is shown in the following table (in thousands):
1495320_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation, the effect of changes in assets and liabilities, and tenant-improvement allowances received from landlords under our store leases.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $87.9 million during fiscal 2014 , as compared to $51.5 million during fiscal 2013.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	This increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by a net working capital increase of $44.5 million, as a result of a reduced inventory build of $19.4 million along with an increase in accounts payable of $25.3 million.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P30_S3	This increase was partially offset by a decrease in net income of $10.1 million.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P30_S4	Net cash provided by operating activities was $51.5 million in fiscal 2013.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P30_S5	Net income increased $10.9 million, non-cash changes in balances increased $12.8 million, and income taxes payable provided an incremental increase of $13.7 million, offset by working capital changes including an incremental inventory build of $24.6 million and an incremental reduction in accounts payable of $12.4 million.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P30_S6	Net cash provided by operating activities was $51.5 million for fiscal 2012 which was primarily driven by our net income during the year.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for growth related to new store openings, buildings, operational equipment, and information technology investments.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Net cash used in investing activities was $22.9 million in fiscal 2014 , compared to $35.9 million in fiscal 2013 .
1495320_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	The $13.0 million decrease in capital expenditures was driven primarily by the expansion of the distribution facility which occurred in fiscal 2013, partially offset by the cost associated with opening of three additional stores during fiscal 2014.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	Net cash used in investing activities was $35.9 million in fiscal 2013 , compared to $18.8 million in fiscal 2012 .
1495320_14_ITEM7_P32_S3	The $17.1 million increase in capital expenditures was driven primarily by the expansion of the distribution facility.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P32_S4	Capital expenditures for fiscal 2015 are expected to be approximately $40 million, including the corporate campus expansion, build-out of new stores, and continued investment in our systems, including the e-commerce platform.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P32_S5	Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $15.3 million in fiscal 2014 , primarily resulting from $15.0 million net payments under our amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P32_S6	Net cash used in financing activities was $10.8 million in fiscal 2013 , resulting from $10.0 million net payments under our amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P32_S7	Net cash used in financing activities was $41.8 million in fiscal 2012 , resulting from the net payments under our amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On October 4, 2010, Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. entered into an agreement to amend and restate our credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, as administrative agent, and certain other lenders.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	The amended and restated credit agreement provides for a revolving credit commitment of $125.0 million and was to mature on October 3, 2015.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	On June 1, 2012, Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. entered into an amendment to the credit agreement.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	The amendment extends the maturity date from October 3, 2015 to June 1, 2017.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	Certain permitted indebtedness covenants were also amended.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P34_S3	All borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of Vera Bradley Design, Inc.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P34_S4	The credit agreement is also guaranteed by the Company.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P34_S5	The credit agreement requires us to comply with various financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.20 to 1.00 and a leverage ratio of not more than 3.50 to 1.00.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P34_S6	The agreement also contains various other covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of certain indebtedness, liens, investments, acquisitions, and asset sales.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P34_S7	We were in compliance with these covenants as of February 1, 2014 .
1495320_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement bear interest at either LIBOR plus the applicable margin (ranging from 1.05% to 2.05%) or the alternate base rate (as defined in the agreement) plus the applicable margin (ranging from 0.05% to 1.05%).
1495320_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	The applicable margin is tied to our leverage ratio.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	In addition, we are required to pay a quarterly facility fee (as defined in the agreement) ranging from 0.20% to 0.45% of the revolving credit commitment.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P35_S3	We had borrowing availability of $125.0 million under the agreement as of February 1, 2014.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	We enter into long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily non-cancellable operating leases and debt obligations.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	As of February 1, 2014 , our contractual cash obligations over the next several periods are as follows:
1495320_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	(1) Our store leases generally range from five to ten years with varying renewal options.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	Our future operating lease obligations would change if we were to extend these leases, or if we were to enter into new operating leases.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	(2) Purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	(3) Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our uncertain tax positions at February 1, 2014 , we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	Therefore, $3.1 million of uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosures relating to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	We evaluate our accounting policies, estimates, and judgments on an on-going basis.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P40_S4	We evaluate the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and believe that the following policies and estimates involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position, and are therefore discussed as critical.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	The following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent results of operations.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	Our historical results for the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, however, have not been materially impacted by such variances.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	More information on all of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from the sale of our products is recognized upon customer receipt of the product when collection of the associated receivables is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and ownership and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, which, for e-commerce and most Indirect sales, reflects an estimate of shipments that customers have not yet received.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	The adjustment of these shipments is based on actual delivery dates to the customer.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	Significant changes in shipping terms or delivery times could materially impact our revenues in a given period.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	We reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	In the Direct business returns are refunded by issuing the same payment tender of the original purchase and in the Indirect business the customer is issued a credit to its account to apply to outstanding invoices.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Merchandise exchanges of the same product at the same price are not considered merchandise returns.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	Product returns are often resalable through our annual outlet sale or other channels.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	Additionally, we reserve for other potential product credits and for customer shipments not yet received.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	The total reserve for returns, customer shipments not yet received, and general credits was $3.7 million and $4.1 million at February 1, 2014 , and February 2, 2013 , respectively.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P46_S2	Market is determined based on net realizable value, which includes costs to dispose.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P46_S3	Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excess quantities, and other factors, including the popularity of a pattern or product, in evaluating net realizable value.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	We record valuation adjustments to our inventories, which are reflected in cost of sales, if the cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	This adjustment calculation requires us to make assumptions and estimates, which are based on factors such as merchandise seasonality, historical trends, and estimated sales and inventory levels, including sell-through of remaining units.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	In addition, as part of inventory adjustments, we provide for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from our physical inventory counts.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P47_S3	We perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrink provision accordingly.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P47_S4	Inventory adjustments of $8.9 million and $3.5 million were recorded for these matters as of the fiscal years ended February 1, 2014 , and February 2, 2013 , respectively.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P47_S5	These adjustments related primarily to raw materials of retired patterns and certain merchandise from the baby gift category, which is being discontinued by the Company, as we have the ability to move retired finished goods through a number of channels, including the annual outlet sale, our website and outlet stores, and through liquidators as needed.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is based on our pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained; (2) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	We believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	Taxing authorities, however, may take a contrary position.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P49_S3	Our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if, upon final resolution with taxing authorities, we prevail in positions for which we have established reserves, or are required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Valuation of Long-lived Assets Property, plant, and equipment assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	In evaluating an asset for recoverability, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset at the store level, the lowest identifiable level of cash flow, if applicable.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset is less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, usually determined by an estimated discounted cash flow analysis of the asset.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	Factors used in the valuation of long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, our plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results, and projected future cash flows.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	With respect to our stores, we analyze store economics, location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies in our selection process.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	Impairment charges are classified in SG A expenses and were $1.2 million and $0.2 million for the periods ended February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013, respectively.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	The discounted cash flow models used to estimate the applicable fair values involve numerous estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	Changes to these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the fair value estimates.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P55_S2	The estimates and assumptions critical to the overall fair value estimates include: (1) estimated future cash flow generated at the store level; and (2) discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair values.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P55_S3	These and other estimates and assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and our expectations and may change in the future based on period-specific facts and circumstances.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P55_S4	If economic conditions were to deteriorate, future impairment charges may be required.
1495320_14_ITEM7_P55_S5	Transactions with Related Parties See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, of this report for information regarding transactions with related parties.
1495320_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement, which bear interest at variable rates.
1495320_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The amended and restated credit agreement allows for a revolving credit commitment of $125.0 million, bearing interest at a variable rate, based on either LIBOR plus the applicable margin (ranging from 1.05% to 2.05%) or the alternate base rate (as defined in the agreement) plus the applicable margin (ranging from 0.05% to 1.05%).
1495320_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Assuming the amended and restated credit agreement is fully drawn, each quarter point increase or decrease in the interest rate would change our annual interest expense by approximately $0.3 million.
1495320_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Impact of Inflation Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost.
1495320_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Although it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial.
1495320_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We source a majority of our materials from various suppliers in China and South Korea.
1495320_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Substantially all purchases and sales involving foreign persons are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore we do not hedge using any derivative instruments.
1495320_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Historically, we have not been impacted materially by changes in exchange rates.

1495320_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	Description of the Company Vera Bradley is a leading designer, producer, marketer, and retailer of stylish, highly functional accessories for women.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P11_S1	The Company s products include a wide offering of handbags, accessories, and travel and leisure items.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P11_S2	The Company generates net revenues by selling products through two reportable segments: Direct and Indirect.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P11_S3	The Direct segment consists of sales of Vera Bradley products through our 84 full-price stores, our 15 outlet stores in the United States, 13 department store locations in Japan, our websites, verabradley.com and verabradley.co.jp, and our annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P11_S4	The Indirect business consists of sales of Vera Bradley products to approximately 3,100 specialty retailers, substantially all of which are located in the United States, as well as select department stores and third-party e-commerce sites.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	Except where context requires or where otherwise indicated, the terms Vera Bradley and Company refer to Vera Bradley, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Vera Bradley Designs, Inc.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P13_S1	The Company has eliminated intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P13_S2	The Company utilizes a 52 - 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P13_S3	As such, fiscal 2014 ended on February 1, 2014 and reflected a 52 -week period; fiscal 2013 and 2012 ended on February 2, 2013 , and January 28, 2012 , and reflected 53 -week and 52 -week periods, respectively.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P13_S4	The inclusion of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2013 resulted in incremental revenues of approximately $4.9 million and approximately $0.02 per diluted share.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the Company s assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosures relating to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P14_S1	Significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include the valuation of inventories, accounts receivable valuation allowances, sales return allowances, and the useful lives of assets for depreciation or amortization.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P14_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P14_S3	The Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents represent cash on hand, deposits with financial institutions, and investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	Concentration of Credit Risk The Company maintains nearly all of its cash and cash equivalents with one financial institution.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P15_S2	The Company monitors the credit standing of this financial institution on a regular basis.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P16_S1	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P16_S2	Market is determined based on net realizable value, which includes costs to dispose.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P16_S3	Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excess quantities, and other factors, including the popularity of a pattern or product, in evaluating net realizable value.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are carried at cost and depreciated or amortized over the following estimated useful lives using the straight-line method:
1495320_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the asset or the lease term.
1495320_14_ITEM8_P18_S1	Lease terms typically range from five to ten years.

1495320_15_ITEM1_P24_S3	To keep our assortment current and fresh, and to focus our inventory investments on our best performers, we discontinue patterns at regular intervals.

1495320_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	understanding of the needs of our target customers, with knowledge of upcoming color and fashion trends, to design new collections, as well as new product categories, that will resonate in the market.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	We typically begin the development stage of our products in the Vera Bradley portfolio twelve to eighteen months in advance of their release.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P32_S2	The development of each new pattern includes the design of an overall print, a complementary fabric backing, and coordinating trim materials.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P32_S3	To seek fresh perspectives, we collaborate with independent designers to create unique patterns for each season.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P32_S4	We oversee the development and exercise the final approval of all patterns and designs.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P32_S5	Once developed, we generally copyright each pattern, including the print, fabric backing and coordinating trim.

1495320_15_ITEM1_P32_S7	In the past several years, we have made investments to evolve and integrate our product development expertise, including opening a design office in New York City, as well as opening a design center in Roanoke, Indiana.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P32_S8	Our product development team works to ensure that new collections contain an assortment of products and styles that are in line with both fashion trends and customer needs and regularly updates classic styles to enhance functionality.

1495320_15_ITEM1_P32_S15	Marketing We believe that the growth of our brand and our business is influenced by our ability to introduce and sell our merchandise in a way that clearly conveys the Vera Bradley brand personality.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P32_S16	We use marketing as a critical tool in our efforts to promote our brand.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	Vera Bradley communicates with our established customers consistently throughout the year with daily e-mails and seasonal direct mail catalogs, brochures and notifications.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	Our retention advertising is geared to keeping Vera Bradley top of mind with our customers, rewarding our customers, and providing them with news of our seasonal launches and new product introductions.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	We primarily employ print and digital (i.e., display banner, mobile, geo-targeting, and pre-roll video) advertising to increase overall brand awareness and attract new customers.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P33_S3	Our advertisements are placed in fashion, lifestyle, family, and teen publications and websites that compliment the wide breadth of appeal of our brand.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P33_S4	Our ads have recently appeared in Vogue, Elle, Seventeen, Teen Vogue, InStyle, Better Homes and Gardens, Parents, and Real Simple .
1495320_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	The seasonal Vera Bradley catalogs are key vehicles for promoting the brand and product portfolio.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	Each catalog is sent to a targeted customer mailing list.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	In addition to distributing the catalog, we produce and distribute a number of other marketing pieces, including postcards and mini-mailers.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P34_S3	We believe our direct mail medium generates excitement and awareness about the brand and seasonal introductions and allows us to reach both new and loyal customers in their homes.

1495320_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	Online marketing and social networking sites are tools to increase brand awareness and drive traffic to verabradley.com and to our stores.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	We have captured more than 3.4 million customer e-mail addresses in our online customer file, with many of these customers providing age, occupation, and location data.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P37_S2	This captured information provides us with deeper insight into the products and categories that are in the highest interest of our customers, and allows us to better target our customers with appropriate messages.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P37_S3	As of January 31, 2015 , we had approximately 1.6 million Facebook fans and over 74,000 Twitter followers.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P37_S4	Our Instagram, which we launched in October 2012, has grown to more than 100,000 followers and is our most highly engaged social medium.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	Seasonality Because Vera Bradley products are frequently given as gifts, we have historically realized, and expect to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of November and December.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	Channels of Distribution We distribute our products through our Direct and Indirect segments.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	This multi-channel distribution model is designed to enable operational flexibility and maximizes the methods by which we can access potential customers.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P39_S2	We have developed a retail presence through our full-line stores, all located in the United States, which provides us with a format to showcase the image and products of Vera Bradley.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P39_S3	As of January 31, 2015 , we operated 96 full-line stores averaging approximately 1,900 square feet per store.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P39_S4	Our sales associates are passionate about our products and customer service, which, we believe, translates into a superior shopping experience.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P39_S5	In 2006, we began selling our products through the verabradley.com website.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P39_S6	The objective of verabradley.com is to provide both a mechanism for marketing directly to consumers and a storefront where consumers can find the entire Vera Bradley collection.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P39_S7	In fiscal 2013, we invested in upgrades to our website allowing for a more user friendly homepage, enabling us to ship internationally to 15 countries, and enhancing the checkout experience.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P39_S8	In fiscal 2015, we made additional enhancements to our website, including adding product recommendations, enhancing product descriptions, adding silhouettes for product scale, generating cart and site abandonment emails, and gathering and analyzing customer feedback.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P39_S9	We had over 73 million visits to verabradley.com during fiscal 2015 .
1495320_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our factory outlet stores are a vehicle for selling retired merchandise at discounted prices, as well as factory exclusive styles, while maintaining brand integrity.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	At the end of fiscal 2015, approximately 25% of the merchandise found in our factory outlet stores was factory exclusive styles.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P40_S2	We expect factory exclusive merchandise to grow to 70% of all factory outlet merchandise in the coming years.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P40_S3	We believe our factory outlet stores are an integral part of our distribution strategy, as this format provides an additional channel of distribution for our products and enables us to better target value-oriented customers.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P40_S4	Our factory outlet stores average approximately 3,200 square feet per store.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P40_S5	As of January 31, 2015 , we operated 29 factory outlet stores.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P40_S6	Our annual outlet sale is held in the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum Exposition Center in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P40_S7	The annual outlet sale is an important tradition for Vera Bradley, has many loyal followers, and is an opportunity for us to sell our retired merchandise at discounted prices in a brand-right fashion.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P40_S8	We attracted approximately 59,000 attendees to our 2014 annual outlet sale.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our store location decisions are made based upon our comprehensive retail strategy that includes actual and planned penetration in both Indirect and Direct segments, as well as existing e-commerce demand.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	At this time, we do not believe any market has been fully penetrated.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P41_S2	We believe that expansion of our store base complements our Indirect segment by increasing brand awareness and reinforcing our brand image.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	In addition to analyzing store economics, we pay particular attention to the location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	Along with seeking co-tenants that we believe share our target customer, we seek a balanced mix of moderate and high-end retailers to encourage high levels of traffic.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P42_S2	Our target full-line store size is approximately 1,800 square feet, but we are able to work with spaces as small as 1,000 square feet or, depending on our market strategy and relevant economic factors, spaces as large as 2,800 square feet.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P42_S3	Our target factory outlet store size is approximately 3,000 square feet.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P42_S4	The focus of our store operations is providing consumers with a comfortable and memorable shopping experience.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P42_S5	We strive to make the experience interactive through special store events, such as showcasing newly launched products or celebrating our namesake s birthday.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P42_S6	Our customer service philosophy emphasizes friendly service, merchandise knowledge, and passion for the brand.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P42_S7	Consequently, an essential requirement for the success of our stores is our ability to attract, train, and retain talented, highly motivated district managers, store managers, and sales associates.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	Store Economics We believe that our retail concept and distinctive retail experience contribute to the success of our stores, most of which generate solid productivity and returns.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	We expect our full-line stores to average approximately 1,800 square feet per store, and we expect to invest approximately $0.4 million per new store, consisting of inventory costs, pre-opening costs, and build-out costs, less tenant-improvement allowances.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P43_S2	New full-line stores generate, on average, approximately $1.0 million in net revenues during the first twelve months, and the payback on our investment is expected to occur in less than 22 months.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P43_S3	We expect our factory outlet stores to average approximately 3,000 square feet per store, and we expect to invest approximately $0.4 million per new store, consisting of inventory costs, pre-opening costs, and build-out costs, less tenant-improvement allowances.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P43_S4	New factory outlet stores generate, on average, approximately $2.6 million in net revenues during the first twelve months, and the payback on our investment is expected to occur in less than 12 months.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P43_S5	As of January 31, 2015 , we sold our products in approximately 2,700 specialty retail locations, the majority of which we have had long-standing relationships with, as well as department stores, national accounts, third party e-commerce sites, our wholesale business in Japan and third-party inventory liquidation.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P43_S6	The top 30% of our specialty retailers account for approximately 70% of revenue from our specialty retailers.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P43_S7	No single account represented more than 10% of total Indirect net revenues in fiscal 2015 , with the top ten accounts representing in the aggregate approximately 30% of total Indirect net revenues.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P43_S8	The majority of our Indirect retailers have been customers for over five years.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P43_S9	In fiscal 2012, we launched our products in the department store channel.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P43_S10	We believe that having an in-house sales force results in more consistent brand presentation and messaging, enhanced support for our Indirect retailers, and a more predictable, scalable, and cost-efficient business model.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P43_S11	As of January 31, 2015 , our sales team consisted of approximately 65 in-house, full-time sales consultants.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P43_S12	The compensation structure for our sales consultants consists of a combination of fixed pay and sales-based incentives.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P43_S13	In addition to acquiring new and growing existing accounts, our sales consultants serve as a support center for our Indirect retailers by assisting and educating them in areas such as merchandising and visual presentation, marketing of the brand, product selection, and inventory management.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P43_S14	Our visual merchandising program provides our sales consultants with a framework to guide our Indirect retailers regarding optimal product placement and display that is intended to reinforce the message that our brand is distinct from those of our competitors.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	Manufacturing and Supply Chain Model Our broad-based, multi-country manufacturing and supply chain model is designed to achieve efficient, timely, and accurate order fulfillment while maintaining appropriate levels of inventory.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	Our sourcing strategy is part of the larger cross-functional product development process.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P44_S2	The overall objective for our sourcing team is to build and sustain collaborative partnerships throughout our supply chain, with a focus on identifying appropriate countries and partners to manufacture our products.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P44_S3	The sourcing team leverages its expertise in negotiation, relationship management, and change management to maintain a strong global supply chain.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P44_S4	We strive to maintain the appropriate balance of inventory to enable us to provide a high level of service to our customers, including prompt and accurate delivery of our products.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P44_S5	We have an active sales and operations planning process that helps us balance the supply and demand issues that we encounter in our business, optimize our inventory levels, and anticipate inventory needs.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P44_S6	We have also integrated our planning, forecasting, and segmentation processes under one function called Merchandise Planning and Allocation.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	The majority of our products are cotton-based.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	Our other products are made primarily from specialty fabrics, including nylon, microfiber, leather, and faux leather.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	We source our materials from various suppliers in Asia, with the majority coming from China and South Korea.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P45_S3	Our global sourcing team works with select suppliers enabling us to optimize the mix of cost, lead time, quality, and reliability within our global supply network.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P45_S4	All of our suppliers must comply with our quality standards, and we use only a limited number of pre-approved suppliers who have demonstrated a commitment to delivering the highest quality products.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P45_S5	In December 2008, we opened an office in Dongguan, China, which enables us to increase our control over the manufacturing and supply chain process and monitor compliance with our quality standards.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	Virtually all of our finished goods products are manufactured externally overseas.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	These products are made by a variety of global manufacturers located primarily in China.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	We are not dependent upon any single manufacturer for our products.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P46_S3	When determining the size of orders placed with our manufacturers, we take into account forward-looking demand, lead times for specific products, current inventory levels, and minimum order quantity requirements.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	Overseas production has resulted in substantial cost savings and a reduction of capital investment.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	With the oversight of our office in China and our independent contractors, we believe these financial benefits have been realized without sacrificing the level of quality inherent in our products or service to our customers.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	On March 10, 2015, we announced that we plan to close our manufacturing facility located in New Haven, Indiana (metropolitan Fort Wayne) beginning early in fiscal 2016, unless business conditions necessitate earlier action.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P47_S3	Refer to Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, herein, for additional information.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	In 2007, we consolidated our warehousing and shipping functions into one, 217,320 square-foot distribution center, located in Roanoke, Indiana.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	In fiscal 2013, we completed a 200,000 square-foot expansion of the distribution facility.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P48_S2	This automated, computerized facility allows Vera Bradley employees to receive information directly from the order-collection center and quickly identify the products and quantities necessary for a particular order.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P48_S3	The recent expansion resulted in capacity gains in the areas of inbound receiving, inventory storage, order fulfillment, value-add processing and shipping.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P48_S4	The facility s advanced technology enables us to more accurately process and pack orders, as well as track shipments and inventory.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P48_S5	We believe that our systems for the processing and shipment of orders from our distribution center have enabled us to improve our overall customer service through enhanced order accuracy and reduced turnaround time.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P48_S6	Our products are shipped primarily via FedEx and common carriers to our stores, our Indirect retailers and department stores, and directly to our customers who purchase through our website.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P48_S7	We believe we are positioned well to support the order fulfillment requirements of our business, including business generated through our website.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P48_S8	We believe that high levels of automation and technology are essential to maintain our competitive position.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P48_S9	We maintain computer hardware, systems applications, and networks to enhance and accelerate the design process, to support the sale and distribution of our products to our customers, and to improve the integration and efficiency of our operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P48_S10	Our management information systems are designed to provide, among other things, comprehensive order processing, production, accounting, and management information for the product development, retail, sales, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, finance, and human resources functions of our business.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P48_S11	We use several systems, including MICROS-Retail, SAP, JDA, and SCALE for our information technology requirements.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	Competition We face strong competition in each of the product lines and markets in which we compete.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	We believe that all of our products are in similar competitive positions with respect to the number of competitors they face and the level of competition within each product line.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P49_S2	Due to the number of different products we offer, it is not practicable for us to quantify the number of competitors we face.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P49_S3	Our products compete with other branded products within their product categories and with private label products sold by retailers.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P49_S4	In our Indirect business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers, and distributors of handbags, accessories, and other products for the limited space available for the display of such products to the consumer.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P49_S5	Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	In our Direct business, we compete against other independent retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, gift retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	The market for handbags, in particular, is highly competitive.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	Our competitors include not only established companies that are expanding their production and marketing of handbags, but also frequent new entrants to the market.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P50_S3	We directly compete with wholesalers and direct sellers of branded handbags and accessories, such as Coach, Nine West, Liz Claiborne, Dooney Bourke, Kate Spade, Michael Kors, Fossil, Brahmin, and Tory Burch.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P50_S4	In varying degrees, depending on the product category involved, we compete on the basis of design (aesthetic appeal), quality (construction), function, price point, distribution, and brand positioning.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P50_S5	We believe that our primary competitive advantages are consumer recognition of our brand, customer loyalty, product development expertise, and our widespread presence through our multi-channel distribution model.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P50_S6	Some of our competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources than we do.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	competitors and increased competition from existing competitors as we expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	Copyrights and Trademarks The development of new patterns includes the design of an overall print, and may also include a complementary fabric backing, and coordinating trim materials.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	Once developed, we generally copyright each pattern, including any fabric backing and coordinating trim.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P52_S2	We currently have approximately 700 copyrights.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P52_S3	We also own all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing, and distribution of all of our products, both in the United States and in the other countries in which our products are principally sold.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P52_S4	We aggressively police our trademarks and copyrights and pursue infringers and counterfeiters both domestically and internationally.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P52_S5	Our trademarks will remain in existence for as long as we continue to use and renew them on their expiration dates.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P52_S6	Employees As of January 31, 2015 , we had approximately 2,800 employees.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P52_S7	Of the total, 1,850 were engaged in retail selling positions, 565 were engaged in manufacturing and distribution functions, 35 were engaged in product design, and 350 were engaged in corporate support and administrative functions.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P52_S8	None of our employees are represented by a union.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P52_S9	We believe that our relations with our employees are good, and we have never encountered a significant work stoppage.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P52_S10	Many of our imported products are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs, or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the United States and other countries or impact the cost of such products.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P52_S11	To date, we have not been restricted by quotas in the operation of our business, and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of a majority of our products.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P52_S12	In addition, we are subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions, including U.S. retaliation against prohibited foreign practices, with respect to our product sourcing and international sales operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P52_S13	We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental matters, including the handling, transportation, and disposal of our products and our non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, and groundwater.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P52_S14	Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties, or the imposition of other liabilities.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect upon our earnings or financial position.
1495320_15_ITEM1_P53_S1	If we violate any laws or regulations, however, it could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance.

1495320_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on our website, www.verabradley.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
1495320_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	No information contained on our website is intended to be included as part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	If we are unable to successfully implement our long-term strategic plan and growth strategies, our future operating results could suffer.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	In fiscal 2015, we began to implement a long-term strategic plan focused on product, distribution and marketing strategies intended to profitably grow our business.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The success of our long-term strategic plan and these growth strategies, alone or collectively, will depend on various factors, including the appeal of our product designs, retail presentation to consumers, effectiveness of our marketing initiatives, competitive conditions, and economic conditions.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our strategic plan.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If we are unsuccessful in implementing some or all of our strategies or initiatives, our future operating results could be adversely impacted.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P1_S4	If our multi-channel distribution model is not successful, our business and results of operations may suffer.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P1_S5	We currently sell into two segments: Direct to consumers through our full-line and factory outlet stores in the United States, verabradley.com, direct-to-consumer eBay sales, and our annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana; and through our Indirect wholesale business which consists of sales to approximately 2,700 specialty retail locations, substantially all of which are located in the United States, as well as department stores, national accounts, third party e-commerce sites, the Company's wholesale business in Japan, and third party inventory liquidation.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P1_S6	These channels are sometimes in direct competition and sales through these channels may not be incremental to total sales.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P1_S7	For example, we are continuing to invest in our specialty retailers to support them in growing along with Vera Bradley.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P1_S8	This channel will continue to evolve over time as we balance the channel dynamics between the specialty retailers, department stores, our Direct stores, and e-commerce.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Changes in general economic conditions, and their impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Consumer confidence and consumer spending may be influenced by fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, changing fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, levels of unemployment and consumer debt levels, changes in net worth based on market conditions, general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment, and weather and weather-related phenomena.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty, and this could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	In the event that the U.S. economy does not sustain its current recovery, renewed decline in consumer-spending levels and other conditions, including inflation, we could experience lower than expected net revenues, which could force us to delay or slow the implementation of our growth strategies and adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our inability to predict and respond in a timely manner to changes in consumer demand could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Our success depends on our ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies consumer demand in a timely manner.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P2_S7	We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to develop appealing patterns and styles or meet changing consumer demands in the future.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P2_S8	If we misjudge the market for our products, we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P2_S9	In addition, changes to our product assortment and to our available fabrications, as well as the availability and breadth of pattern assortment may not gain consumer acceptance.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Merchandise misjudgments could adversely impact our net revenues and results of operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We may not be able to successfully open new stores and/or operate new and current stores as planned, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our future growth will depend on our ability to successfully open and operate new and current stores.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We plan to open approximately 25 new stores during fiscal 2016, and approximately 20 new stores per year thereafter.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our ability to successfully open and operate stores depends on many factors, including our ability to:
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	successfully integrate new stores into our existing operations and information technology systems.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The success of new store openings may also be affected by our ability to initiate marketing efforts in advance of opening our first store in a particular region.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Additionally, we will incur pre-opening costs and we may encounter initial losses while new stores commence operations, which could strain our resources and adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our business depends on a strong brand.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	If we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand, then we may be unable to sell our products, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We believe that the brand image that we have developed has contributed significantly to the success of our business.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	We also believe that maintaining and enhancing the Vera Bradley brand is critical to maintaining and expanding our customer base.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as product design, store operations, community relations, and marketing.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P5_S5	If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brand image, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Our results of operations could suffer if we lose key management or design associates or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Our performance depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and product development teams.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P5_S8	These executives and design associates have substantial experience in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P5_S9	Although we have entered into an employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, we may not be able to retain his services or those of other key individuals in the future.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P5_S10	The unexpected loss of services of key employees could have adverse impacts on our business and results of operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P5_S11	As our business grows and we open new stores, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees and develop, train, and manage an increasing number of management-level, sales, and other employees.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P5_S12	Competition for qualified employees is intense.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P5_S13	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain employees as needed in the future.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P5_S14	Our results of operations are subject to quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P5_S15	Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including, among other things:
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	the timing of new pattern releases and new product introductions.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Any quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	This could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	A data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, expose us to litigation risk and adversely affect our business.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We are dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet, for a significant portion of our Direct store sales, including our e-commerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We are also responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our e-commerce websites and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	As part of our normal course of business, we often collect, retain, and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information, over public networks.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	There is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Despite the security measures we currently have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Any electronic or physical security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, including penetration of our network security, whether by us or by a third-party, could disrupt our business, severely damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, expose us to risks of litigation and liability and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Since we do not control third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future, any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility, reduce our e-commerce net sales, impair our ability to attract website visitors and reduce our ability to attract and retain customers.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We may also incur significant costs in complying with the various applicable state, federal and foreign laws regarding unauthorized disclosure of personal information.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P8_S6	We are dependent on our computer systems to record and process transactions and manage and operate our business, including in designing, marketing, manufacturing, importing, tracking and distributing our products, processing payments, and accounting for and reporting results.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P8_S7	We also utilize an automated replenishment system to facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders, the movement of goods through distribution channels, and the collection of information for planning and forecasting.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P8_S8	In addition, we have e-commerce and other Internet websites in the U.S. Given the complexity of our business and the significant number of transactions that we engage in on an annual basis, it is imperative that we maintain constant operation of our computer hardware and software systems.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P8_S9	Despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from, among other things, security breaches, computer viruses or power outages.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P8_S10	Any material disruptions in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P8_S11	We may continue to experience declines in comparable sales and there can be no guarantee that the strategic initiatives we are implementing to improve our results will be successful.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P8_S12	We may not be able to regain the levels of comparable sales that we have experienced in the past and comparable sales may also further deteriorate.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P8_S13	If our future comparable sales fail to meet market expectations, then the price of our common stock could decline.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P8_S14	Also, the aggregate results of operations of our stores have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P8_S15	Numerous factors influence comparable sales, including fashion trends, competition, national and regional economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, inventory shrinkage, marketing programs, changes in consumer shopping trends, and weather conditions.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P8_S16	These factors may cause our comparable sales results to be lower in the future than in recent periods or lower than expectations, either of which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We are exposed to business risks as a result of our e-commerce operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We operate an e-commerce store at www.verabradley.com.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Expanding our e-commerce business is one of the key objectives of our business strategy.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	In addition, our e-commerce operations are subject to numerous risks, including unanticipated operating problems, reliance on third-party computer hardware and software providers, system failures and the need to invest in additional computer systems.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Specific risks include: (i) diversion of sales from our stores; (ii) rapid technological change; (iii) liability for e-commerce content; and (iv) risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate the websites and their related support systems, including computer viruses, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our inability to effectively address these risks and any other risks that we face in connection with our Internet operations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Closing stores could result in significant costs to us.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We recently closed one underperforming store and could, in the future, decide to close additional stores that are producing losses or that are not as profitable as we expect.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If we decide to close any stores before the expiration of their lease terms, we may incur payments to landlords to terminate or buy out the remaining term of the lease.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We also may incur costs related to the employees at such stores, whether or not we terminate the leases early.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Upon any such closure, the closing costs, including fixed assets and inventory write-downs, could adversely affect our results and could adversely affect our cash on hand.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We lease all of our store locations.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We typically occupy our stores under operating leases with terms of ten years.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We have been able to negotiate favorable rental rates in recent years due in part to the state of the economy and high vacancy rates within some shopping centers, but there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to negotiate such favorable terms.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Some of our leases have early cancellation clauses, which permit the lease to be terminated by us or the landlord if certain sales levels are not met in specific periods or if the shopping center does not meet specified occupancy standards.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P11_S5	In addition to requiring future minimum lease payments, some of our store leases provide for the payment of common area maintenance charges, real property insurance, and real estate taxes.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Many of our lease agreements have escalating rent provisions over the initial term and any extensions.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P11_S7	As we expand our store base, our lease expense and our cash outlays for rent under lease agreements will increase.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including:
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	limiting our ability to obtain additional financing.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Any of these consequences could place us at a disadvantage with respect to our competitors.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We depend on cash flow from operating activities to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses and needs, we may not be able to service our lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would harm our business.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Additional sites that we lease may be subject to long-term non-cancelable leases if we are unable to negotiate our current standard lease terms.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, including paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Moreover, even if a lease has an early cancellation clause, we may not satisfy the contractual requirements for early cancellation under the lease.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Our inability to enter new leases or renew existing leases on acceptable terms or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that we close would, in any such case, affect us adversely.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our failure to effectively compete with other retailers for sales could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The market for bags, accessories, and travel items is increasingly competitive.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	establishing and maintaining good working relationships with our Indirect retailers.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In our Indirect business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers, and distributors of handbags, accessories, and other products for the limited space available for the display of such products to the consumer.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	compete against other gift and specialty retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, in light of a continued difficult consumer environment, pricing is a significant driver of consumer choice in our industry and we regularly engage in price competition, particularly through our promotional programs.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	To the extent that we decrease our promotional activity, our ability to maintain sales levels may be impacted.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our Company's ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping centers in which many of our stores are located.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Substantially all of our Direct stores are located in regional mall shopping centers and many of our Indirect customers are also located in these shopping centers.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Factors beyond our control impact mall traffic, such as general economic conditions and consumer spending levels.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Consumer spending and mall traffic have been depressed in recent years.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	As a result, mall operators have been facing increasing operational and financial difficulties.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	The increasing inability of mall anchor tenants and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic around our stores, the increasing inability of mall operators to attract anchor tenants and maintain viable operations and the increasing departures of existing anchor and other mall tenants due to declines in the sales volume and in the popularity of certain malls as shopping destinations, have reduced and may continue to reduce our sales volume and, consequently, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We rely on various contract manufacturers to produce a significant majority of our products and generally do not have long-term contracts with our manufacturers.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Disruptions in our contract manufacturers systems, losses of manufacturing certifications, or other actions by these manufacturers could increase our cost of sales, adversely affect our net revenues, and injure our reputation and customer relationships, thereby harming our business.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Our various contract manufacturers produce a significant majority of our products.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We generally do not enter into long-term formal written agreements with our manufacturers and instead transact business with each of them on an order-by-order basis.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In the event of a disruption in our contract manufacturers systems, we may be unable to locate alternative manufacturers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Identifying a suitable manufacturer is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with the prospective manufacturer s quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability, labor practices and environmental compliance.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Any delay, interruption, or increased cost in the manufactured products that might occur for any reason, such as the lack of long-term contracts or regulatory requirements and the loss of certifications, power interruptions, fires, hurricanes, war, or threats of terrorism, could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products, adversely affect our net revenues, increase our cost of sales, and hurt our results of operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P20_S7	In addition, manufacturing disruption could injure our reputation and customer relationships, thereby harming our business.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We rely on various suppliers to supply a significant majority of our raw materials.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Disruption in the supply of raw materials could increase our cost of goods sold and if there is not sufficient raw materials available to meet product demand, our product revenue could decline.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We generally do not enter into long-term formal written agreements with our suppliers and typically transact business with each of them on an order-by-order basis.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	As a result, we cannot assure that there will be no significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from our current sources or, in the event of a disruption, that we would be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	In such a case, we could have difficulty meeting consumer demand and net revenues could be adversely impacted.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We rely on a single distribution facility for all of the products we sell.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Disruption to that facility could adversely impact our results of operations, and expansion of that facility could have unpredictable adverse effects.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Our distribution operations are currently concentrated in a single, company-owned distribution center in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Any significant disruption in the operation of the facility due to natural disaster or severe weather, or events such as fire, accidents, power outages, system failures, or other unforeseen causes, could devalue or damage a significant portion of our inventory and could adversely affect our product distribution and sales until such time as we could secure an alternative facility.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P22_S4	If we encounter difficulties with our distribution facility or other problems or disasters arise, we cannot ensure that critical systems and operations will be restored in a timely manner or at all, and this would have a material adverse effect on our business.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P22_S5	In addition, our growth could require us to further expand our current facility, which could affect us adversely in ways that we cannot predict.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The cost of raw materials could increase our cost of sales and cause our results of operations to suffer.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Fluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of fabrics or other raw materials used to manufacture our products, as well as the price for labor, marketing, and transportation, could have adverse impacts on our cost of sales and our ability to meet our customers demands.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In particular, fluctuations in the price of cotton, our primary raw material, could have an adverse impact on our cost of sales.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In addition, because a key component of our products is petroleum-based, the cost of oil affects the cost of our products.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Upward movement in the price of oil in the global oil markets would also likely result in rising fuel and freight prices, which could increase our shipping costs.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P23_S5	In the future, we may not be able to pass all or a portion of higher costs on to our customers.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing and manufacturing activities.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P23_S7	We source our fabrics primarily from manufacturers in China and South Korea and outsource the production of a significant majority of our products to companies in Asia.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P23_S8	We are subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing and manufacturing, including, but not limited to:
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	natural disasters, acts of war and terrorism, changing macroeconomic trends, and other external factors over which we have no control.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Additionally, we do not have complete oversight over our contract manufacturers.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Violation of labor or other laws by those manufacturers, or the divergence of a contract manufacturer s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States or in other markets in which we may in the future do business, could also draw negative publicity for us and our brand, diminishing the value of our brand and reducing demand for our products.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Our ability to source our products at favorable prices, or at all, could be harmed, with adverse effects on our results of operations, if new trade restrictions are imposed or if existing trade restrictions become more burdensome.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	A significant majority of our products are currently manufactured for us in Asia.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The United States and the countries in which our products are produced have imposed and may impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or regulations or may adversely adjust prevailing quotas, duties, or tariffs.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Countries impose, modify, and remove tariffs and other trade restrictions in response to a diverse array of factors, including global and national economic and political conditions, which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other trade restrictions.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Trade restrictions, which include embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us or could require us to modify supply chain organization or other current business practices, any of which could harm our results of operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	We may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Currently, none of our employees are represented by a union.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Nevertheless, our employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to organize or affiliate with a union.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P26_S6	If some or all of our workforce were to become unionized, our business would be exposed to work stoppages and slowdowns as a unionized business.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P26_S7	If, in addition, the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly more favorable to union workers than our current pay-and-benefits arrangements, our costs would increase and our results of operations would suffer.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P26_S8	We rely on independent transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We currently rely on independent transportation service providers for substantially all of our product shipments.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, employee strikes and inclement weather, which may impact the shipping company s ability to provide delivery services sufficient to meet our shipping needs.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	If for any reason we were to change shipping companies, we could face logistical difficulties that might adversely affect deliveries, and we would incur costs and expend resources in the course of making the change.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Moreover, we might not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from the service providers that we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We also would face shipping and distribution risks and uncertainties associated with any expansion of our distribution facility and related systems.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Our inability or failure to protect our intellectual property or our infringement of other s intellectual property could have a negative impact on our operating results.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P28_S5	We believe that our registered copyrights, registered and common law trademarks, and other proprietary rights have significant value and are critical to our ability to create and sustain demand for our products.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P28_S6	Although we have not been inhibited from selling our products in connection with intellectual property disputes, we cannot assure you that obstacles will not arise as we expand our product line and extend our brand as well as the geographic scope of our sales and marketing.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P28_S7	We also cannot assure you that the actions taken by us to establish and protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products or infringement of our rights by others.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P28_S8	The legal regimes of some foreign countries, particularly China, may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by others in these countries.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P28_S9	The loss of copyrights, trademarks, and other proprietary rights could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P28_S10	Any litigation regarding our proprietary rights could be time consuming and costly.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P28_S11	We are also subject to the risk that claims will be brought against us for infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties, seeking to block the sale of our products as violative of their intellectual property rights or payment of monetary amounts.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P28_S12	In particular, we are subject to copyright infringement claims for which we may not be entitled to indemnification from our suppliers.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P28_S13	In addition, in recent years, companies in the retail industry, including us, have been subject to patent infringement claims from non-practicing entities, or patent trolls.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P28_S14	Any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming and result in costly litigation.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P28_S15	As a result, any such claim, or the combination of multiple claims, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P28_S16	If we are required to stop using any of our registered or nonregistered trademarks, our sales could decline and, consequently, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P28_S17	Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results and stock price.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We are subject to income taxes in many U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which includes reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Further, possible changes in federal, state, local, and non-U.S. tax laws bearing upon our revenues, income, property, or other aspects of our operations or business would, if enacted, affect our results of operations in ways and to a degree that we cannot currently predict.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We plan to use cash provided by operating activities to fund our expanding business and execute our growth strategies and may require additional capital, which may not be available to us.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Our business relies on cash provided by operating activities as our primary source of liquidity.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P30_S4	To support our business and execute our long term strategies, we will need significant amounts of cash from that source.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P30_S5	If our business does not generate cash flow from operating activities sufficient to fund these activities, and if sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from our existing revolving credit facility, we will need to seek additional capital, through debt or equity financings, to fund our growth.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P30_S6	If new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, then we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would inhibit our growth and could harm our business.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P30_S7	We have recorded asset impairment charges in the past and we may record material asset impairment charges in the future.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Quarterly, we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	If we determine that the carrying value of long-lived assets is not recoverable, we will be required to record impairment charges relating to those assets.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P31_S2	For example, our assessments during fiscal 2015 indicated that operating losses or insufficient operating income existed at certain retail stores, with a projection that the operating losses or insufficient operating income for those locations would continue.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P31_S3	As such, we recorded non-cash charges of $0.4 million during fiscal 2015 within asset impairment in the consolidated statements of operations to write down the carrying values of these stores' long-lived assets to their estimated fair values.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our quarterly evaluation of store assets includes consideration of current and historical performance and projections of future profitability.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The profitability projections rely upon estimates made by us, including store-level sales, gross margins, and direct expenses, and, by their nature, include judgments about how current strategic initiatives will impact future performance.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	If we are not able to achieve the projected key financial metrics for any reason, including because any of the strategic initiatives being implemented do not result in significant improvements in our current financial performance trend, this would indicate that the value of our long-lived assets was not recoverable and we would incur additional impairment of assets in the future.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P32_S3	In the event we record additional impairment charges, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Our Indirect business could suffer as a result of bankruptcies or operational or financial difficulties of our Indirect retailers.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P32_S5	We do not enter into long-term agreements with any of our Indirect retailers.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P32_S6	Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers for each of our lines every season.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P32_S7	A decision by a significant number of Indirect retailers, whether motivated by competitive conditions, operational or financial difficulties, reduced access to capital, or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or to change their manner of doing business with us could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P32_S8	Although we recommend retail sale prices for our products to our Indirect retailers, we do not provide dealer allowances or other economic incentives to support those prices.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P32_S9	Possible promotional pricing or discounting by Indirect retailers in response to softening retail demand could have a negative effect on our brand image and prestige, which might be difficult to counteract as the economy improves.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We sell our Indirect merchandise primarily to specialty retail stores across the United States and extend trade credit based on an evaluation of each Indirect retailer s financial condition, usually without requiring collateral.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Perceived financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Pending the resolution of a relationship with a financially troubled Indirect retailer, we might assume credit risk that we would otherwise avoid relating to our receivables from that customer.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Inability to collect on accounts receivable from our Indirect retailers would adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P34_S3	There are claims made against us from time to time that can result in litigation or regulatory proceedings, which could distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability or damage to our brand image.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P34_S4	As a growing company with expanding operations, we increasingly face the risk of litigation and other claims against us.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Litigation and other claims may arise in the ordinary course of our business and include employee claims, custom and duty claims, commercial disputes, intellectual property issues, product-oriented allegations, and slip and fall claims.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P34_S6	Often these cases raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P34_S7	Litigation and other claims against us could result in unexpected expenses and liability, as well as materially adversely affect our operations and our reputation.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P34_S8	Changes in the health care regulatory environment could cause us to incur additional expense and our failure to comply with related legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law in the U.S.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	This legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage for those already insured.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We do not expect any material short-term impact on our financial results as a result of the legislation; however, as additional requirements from the legislation continue to go into effect, we expect to incur an increase in our expenses.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P35_S3	If this legislation and future changes in health care legislation significantly increase our expenses, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Risks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock Our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell shares at or above the price at which you purchase them.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P35_S5	The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	These and other factors may result in a lower market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	In addition, the stock markets, including The Nasdaq Global Select Market, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many retail companies.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P36_S3	If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Over the last few years, proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies in retail businesses.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We could become engaged in a consent solicitation, or proxy contest, or experience other stockholder activism, in the future.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Activist shareholders may advocate for certain governance and strategic changes at our company.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	In the event of stockholder activism, particularly with respect to matters which our Board of Directors, in exercising their fiduciary duties, disagree with or have determined not to pursue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management, and perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners and customers.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P39_S2	In addition, if faced with a consent solicitation or proxy contest, we may not be able to respond successfully to the contest or dispute, which would be disruptive to our business.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Even if we are successful, if individuals are elected to our Board with a differing agenda, our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders may be adversely affected.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P39_S4	A limited number of shareholders control a large percentage of the voting power of our common stock, and therefore investors may have limited ability to determine the outcome of shareholder votes.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Michael Ray (former CEO and Ms. Bradley Baekgaard's son in-law), Robert Hall, Barbara Bradley Baekgaard, Joan Hall (Mr. Hall s wife and Ms. Bradley Baekgaard s daughter), Patricia R. Miller and P. Michael Miller, directly or indirectly, beneficially own and have the ability to exercise voting control over, in the aggregate, 43.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of January 31, 2015 .
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P39_S6	As a result, these shareholders are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, any amendments to our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and significant corporate transactions.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P39_S7	This concentrated ownership of outstanding common stock may limit your ability to influence corporate matters, and the interests of these shareholders may not coincide with our interests or your interests.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P39_S8	As a result, we may take actions that you do not believe to be in our interests or your interests and that could depress our stock price.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P39_S9	In addition, this significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock should investors perceive disadvantages in owning shares of common stock in a company that has such concentrated ownership.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	From time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management s estimates as of the date of release.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in the release.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed, but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P41_S3	We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data are forecast.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P42_S4	In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Indiana law may discourage or prevent a change in control, even if a sale of the Company would be beneficial to our shareholders, which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by shareholders to replace or remove our current management.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control, discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock, harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	requiring advance notice for raising business matters or nominating directors at shareholders meetings.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	As permitted by our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, our board of directors also has the ability, should they so determine, to adopt a shareholder rights agreement, sometimes called a poison pill, providing for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common stock.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	In the event of a takeover attempt, this preferred stock would give rights to holders of common stock (other than the potential acquirer) to buy additional shares of common stock at a discount, leading to the dilution of the potential acquirer s stake.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The adoption of a poison pill, or the board s ability to do so, can have negative effects such as those described above.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	As an Indiana corporation, we are governed by the Indiana Business Corporation Law (as amended from time to time, the IBCL ).
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Under specified circumstances, certain provisions of the IBCL related to control share acquisitions, business combinations and constituent interests may delay, prevent or make more difficult unsolicited acquisitions or changes of control of us.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P46_S2	These provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our management.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P46_S3	It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that shareholders might deem to be in their best interest.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P46_S4	We may suffer negative publicity and our business may be harmed if we need to recall any products we sell.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P46_S5	We have in the past needed to, and may in the future need to, recall products that we determine may present safety issues.
1495320_15_ITEM1A_P46_S6	If products we sell have safety problems of which we are not aware, or if we or the Consumer Product Safety Commission recall a product sold in our stores, we may suffer negative publicity and, potentially, product liability lawsuits, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations or cash flows.

1495320_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	Dividends Our common stock began trading on October 21, 2010, following our initial public offering.
1495320_15_ITEM5_P3_S1	Since that time, we have not declared any cash dividends, and we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1495320_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	Stock Performance Graph The graph set forth below compares the cumulative shareholder return on our common stock between October 21, 2010 (the date of our initial public offering), and January 31, 2015 , to the cumulative return of (i) the S P 500 Index and (ii) the S P 500 Apparel, Accessories, and Luxury Goods Index over the same period.
1495320_15_ITEM5_P4_S1	This graph assumes an initial investment of $100 on October 21, 2010, in our common stock, the S P 500 Index, and the S P 500 Apparel, Accessories, and Luxury Goods Index and assumes the reinvestment of dividends, if any.

1495320_15_ITEM5_P9_S5	(4) Comparable sales (including e-commerce) are calculated based upon our stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months and net revenues from our e-commerce operations.
1495320_15_ITEM5_P9_S6	Increase or decrease is reported as a percentage of the comparable sales for the same period in the prior fiscal year.
1495320_15_ITEM5_P9_S7	Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage.
1495320_15_ITEM5_P9_S8	Calculation excludes sales for the 53 rd week in fiscal 2013.
1495320_15_ITEM5_P10_S0	Average net revenues per gross square foot are calculated by dividing total net revenues for our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the period by total gross square footage for those stores.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	We opened 13 new full-line stores and 14 factory outlet stores during the year.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	We made progress on our distribution strategies, including:
1495320_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Transitioning to a wholesale business model in Japan.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	We strengthened our management team with the addition of several key executives in merchandising, marketing, and retail and wholesale.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	We worked to make our supply chain more efficient.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	In June 2014, we entered into a five-year agreement with Mitsubishi Corporation Fashion Company and Look Inc. to import and distribute Vera Bradley products in Japan.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	As a result of moving to this wholesale business model, we exited our direct business in Japan during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and are accounting for it as a discontinued operation.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Consolidated income statement and Direct segment results for the current and prior periods presented are reported on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise stated.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	Restructuring On March 10, 2015, we announced that we plan to close our manufacturing facility located in New Haven, Indiana (metropolitan Fort Wayne) beginning early in fiscal 2016, unless business conditions necessitate earlier action.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	Currently, approximately 5% of our products are manufactured in this facility, and approximately 250 associates are employed there.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	We began manufacturing in this facility in 2009.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P7_S3	We incurred charges of approximately $3.0 million ($1.9 million after tax) relating to the facility closing in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, primarily related to raw materials inventory write-downs.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P7_S4	These charges are reflected in cost of sales in our Consolidated Financial Statements and within the Indirect segment.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P7_S5	We expect to incur restructuring and other charges in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending January 30, 2016 estimated to be between $6.0 million to $7.0 million ($3.8 million to $4.5 million after tax), related to the facility closing and other cost saving measures.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P7_S6	These charges are estimated to include lease termination costs of approximately $2.5 million, severance and benefit costs of approximately $2.3 million, accelerated depreciation related to fixed assets of approximately $0.8 million and other associated costs of approximately $0.9 million.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P7_S7	We expect that the plant closure will reduce operating costs by approximately $12.0 million annually beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P7_S8	All production from the facility will be absorbed by our third party manufacturing suppliers.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P7_S9	See Note 16, Restructuring , for additional information regarding the restructuring charges.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	How We Assess the Performance of Our Business In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Net Revenues Net revenues reflect revenues from the sale of our merchandise and from distribution and shipping and handling fees, less returns and discounts.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	Revenues for the Direct segment reflect sales through our full-line and factory outlet stores, verabradley.com, direct-to-consumer eBay sales, and our annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	Revenues for the Indirect segment reflect sales to specialty retail partners, department stores, national accounts, third party e-commerce sites, our wholesale business in Japan, and third party inventory liquidation.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	We believe hyper-promotional activity, which we define as discounts of 70% or more, has been damaging to our brand and we intend to strategically reduce our use of this type of promotion both in our Direct stores and on verabradley.com.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	We believe that this action may have a negative impact on revenue in fiscal 2016, but we believe it is the right action for the long-term health of the business and the brand.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Comparable Sales Comparable sales (including e-commerce) are calculated based upon our stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months and net revenues from our e-commerce operations.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	Comparable store sales are calculated based solely upon our stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales and comparable store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales differently than we do.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	similar data made available by other companies.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Non-comparable sales include sales from stores not included in comparable sales or comparable store sales.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Measuring the change in year-over-year comparable sales allows us to evaluate how our store base and e-commerce operations are performing.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	Various factors affect our comparable sales, including:
1495320_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	The timing and success of promotional and advertising efforts.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	In recent years, comparable sale performance has been challenged.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	With that in mind, we are slowing our full-line store opening rate in fiscal 2016 to 15 planned stores from an average of approximately 20 in prior years.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P16_S3	We will continue to evaluate our plans for store openings in future years in light of demand and store performance.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P16_S4	Gross Profit Gross profit is equal to our net revenues less our cost of sales.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Cost of sales includes the direct cost of purchased and manufactured merchandise, distribution center costs, operations overhead, duty, and all inbound freight costs incurred.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	The components of our reported cost of sales may not be comparable to those of other retail and wholesale companies.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Gross profit can be impacted by changes in volume; fluctuations in sales price; operational efficiencies, such as leveraging of fixed costs; promotional activities, such as free shipping; commodity prices, such as cotton prices; and labor costs.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	A expenses include selling; advertising, marketing, and product development; and administrative.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	Selling expenses include Direct business expenses such as store expenses, employee compensation, and store occupancy and supply costs, as well as Indirect business expenses consisting primarily of employee compensation and other expenses associated with sales to Indirect retailers.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	Advertising, marketing, and product development expenses include employee compensation, media costs, creative production expenses, marketing agency fees, new product design costs, public relations expenses, and market research expenses.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P18_S4	A portion of our advertising expenses may be reimbursed by Indirect retailers, and such amount is classified as other income.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P18_S5	Administrative expenses include employee compensation for corporate functions, corporate headquarters occupancy costs, consulting and software expenses, and charitable donations.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P18_S6	Other Income We support many of our Indirect retailers marketing efforts by distributing certain catalogs and promotional mailers to current and prospective customers.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P18_S7	Our Indirect retailers reimburse us for a portion of the cost to produce these materials.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P18_S8	Reimbursement received is recorded as other income.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P18_S9	The related cost to design, produce, and distribute the catalogs and mailers is recorded as SG A expense.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P18_S10	Other income also includes proceeds from the sales of tickets to our annual outlet sale.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P18_S11	Operating Income Operating income is equal to gross profit less SG A expenses plus other income.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P18_S12	Operating income excludes interest income, interest expense, and income taxes.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P18_S13	Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations is equal to operating income less net interest expense and income taxes.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is equal to the loss from the results of operations related to the direct Japan business, which was exited in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, adjusted for the associated tax benefit.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	Net Income Net income is equal to the sum of income from continuing operations and loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	The following tables summarize key components of our consolidated results of operations for the last three fiscal years, both in dollars and as a percentage of our net revenues.

1495320_15_ITEM7_P22_S4	(4) Comparable sales (including e-commerce) are calculated based upon our stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months and net revenues from our e-commerce operations.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P22_S5	Increase or decrease is reported as a percentage of the comparable sales for the same period in the prior fiscal year.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P22_S6	Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P22_S7	Calculation excludes sales for the 53 rd week in fiscal 2013.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Average net revenues per gross square foot are calculated by dividing total net revenues for our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the period by total gross square footage for those stores.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 Net Revenues For fiscal 2015 , net revenues decreased $21.9 million , or 4.1% , to $509.0 million , from $530.9 millio n for fiscal 2014 .
1495320_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	For fiscal 2015 , net revenues increased $14.5 million , or 4.5% , to $335.6 million , from $321.1 million for fiscal 2014 .
1495320_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	This change resulted from a $39.8 million increase in revenues at our non-comparable stores which included 27 additional full-line and factory outlet stores and gift card breakage revenue of $1.4 million along with a comparable sales (including e-commerce) decrease of $23.1 million , or 7.6% (which includes a 3.9% increase in e-commerce sales).

1495320_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Comparable sales (including e-commerce) and comparable store sales were negatively impacted by year-over-year declines in store traffic.

1495320_15_ITEM7_P26_S5	The increase in SG A expenses as a percent of net revenues was primarily due to strategic investments which include new store expenses, key management additions and marketing and e-commerce initiatives.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P26_S6	Other Income For fiscal 2015 , other income decreased $1.1 million , or 21.8% , to $3.7 million , from $4.8 million for fiscal 2014 .
1495320_15_ITEM7_P26_S7	The decrease in other income was in line with a decrease in associated advertising costs related to mailers for our specialty retailers.

1495320_15_ITEM7_P27_S6	The decrease was due primarily to no borrowings occurring during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 .
1495320_15_ITEM7_P27_S7	For fiscal 2015 , we recorded income tax expense of $22.8 million at an effective tax rate of 35.9% , compared to 36.8% for fiscal 2014 .

1495320_15_ITEM7_P27_S10	The year-over-year increase is primarily due to the write-off of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Net Income For fiscal 2015 , net income decreased $20.4 million , or 34.6% , to $38.4 million from $58.8 million in fiscal 2014.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Net Revenues For fiscal 2014, net revenues decreased $4.8 million, or 0.9%, to $530.9 million, from $535.7 million for fiscal 2013, primarily due to an additional 7 days included in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2014, which accounted for additional net revenues in fiscal 2013 of $4.9 million, as well as decreased volume in fiscal 2014.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	For fiscal 2014, net revenues increased $34.0 million, or 11.8%, to $321.1 million, from $287.1 million for fiscal 2013.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	This growth resulted primarily from a $37.6 million increase in revenues at our non-comparable stores which included 23 additional full-line and factory outlet stores which is partially offset by a comparable sales (including e-commerce) decrease of $3.6 million, or 1.3% (which includes a 3.8% increase in e-commerce sales).
1495320_15_ITEM7_P29_S3	Our comparable store sales decreased 5.7%.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P29_S4	The decreases in comparable sales (including e-commerce) and comparable store sales related to year-over-year declines in traffic, a lower average transaction size, and underperformance of the product offering.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P29_S5	The number of our stores grew from 76 at the end of fiscal 2013 to 99 at the end of fiscal 2014.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P29_S6	For fiscal 2014, net revenues decreased $38.8 million, or 15.6%, to $209.8 million, from $248.6 million for fiscal 2013, primarily due to lower orders from the Company s specialty retailers combined with closing approximately 400 wholesale accounts during the year, through a combination of remediation, natural attrition, and a more selective approach to opening new specialty retail stores.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P29_S7	Gross Profit For fiscal 2014, gross profit decreased $12.3 million, or 4.0%, to $292.2 million, from $304.5 million for fiscal 2013.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P29_S8	As a percentage of net revenues, gross profit decreased to 55.0% for fiscal 2014, from 56.9% for fiscal 2013.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P29_S9	The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a $4.8 million inventory write-down, increased year-over-year promotional activity, as well as the sales mix of lower-margin product.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P29_S10	For fiscal 2014, SG A expenses increased $4.1 million, or 2.1%, to $201.2 million, from $197.1 million for fiscal 2013.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P29_S11	As a percentage of net revenues, SG A expenses were 37.9% and 36.8% for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P29_S12	The increase in SG A expenses as a percent of net revenues was primarily due to fixed expenses being spread over lower revenues in the Indirect segment, the deleveraging of store operating expenses, and the impact of employee-related expenses from headcount added in the first half of fiscal 2014, partially offset by reductions in variable compensation expense associated with Company performance.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P29_S13	Other Income For fiscal 2014, other income decreased $1.5 million, or 23.9%, to $4.8 million, from $6.3 million for fiscal 2013.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P29_S14	The decrease in other income was in line with a decrease in associated advertising costs related to mailers for our specialty retailers.

1495320_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	This decrease as a percentage of net revenues in the Direct segment was primarily due to sales of lower-margin product accounting for a higher percentage of total segment revenue, as well as increased promotional activity.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P30_S3	For fiscal 2014, operating income decreased $16.9 million, or 16.8%.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P30_S4	As a percentage of Indirect segment net revenues, operating income in the Indirect segment was 40.1% and 40.7% for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P30_S5	This decrease as a percentage of net revenues in the Indirect segment resulted primarily from deleveraging of the relatively fixed SG A expenses against sales declines.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P30_S6	For fiscal 2014, unallocated expenses decreased $6.4 million, or 8.4%, primarily as a result of discretionary spending cuts and reductions in variable compensation expense associated with the Company s financial performance.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P30_S7	For fiscal 2014, net interest expense decreased $0.1 million, or 15.9%, to $0.6 million, from $0.7 million in fiscal 2013.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P30_S8	The decrease was due to lower average borrowing levels in fiscal 2014.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	For fiscal 2014, we recorded income tax expense of $35.1 million at an effective tax rate of 36.8%, compared to 35.9% for fiscal 2013.

1495320_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	We also have access to additional liquidity, if needed, through borrowings under our $125.0 million amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Historically, our primary cash needs have been for merchandise inventories; payroll; store rent; capital expenditures associated with operational equipment, buildings, information technology, and opening new stores; and debt repayments.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	The most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, merchandise inventories, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current liabilities.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	We believe that cash flows from operating activities and the availability of borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, share repurchases, and debt payments for the foreseeable future.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P33_S3	Cash Flow Analysis A summary of operating, investing, and financing activities is shown in the following table (in thousands):
1495320_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation, the effect of changes in assets and liabilities, and tenant-improvement allowances received from landlords under our store leases.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $103.8 million during fiscal 2015 , as compared to $87.9 million during fiscal 2014 .
1495320_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	The increase was primarily due to a reduction in inventory of $44.2 million , partially offset by a decrease in net income and accounts payable of $20.4 million and $10.0 million , respectively.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P34_S3	Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $87.9 million during fiscal 2014, as compared to $51.5 million during fiscal 2013.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P34_S4	This increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by a net working capital increase of $44.5 million, which was the result of a $19.4 million lower inventory balance and an increase in accounts payable of $25.3 million.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P34_S5	This increase in net working capital was partially offset by a decrease in net income of $10.1 million.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P34_S6	Net cash provided by operating activities was $51.5 million in fiscal 2013.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P34_S7	Net income increased $10.9 million, non-cash changes in balances increased $12.8 million, and income taxes payable provided an incremental increase of $13.7 million, offset by working capital changes including an incremental inventory build of $24.6 million and an incremental reduction in accounts payable of $12.4 million.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for growth related to new store openings, buildings, operational equipment, and information technology investments.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	Net cash used in investing activities was $37.1 million in fiscal 2015 , compared to $22.9 million in fiscal 2014 .
1495320_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	The $14.2 million increase in capital expenditures was driven primarily by the corporate campus expansion project and the cost associated with the opening of four additional stores during fiscal 2015.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P35_S3	Net cash used in investing activities was $22.9 million in fiscal 2014, compared to $35.9 million in fiscal 2013.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P35_S4	The $13.0 million decrease in capital expenditures was driven primarily by the expansion of the distribution facility which occurred in fiscal 2013, partially offset by the cost associated with opening of three additional stores during fiscal 2014.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P35_S5	Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are expected to be approximately $31.0 million .
1495320_15_ITEM7_P35_S6	Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $13.6 million in fiscal 2015 which was primarily related to purchases of shares of the Company's common stock made under the 2014 Share Repurchase Program.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P35_S7	This compares to net cash used in financing activities of $15.3 million in fiscal 2014, primarily resulting from $15.0 million net payments under our amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P35_S8	Net cash used in financing activities was $10.8 million in fiscal 2013, resulting from $10.0 million net payments under our amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On October 4, 2010, Vera Bradley Designs, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an agreement to amend and restate its credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, as administrative agent, and certain other lenders.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	The amended and restated credit agreement provides for a revolving credit commitment of $125.0 million.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	On June 1, 2012, Vera Bradley Designs, Inc., entered into an amendment to the credit agreement that extended the maturity date from October 3, 2015, to June 1, 2017.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P36_S3	Certain permitted indebtedness covenants were also amended.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	All borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	The credit agreement is also guaranteed by the Company.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P37_S2	The credit agreement requires us to comply with various financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.20 to 1.00 and a leverage ratio of not more than 3.50 to 1.00.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P37_S3	The agreement also contains various other covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of certain indebtedness, liens, investments, acquisitions, and asset sales.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P37_S4	We were in compliance with these covenants as of January 31, 2015 .
1495320_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	The agreement includes customary events of default (subject to cure and notice periods), including failure to pay any principal obligations when due and payable, failure to pay any interest or fee when due and payable, and failure to provide notice to the lenders of any event of default, among others.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement bear interest at either LIBOR plus the applicable margin (ranging from 1.05% to 2.05%) or the alternate base rate (as defined in the agreement) plus the applicable margin (ranging from 0.05% to 1.05%).
1495320_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	The applicable margin is tied to our leverage ratio.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	defined in the agreement) ranging from 0.20% to 0.45% of the revolving credit commitment.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	As of January 31, 2015 , the Company had borrowing availability of $125.0 million under the agreement.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	We enter into long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily non-cancellable operating leases.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	As of January 31, 2015 , our contractual cash obligations over the next several periods are as follows:
1495320_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	(1) Our store leases generally range from five to ten years with varying renewal options.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	Our future operating lease obligations would change if we were to extend these leases, or if we were to enter into new operating leases.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	(2) Purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	(3) Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our uncertain tax positions at January 31, 2015 , we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P43_S2	Therefore, $3.0 million of uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosures relating to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	We evaluate our accounting policies, estimates, and judgments on an on-going basis.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P45_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P45_S4	We evaluate the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and believe that the following policies and estimates involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position, and are therefore discussed as critical.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	The following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent results of operations.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	Our historical results for the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, however, have not been materially impacted by such variances.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	More information on all of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from the sale of our products is recognized upon customer receipt of the product when collection of the associated receivables is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and ownership and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, which, for e-commerce and most Indirect sales, reflects an estimate of shipments that customers have not yet received.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	The adjustment of these shipments is based on actual delivery dates to the customer.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	Significant changes in shipping terms or delivery times could materially impact our revenues in a given period.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	We reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	In the Direct business returns are refunded by issuing the same payment tender of the original purchase and in the Indirect business the customer is issued a credit to its account to apply to outstanding invoices.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Merchandise exchanges of the same product at the same price are not considered merchandise returns.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	Product returns are often resalable through our annual outlet sale or other channels.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	The balance of the reserve for returns, customer shipments not yet received, and general credits was $3.7 million as of both January 31, 2015 , and February 1, 2014 .
1495320_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	We sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers and do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	Gift cards that we issue are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed, at which point revenue is recognized.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P52_S2	In addition, we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	We determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P54_S2	Market is determined based on net realizable value, which includes costs to dispose.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P54_S3	Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excess quantities, and other factors, including the popularity of a pattern or product, in evaluating net realizable value.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	We record valuation adjustments to our inventories, which are reflected in cost of sales, if the cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	This adjustment calculation requires us to make assumptions and estimates, which are based on factors such as merchandise seasonality, historical trends, and estimated sales and inventory levels, including sell-through of remaining units.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P55_S2	In addition, as part of inventory adjustments, we provide for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from our physical inventory counts.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P55_S3	We perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrinkage provision accordingly.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P55_S4	Inventory adjustments of $9.7 million and $8.9 million were recorded for these matters as of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2015 , and February 1, 2014 , respectively.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P55_S5	These adjustments related primarily to raw materials of retired patterns and certain merchandise from the baby gift category, which was discontinued by the Company, as well as a reserve related to the closure of our domestic manufacturing facility.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P55_S6	We have the ability to move retired finished goods through a number of channels, including the annual outlet sale, our website and factory outlet stores, and through third-party liquidators as needed.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is based on our pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained; (2) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	Taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	We believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	Taxing authorities, however, may take a contrary position.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P57_S3	Our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if, upon final resolution with taxing authorities, we prevail in positions for which we have established reserves, or are required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Valuation of Long-lived Assets Property, plant, and equipment assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	In evaluating an asset for recoverability, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset at the store level, the lowest identifiable level of cash flow, if applicable.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset is less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, usually determined by an estimated discounted cash flow analysis of the asset.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	Factors used in the valuation of long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, our plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results, and projected future cash flows.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	With respect to our stores, we analyze store economics, location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies in our selection process.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Impairment charges are classified in SG A expenses and were $0.4 million and $1.2 million for the periods ended January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014 , respectively.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	The discounted cash flow models used to estimate the applicable fair values involve numerous estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	Changes to these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the fair value estimates.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	The estimates and assumptions critical to the overall fair value estimates include: (1) estimated future cash flow generated at the store level; and (2) discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair values.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P63_S3	These and other estimates and assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and our expectations and may change in the future based on period-specific facts and circumstances.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P63_S4	If economic conditions were to deteriorate, future impairment charges may be required.
1495320_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Transactions with Related Parties See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, of this report for information regarding transactions with related parties.
1495320_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement, which bear interest at variable rates.
1495320_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The amended and restated credit agreement allows for a revolving credit commitment of $125.0 million, bearing interest at a variable rate, based on either LIBOR plus the applicable margin (ranging from 1.05% to 2.05%) or the alternate base rate (as defined in the agreement) plus the applicable margin (ranging from 0.05% to 1.05%).
1495320_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Assuming borrowings available under the amended and restated credit agreement are fully extended, each quarter point increase or decrease in the interest rate would change our annual interest expense by approximately $0.3 million.
1495320_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Impact of Inflation Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost.
1495320_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Although it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial.
1495320_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We source a majority of our materials from various suppliers in China and South Korea.
1495320_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Substantially all purchases and sales involving foreign persons are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore we do not hedge using any derivative instruments.
1495320_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Historically, we have not been impacted materially by changes in exchange rates.

1495320_15_ITEM8_P2_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Vera Bradley, Inc. and subsidiaries at January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P2_S4	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Vera Bradley, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 31, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1495320_15_ITEM8_P4_S1	Vera Bradley, Inc. and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P4_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1495320_15_ITEM8_P4_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P4_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P4_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P5_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P5_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P5_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P5_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P5_S4	In our opinion, Vera Bradley, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.

1495320_15_ITEM8_P6_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vera Bradley, Inc.:

1495320_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	Description of the Company Vera Bradley is a leading designer of women s handbags and accessories, luggage and travel items, eyewear, and stationery and gifts.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P16_S1	Founded in 1982 by friends Barbara Bradley Baekgaard and Patricia R. Miller, the brand s iconic designs and versatile styles offer women of all ages a colorful way to accessorize every look.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P16_S2	Vera Bradley offers a unique, multi-channel sales model, as well as a focus on service and a high level of customer engagement.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P16_S3	The Company sells its products through two reportable segments: Direct and Indirect.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P16_S4	The Direct business consists of sales of Vera Bradley products through the Company s full-line and factory outlet stores in the United States, verabradley.com, direct-to-consumer eBay sales, and the Company's annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P16_S5	As of January 31, 2015 , the Company operated 96 full-line stores and 29 factory outlet stores.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	The Indirect business consists of sales of Vera Bradley products to approximately 2,700 specialty retail locations, substantially all of which are located in the United States, as well as department stores, national accounts, third party e-commerce sites, the Company's wholesale business in Japan, and third party inventory liquidation.

1495320_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	The Company has eliminated intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P18_S2	The Company utilizes a 52 - 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P18_S3	As such, fiscal year 2015 ended on January 31, 2015 , and reflected a 52 -week period; fiscal year 2014 ended on February 1, 2014 , and reflected a 52 -week period; fiscal year 2013 ended on February 2, 2013 , and reflected a 53 -week period.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P18_S4	The inclusion of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2013 resulted in incremental revenues of approximately $4.9 million and approximately $0.02 per diluted share.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the Company s assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosures relating to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	Significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include the valuation of inventories, accounts receivable valuation allowances, sales return allowances, and the useful lives of assets for depreciation or amortization.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P19_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P19_S3	The Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P19_S4	Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

1495320_15_ITEM8_P20_S2	The Company monitors the credit standing of this financial institution on a regular basis.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P21_S2	Market is determined based on net realizable value, which includes costs to dispose.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P21_S3	Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excess quantities, and other factors, including the popularity of a pattern or product, in evaluating net realizable value.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are carried at cost and depreciated or amortized over the following estimated useful lives using the straight-line method:
1495320_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the asset or the lease term.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P23_S1	Lease terms typically range from five to ten years.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	When a decision is made to abandon property, plant, and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life, depreciation or amortization estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P24_S1	At the time of disposal, the cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting loss is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	Property, plant, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P25_S1	The reviews are conducted at the lowest identifiable level of cash flows.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the property, plant, and equipment are less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, as further defined below in Fair Value of Financial Instruments.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	Routine maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with acquiring, modifying, and installing internal-use software.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P28_S1	Capitalized costs are included in property, plant, and equipment and are amortized over three to five years .
1495320_15_ITEM8_P28_S2	Software costs that do not meet capitalization criteria are expensed as incurred.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Revenue from the sale of the Company s products is recognized upon customer receipt of the product when collection of the associated receivables is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and ownership and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, which, for e-commerce and most Indirect sales, reflects an adjustment for shipments that customers have not yet received.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P29_S1	The adjustment of these shipments is based on actual delivery dates to the customer.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Included in net revenues are product sales to Direct and Indirect customers, including amounts billed to customers for shipping fees.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	Costs related to shipping of product are classified in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P30_S2	Net revenues exclude sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	Historical experience provides the Company the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of product sales that customers will return.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	Product returns are often resalable through the Company s annual outlet sale or other channels.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P31_S2	The Company accounts for anticipated returns by reducing net revenues and cost of sales and increasing inventories and other accrued liabilities, essentially reversing the effects of the original sales transactions.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P31_S3	Additionally, the Company reserves for other potential product credits granted to Indirect retailers.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P31_S4	The returns and credits reserve and the related activity for each fiscal year presented were as follows (in thousands):
1495320_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and customer-specific identification and believes that collections of receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, are reasonably assured.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $0.3 million at both January 31, 2015 , and February 1, 2014 .
1495320_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company sells gift cards with no expiration dates to customers and does not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P33_S1	Gift cards issued by the Company are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed, at which point revenue is recognized.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P33_S2	In addition, the Company recognizes revenue on unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Company determined the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 , the Company recorded $1.4 million of revenue related to gift card breakage.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P34_S2	Gift card breakage is included in net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income, as well as Direct segment sales; however, it is not included in the comparable sales figures.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes material and labor costs, freight, inventory shrinkage, operating lease costs, duty, and other operating expenses, including depreciation of the Company s distribution center and equipment.

1495320_15_ITEM8_P36_S1	For each of these leases, the Company recognizes the related rent expense on a straight-line basis commencing on the date of initial possession of the leased property.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P36_S2	The Company records the difference between the recognized rent expense and the amount payable under the lease as a deferred rent liability.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P36_S3	As of January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014 , deferred rent liability was $8.9 million and $7.0 million , respectively, and is included within other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company receives tenant-improvement allowances from some of the landlords of its leased properties.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P37_S1	These allowances generally are in the form of cash received by the Company from its landlords as part of the negotiated lease terms.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P37_S2	The Company records each tenant-improvement allowance as a deferred credit and amortizes the allowance on a straight-line basis as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease, commencing on the possession date.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P37_S3	As of January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014 , the deferred lease credit liability was $13.8 million and $10.3 million , respectively.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P37_S4	Of this, $1.8 million and $1.4 million is included within other accrued liabilities and $12.0 million and $8.9 million is included within other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014 , respectively.

1495320_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair-value recognition provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 718, Stock Compensation .
1495320_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	Under these provisions, for its awards of restricted stock and restricted-stock units, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the respective award.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P39_S2	The Company recognizes this expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
1495320_15_ITEM8_P39_S3	Other Income and Advertising Costs The Company expenses advertising costs at the time the promotion first appears in media, in stores, or on the website, and includes those costs in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

1495320_16_ITEM1_P18_S4	Our long-term strategic plan is centered upon the three planks of product, distribution, and marketing.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P18_S5	We call our target aspirational customer the Day Maker.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P18_S6	She is organized, thoughtful and, most of all, appreciates femininity and beauty - in color, print and thoughtful details.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P18_S7	We are focused on creating beautiful solutions for the Day Maker and believe we have a great opportunity to attract more Day Makers to our brand through our product offerings, our distribution channels, and our marketing efforts.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P18_S8	We have identified five key businesses where we can offer the Day Maker beautiful solutions that we believe will propel our future growth.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P18_S9	We are optimizing our existing core product portfolio and expanding into relevant new categories.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P18_S10	We will continue to use licenses and strategic partnerships as appropriate to expand our product categories.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our Fashion Bag and Accessories business continues to be our largest opportunity and allows us to showcase our innovation, function, and fashion.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Travel remains a core differentiator for Vera Bradley and allows us to both embrace our heritage and to showcase newness and functionality with products like Lighten Up and our unique collapsible luggage.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our Campus business has been successful, and we believe further expansion of our Collegiate Collection will help continue to propel our Campus authority forward.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	Wellness and Beauty is a growing category as our Day Maker is looking for experiential events and wants to find wellness and beauty products that enhance her holistically.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	Our recent home and body fragrance launch and our current line of multi-purpose sport bags play into this theme.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	We believe Home can continue to be a significant growth opportunity for Vera Bradley, with market attractiveness and a great brand fit.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Day Maker s fashion statement is often her home.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	In each of these areas, fabric, pattern innovation, and newness remain critical in order to stay relevant.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	Vera Bradley products are available wherever our consumer chooses to shop including via full-line and factory outlet stores, online, and department and specialty retail stores.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	We continue to focus on tightly integrating our multi-channel business by growing our Direct distribution channel (including full-line stores, factory outlet stores, and e-commerce), further developing our department store and other Indirect channel relationships and right-sizing and working to strengthen the performance in our specialty retail channel.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P25_S2	In 2007 and 2009, we opened our first full-line and factory outlet stores, respectively.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P25_S3	We believe there are ample opportunities for new stores throughout the United States and that we could eventually have up to 300 full-line and 100 factory outlet Vera Bradley stores.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P25_S4	We added 15 new full-line and 11 new factory outlet stores in fiscal 2016, but based on recent comparable store sales trends, we have slowed our short-term plans for new store openings.

1495320_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Seasonality Because Vera Bradley products are frequently given as gifts, we have historically realized, and expect to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of November and December.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	Channels of Distribution We distribute our products through our Direct and Indirect segments.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	This multi-channel distribution model is designed to enable operational flexibility and maximizes the methods by which we can access potential customers.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	We have developed a retail presence through our full-line stores, all located in the United States, which provides us with a format to showcase our brand and the full array of Vera Bradley products.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	As of January 30, 2016 , we operated 110 full-line stores averaging approximately 1,900 square feet per store.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P48_S2	Our sales associates are passionate about our products and customer service, which, we believe, translates into a superior shopping experience.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P48_S3	Our factory outlet stores are a vehicle for selling factory exclusive styles, as well as retired merchandise at discounted prices, while maintaining brand integrity.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P48_S4	At the end of fiscal 2016 , nearly 70% of the merchandise found in our factory outlet stores was factory exclusive styles.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	We believe our factory outlet stores are an integral part of our distribution strategy, as this format provides an additional channel of distribution for our products and enables us to better target value-oriented customers.

1495320_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	As of January 30, 2016 , we operated 40 factory outlet stores.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P49_S3	Our store location decisions for both full-line and factory outlet stores are made based upon our comprehensive retail strategy that includes actual and planned penetration in both Indirect and Direct segments, as well as existing e-commerce demand.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P49_S4	At this time, we do not believe any geographical market has been fully penetrated by our distribution channels.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P49_S5	We believe that expansion of our store base complements our Indirect segment by increasing brand awareness and reinforcing our brand image.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	In addition to analyzing store economics, we pay particular attention to the location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	Along with seeking co-tenants that we believe share our target customer, we seek a balanced mix of moderate and high-end retailers to encourage high levels of traffic.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P50_S2	Our target full-line store size is approximately 1,800 square feet, but we are able to work with spaces as small as 1,000 square feet or, depending on our market strategy and relevant economic factors, spaces as large as 2,800 square feet.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P50_S3	Our target factory outlet store size is approximately 3,000 square feet.

1495320_16_ITEM1_P50_S6	Our customer service philosophy emphasizes friendly service, merchandise knowledge, and passion for the brand.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P50_S7	Consequently, an essential requirement for the success of our stores is our ability to attract, train, and retain talented, highly motivated district managers, store managers, and sales associates.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P50_S8	We expect our new full-line stores to average approximately 1,800 square feet per store, and we expect to invest approximately $0.4 million per new store, consisting of inventory costs, pre-opening costs, and build-out costs, less tenant-improvement allowances.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P50_S9	New full-line stores generate, on average, approximately $0.8 million in net revenues during the first twelve months, and the payback on our investment is expected to occur in less than 22 months.

1495320_16_ITEM1_P50_S13	The objective of verabradley.com is to provide both a mechanism for marketing directly to consumers and a storefront where consumers can find the entire full-line Vera Bradley collection.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P50_S14	In fiscal 2013, we invested in upgrades to our website allowing for a more user friendly homepage, enabling us to ship internationally to 15 countries, and enhancing the checkout experience.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P50_S15	In fiscal 2015, we made additional enhancements to our website, including adding product recommendations, enhancing product descriptions, adding silhouettes for product scale, generating cart and site abandonment emails, and gathering and analyzing customer feedback.

1495320_16_ITEM1_P50_S17	We had approximately 59 million visits to verabradley.com during fiscal 2016 .
1495320_16_ITEM1_P50_S18	To continue to enhance our website engagement, we plan to complete a redesign and conversion of our website to a new platform in the fall of fiscal 2017.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	Our annual outlet sale is held in the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum Exposition Center in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	The annual outlet sale is an important tradition for Vera Bradley, has many loyal followers, and is an opportunity for us to sell our retired merchandise at discounted prices in a brand-right fashion.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P51_S2	We attracted approximately 55,000 attendees to our 2015 annual outlet sale.

1495320_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	No single account represented more than 10% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2016 , with the top ten accounts representing in the aggregate approximately 30% of total Indirect net revenues.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	The majority of our Indirect retailers have been customers for over five years.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P53_S3	In fiscal 2012, we launched our products in the department store channel.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P53_S4	Since spring 2015, we have nearly doubled our department store presence to about 620 locations, which includes 250 Macy's stores.

1495320_16_ITEM1_P53_S6	We believe that having an in-house field sales force results in more consistent brand presentation and messaging, enhanced support for our Indirect customers, and a more predictable, scalable, and cost-efficient business model.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P53_S7	As of January 30, 2016 , our sales team consisted of approximately 50 in-house, full-time sales consultants.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P53_S8	The compensation structure for our sales consultants consists of a combination of fixed pay and sales-based incentives.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P53_S9	In addition to acquiring new and growing existing accounts, our sales consultants serve as a support center for our Indirect customers by assisting and educating them in areas such as merchandising and visual presentation, marketing the brand, product selection, and inventory management.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P53_S10	Our visual merchandising program provides our sales consultants with a framework to guide our Indirect customers regarding optimal product placement and display that is intended to reinforce the message that our brand is distinct from those of our competitors.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	Manufacturing and Supply Chain Model Our multi-country manufacturing and supply chain model is designed to achieve efficient, timely, and accurate order fulfillment while maintaining appropriate levels of inventory.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	Our manufacturing and sourcing strategy is part of the larger cross-functional product development process.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P54_S2	The overall objective for our sourcing team is to build and sustain collaborative partnerships throughout our supply chain, with a focus on identifying appropriate countries and partners to manufacture our products.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P54_S3	The sourcing team leverages its expertise in negotiation, relationship management, and change management to maintain a strong global supply chain.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P54_S4	We strive to maintain the appropriate balance of inventory to enable us to provide a high level of service to our customers, including prompt and accurate delivery of our products.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P54_S5	We have an active and nimble sales and operations planning process that helps us balance the supply and demand issues that we encounter in our business, optimize our inventory levels, and anticipate inventory needs.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P54_S6	We have also integrated our planning, forecasting, and segmentation processes under one function called Merchandise Planning and Allocation.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	Approximately half of our products are cotton-based.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	Our other fabrics include nylon, polyester, microfiber, leather, and faux leather.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P55_S2	We source our materials from various suppliers in Asia, with the majority coming from China and South Korea.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P55_S3	Our global sourcing team works with select suppliers enabling us to optimize the mix of cost, lead time, quality, and reliability within our global supply network.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P55_S4	All of our suppliers must comply with our quality standards, and we use only a limited number of pre-approved suppliers who have demonstrated a commitment to delivering the highest quality products.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P55_S5	In December 2008, we opened an office in Dongguan, China, which enables us to increase our control over the manufacturing and supply chain process and monitor compliance with our quality standards.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P55_S6	In April 2016, we plan to open an office in Hong Kong to lead the global supply chain in Asia, including the oversight of sourcing and procurement.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P55_S7	The majority of our finished goods products, not sourced through licenses or strategic partners, are manufactured overseas by a variety of global manufacturers located primarily in China; however, we are diversifying our manufacturing to include other countries such as Vietnam and Cambodia.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P55_S8	We are not dependent upon any single manufacturer for our products.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P55_S9	When determining the size of orders placed with our manufacturers, we take into account forward-looking demand, lead times for specific products, current inventory levels, and minimum order quantity requirements.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	Overseas production has resulted in substantial cost savings and a reduction of capital investment.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	With the oversight of our office in China and our independent contractors, we believe these financial benefits have been realized without sacrificing the level of quality inherent in our products or service to our customers.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	In 2007, we consolidated our warehousing and shipping functions into one distribution center, located in Roanoke, Indiana.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	In fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2015, we expanded the facility by 200,000 and 10,000 square-feet, respectively, which resulted in a total distribution center space of 428,500 square-feet.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	The expansion resulted in capacity gains in the areas of inbound receiving, inventory storage, order fulfillment, value-add processing and shipping.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	The facility s advanced technology enables us to more accurately process and pack orders, as well as track shipments and inventory.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P58_S2	We believe that our systems for the processing and shipment of orders from our distribution center have enabled us to improve our overall customer service through enhanced order accuracy and reduced turnaround time.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P58_S3	Our products are shipped primarily via FedEx and common carriers to our stores, our Indirect retailers and department stores, and directly to our customers who purchase through our website.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P58_S4	We believe we are positioned well to support the order fulfillment requirements of our business, including business generated through our website.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P58_S5	We believe that high levels of automation and technology are essential to maintain our competitive position.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P58_S6	We maintain computer hardware, systems applications, and networks to enhance and accelerate the design process, to support the sale and distribution of our products to our customers, and to improve the integration and efficiency of our operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P58_S7	Our management information systems are designed to provide, among other things, comprehensive order processing, production, accounting, and management information for the product development, retail, sales, marketing, distribution, finance, and human resources functions of our business.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P58_S8	We use several systems, including MICROS-Retail, SAP, JDA, and SCALE for our information technology requirements.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	Competition We face strong competition in each of the product lines and markets in which we compete.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	We believe that all of our products are in similar competitive positions with respect to the number of competitors they face and the level of competition within each product line.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	Due to the number of different products we offer, it is not practicable for us to quantify the number of competitors we face.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P59_S3	Our products compete with other branded products within their product categories and with private label products sold by retailers.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P59_S4	In our Indirect business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers, and distributors of handbags, accessories, and other products for the limited space available for the display of such products to the consumer.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P59_S5	Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	In our Direct business, we compete against other independent retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, gift retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	The market for handbags, in particular, is highly competitive.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P60_S2	Our competitors include not only established companies that are expanding their production and marketing of handbags, but also frequent new entrants to the market.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P60_S3	We directly compete with wholesalers and direct sellers of branded handbags and accessories, such as Coach, Michael Kors, Nine West, Dooney Bourke, Kate Spade, Fossil, Brahmin, and Tory Burch.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P60_S4	In varying degrees, depending on the product category involved, we compete on the basis of design (aesthetic appeal), quality (construction), function, price point, distribution, and brand positioning.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P60_S5	We believe that our primary competitive advantages are consumer recognition of our brand, customer loyalty, product development expertise, and our widespread presence through our multi-channel distribution model.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P60_S6	Some of our competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources than we do.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P60_S7	Further, we may face new competitors and increased competition from existing competitors as we expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	Copyrights and Trademarks The development of new patterns includes the design of primary and secondary prints.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P61_S1	Once developed, we generally copyright our patterns as appropriate.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P61_S2	We currently have approximately 780 copyrights.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P61_S3	We also own all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing, and distribution of all of our products, both in the United States and in the other countries in which our products are principally sold.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P61_S4	We aggressively police our trademarks and copyrights and pursue infringers and counterfeiters both domestically and internationally.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P61_S5	Our trademarks will remain in existence for as long as we continue to use and renew them in advance of their expiration dates.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	Employees As of January 30, 2016 , we had approximately 2,950 employees.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	Of the total, 2,330 were engaged in retail selling positions, 300 were engaged in distribution, sourcing and quality functions, 35 were engaged in product design, and 285 were engaged in corporate support and administrative functions.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P62_S2	None of our employees are represented by a union.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P62_S3	We believe that our relations with our employees are good, and we have never encountered a significant work stoppage.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P62_S4	Many of our imported products are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs, or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the United States and other countries or impact the cost of such products.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P62_S5	To date, we have not been restricted by quotas in the operation of our business, and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of a majority of our products.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P62_S6	In addition, we are subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions, including U.S. retaliation against prohibited foreign practices, with respect to our product sourcing and international sales operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P62_S7	We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental matters, including the handling, transportation, and disposal of our products and our non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, and groundwater.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P62_S8	Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties, or the imposition of other liabilities.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect upon our earnings or financial position.
1495320_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	If we violate any laws or regulations, however, it could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance.

1495320_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	If we are unable to successfully implement our long-term strategic plan and growth strategies, our future operating results could suffer.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	In fiscal 2015, we began to implement a long-term strategic plan focused on product, distribution and marketing strategies intended to profitably grow our business.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The success of our long-term strategic plan and these growth strategies, alone or collectively, will depend on various factors, including the appeal of our product designs, retail presentation to consumers, effectiveness of our marketing initiatives, competitive conditions, and economic conditions.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our strategic plan.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If we are unsuccessful in implementing some or all of our strategies or initiatives, our future operating results could be adversely impacted.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Changes in general economic conditions, and their impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Consumer confidence and consumer spending may be influenced by fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, changing fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, levels of unemployment and consumer debt levels, changes in net worth based on market conditions, general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment, and weather and weather-related phenomena.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty, and this could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	In the event that the U.S. economy worsens, or if there is a decline in consumer-spending levels or other unfavorable conditions, including inflation, we could experience lower than expected net revenues, which could force us to delay or slow the implementation of our growth strategies and adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our inability to predict and respond in a timely manner to changes in consumer demand could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Our success depends on our ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies consumer demand in a timely manner.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P2_S7	We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to develop appealing patterns and styles or meet changing consumer demands in the future.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P2_S8	If we misjudge the market for our products, we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P2_S9	In addition, changes to our product assortment and to our available fabrications, as well as the availability and breadth of pattern assortment may not gain consumer acceptance.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Merchandise misjudgments could adversely impact our net revenues and results of operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P2_S11	We may continue to experience declines in comparable sales and there can be no guarantee that the strategic initiatives we are implementing to improve our results will be successful.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P2_S12	We may not be able to regain the levels of comparable sales that we have experienced in the past and comparable sales may also further deteriorate.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P2_S13	If our future comparable sales fail to meet market expectations, then the price of our common stock could decline.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P2_S14	Also, the aggregate results of operations of our stores have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P2_S15	Numerous factors influence comparable sales, including fashion trends, competition, national and regional economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, marketing programs, changes in consumer shopping trends, site selection strategy, and weather conditions.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P2_S16	These factors may cause our comparable sales results to be lower in the future than in recent periods or lower than expectations, either of which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If our multi-channel distribution model is not successful, our business and results of operations may suffer.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	wholesale business in Japan, and third party inventory liquidators.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	These channels are sometimes in direct competition and sales through these channels may not be incremental to total sales.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We may not be able to successfully open new stores and/or operate new and current stores as planned, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Our future growth will depend on our ability to successfully open and operate new and current stores.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We plan to open approximately 10 new stores during fiscal 2017, and additional new stores each year thereafter.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Our ability to successfully open and operate stores depends on many factors, including our ability to:
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	successfully integrate new stores into our existing operations and information technology systems.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The success of new store openings may also be affected by our ability to initiate marketing efforts in advance of opening our first store in a particular region.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Additionally, we will incur pre-opening costs and we may encounter initial losses while new stores commence operations, which could strain our resources and adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business depends on a strong brand.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If we are unable to execute our brand strategy, intended to enhance our brand, then we may be unable to sell our products, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We believe that the brand image that we have developed has contributed significantly to the success of our business.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We also believe that enhancing the Vera Bradley brand through our new brand strategy is critical to maintaining and expanding our customer base.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Enhancing our brand and implementing our new brand strategy may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as product design, store operations, store design, community relations, and marketing.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P6_S5	If we are unable to successfully execute our brand strategy, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Our results of operations could suffer if we lose key management or design associates or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Our performance depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and product development teams.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P6_S8	These executives and design associates have substantial experience in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P6_S9	Although we have entered into an employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, we may not be able to retain his services or those of other key individuals in the future.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P6_S10	The unexpected loss of services of key employees could have adverse impacts on our business and results of operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P6_S11	As our business grows and we open new stores, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees and develop, train, and manage an increasing number of management-level, sales, and other employees.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P6_S12	Competition for qualified employees is intense.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P6_S13	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain employees as needed in the future.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P6_S14	Our results of operations are subject to quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P6_S15	Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including, among other things:
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	timing of new pattern and collection releases and new product introductions.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Any quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	This could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	A data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, expose us to litigation risk and adversely affect our business.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We are dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet, for a significant portion of our sales, primarily through our e-commerce operations and credit card transaction authorization and processing.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We are also responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our e-commerce websites and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	As part of our normal course of business, we often collect, retain, and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information, over public networks.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	There is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Despite the security measures we currently have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Any electronic or physical security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, including penetration of our network security, whether by us or by a third-party, could disrupt our business, severely damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, expose us to risks of litigation and liability and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We do not control third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will not occur in the future.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility, reduce our e-commerce net sales, impair our ability to attract website visitors and reduce our ability to attract and retain customers.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P10_S5	We may also incur significant costs in complying with the various applicable state, federal and foreign laws regarding unauthorized disclosure of personal information.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P10_S7	We are dependent on our computer systems to record and process transactions and manage and operate our business, including in designing, marketing, manufacturing, importing, tracking and distributing our products, processing payments, and accounting for and reporting results.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P10_S8	We also utilize an automated replenishment system to facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders, the movement of goods through distribution channels, and the collection of information for planning and forecasting.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P10_S9	In addition, we have an e-commerce website in the U.S. Given the complexity of our business and the significant number of transactions that we engage in on an annual basis, it is imperative that we maintain constant operation of our computer hardware and software systems.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P10_S10	Despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from, among other things, security breaches, computer viruses or power outages.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P10_S11	Any material disruptions in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We are exposed to business risks as a result of our e-commerce operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We operate an e-commerce store at www.verabradley.com.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Expanding our e-commerce business is one of the key objectives of our business strategy.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Our e-commerce operations are subject to numerous risks, including unanticipated operating problems, reliance on third-party computer hardware and software providers, system failures and the need to invest in additional computer systems.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Specific risks include: (i) diversion of sales from our stores; (ii) rapid technological change; (iii) liability for e-commerce content; (iv) risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate the websites and their related support systems, including from computer viruses, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions; and (v) failure to properly and smoothly launch the Company s new e-commerce platform scheduled in the fall of fiscal 2017.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Internet operations involve risks which may be beyond our control that could have a direct material adverse effect on our operating results, including: (i) price competition involving the items we intend to sell; (ii) the entry of our vendors into the Internet business in direct competition with us; (iii) the level of merchandise returns experienced by us; (iv) governmental regulation; (v) e-commerce security breaches involving unauthorized access to our and/or customer information; (vi) credit card fraud; and (vii) competition and general economic conditions specific to the Internet, e-commerce and the accessories industry.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Our inability to effectively address these risks and any other risks that we face in connection with our Internet operations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Closing stores could result in significant costs to us.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Since December 2014, we have closed two underperforming stores and could, in the future, decide to close additional stores that are producing losses or that are not as profitable as we expect.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P11_S9	If we decide to close any stores before the expiration of their lease terms, we may incur payments to landlords to terminate or buy out the remaining term of the lease.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	costs related to the employees at such stores, whether or not we terminate the leases early.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Upon any such closure, the closing costs, including fixed assets and inventory write-downs, could adversely affect our results and could adversely affect our cash on hand.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our Company's ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping centers in which many of our stores are located.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Substantially all of our Direct stores are located in regional mall shopping centers and many of our Indirect customers are also located in these shopping centers.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Factors beyond our control impact mall traffic, such as general economic conditions and consumer spending levels.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Consumer spending and mall traffic have been depressed in recent years.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	As a result, mall operators have been facing increasing operational and financial difficulties.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The increasing inability of mall anchor tenants and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic around our stores, the increasing inability of mall operators to attract anchor tenants and maintain viable operations and the increasing departures of existing anchor and other mall tenants due to declines in the sales volume and in the popularity of certain malls as shopping destinations, have reduced and may continue to reduce our sales volume and, consequently, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We lease all of our store locations.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We typically occupy our stores under operating leases with terms of ten years.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We have been able to negotiate favorable rental rates in recent years due in part to the state of the economy and high vacancy rates within some shopping centers, but there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to negotiate such favorable terms.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Some of our leases have early cancellation clauses, which permit the lease to be terminated by us or the landlord if certain sales levels are not met in specific periods or if the shopping center does not meet specified occupancy standards.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P15_S5	In addition to requiring future minimum lease payments, some of our store leases provide for the payment of common area maintenance charges, real property insurance, and real estate taxes.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Many of our lease agreements have escalating rent provisions over the initial term and any extensions.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P15_S7	As we expand our store base, our lease expense and our cash outlays for rent under lease agreements will increase.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including:
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	limiting our ability to obtain additional financing.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Any of these consequences could place us at a disadvantage with respect to our competitors.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We depend on cash flow from operating activities to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses and needs, we may not be able to service our lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would harm our business.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Additional sites that we lease may be subject to long-term non-cancelable leases if we are unable to negotiate our current standard lease terms.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, including paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Moreover, even if a lease has an early cancellation clause, we may not satisfy the contractual requirements for early cancellation under the lease.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Our inability to enter new leases or renew existing leases on acceptable terms or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that we close would, in any such case, affect us adversely.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our failure to effectively compete with other retailers for sales could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The market for bags, accessories, and travel items is increasingly competitive.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	establishing and maintaining good working relationships with our Indirect retailers.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In our Indirect business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers, and distributors of handbags, accessories, and other products for the limited space available for the display of such products to the consumer.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In our Direct business, we compete against other gift and specialty retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In addition, in light of a continued difficult consumer environment, pricing is a significant driver of consumer choice in our industry and we regularly engage in price competition, particularly through our promotional programs.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P20_S5	To the extent that we decrease our promotional activity, our ability to maintain sales levels may be impacted.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P20_S6	We rely on various contract manufacturers to produce all of our products and generally do not have long-term contracts with our manufacturers.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P20_S7	Disruptions in our contract manufacturers systems, losses of manufacturing certifications, or other actions by these manufacturers could increase our cost of sales, adversely affect our net revenues, and injure our reputation and customer relationships, thereby harming our business.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Our various contract manufacturers produce all of our products.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P20_S9	We generally do not enter into long-term formal written agreements with our manufacturers and instead transact business with each of them on an order-by-order basis.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P20_S10	In the event of a disruption in our contract manufacturers systems, we may be unable to locate alternative manufacturers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P20_S11	Identifying a suitable manufacturer is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with the prospective manufacturer s quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability, labor practices and environmental compliance.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P20_S12	Any delay, interruption, or increased cost in the manufactured products that might occur for any reason, such as the lack of long-term contracts or regulatory requirements and the loss of certifications, power interruptions, fires, hurricanes, war, or threats of terrorism, could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products, adversely affect our net revenues, increase our cost of sales, and hurt our results of operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P20_S13	In addition, manufacturing disruption could injure our reputation and customer relationships, thereby harming our business.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We rely on various suppliers to supply a significant majority of our raw materials.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Disruption in the supply of raw materials could increase our cost of goods sold and if there are not sufficient raw materials available to meet product demand, our product revenue could decline.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We generally do not enter into long-term formal written agreements with our suppliers and typically transact business with each of them on an order-by-order basis.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	In the event of a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from our current sources, we may not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P21_S4	In such a case, we could have difficulty meeting consumer demand and net revenues could be adversely impacted.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We rely on a single distribution facility for all of the products we sell.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Disruption to that facility could adversely impact our results of operations, and expansion of that facility could have unpredictable adverse effects.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Our distribution operations are currently concentrated in a single, company-owned distribution center in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Any significant disruption in the operation of the facility due to natural disaster or severe weather, or events such as fire, accidents, power outages, system failures, or other unforeseen causes, could devalue or damage a significant portion of our inventory and could adversely affect our product distribution and sales until such time as we could secure an alternative facility.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	If we encounter difficulties with our distribution facility or other problems or disasters arise, we cannot ensure that critical systems and operations will be restored in a timely manner or at all, and this would have a material adverse effect on our business.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P22_S5	In addition, our growth could require us to further expand our current facility, which could affect us adversely in ways that we cannot predict.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P22_S6	The cost of raw materials could increase our cost of sales and cause our results of operations to suffer.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Fluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of fabrics or other raw materials used to manufacture our products, as well as the price for labor, marketing, and transportation, could have adverse impacts on our cost of sales and our ability to meet our customers demands.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P22_S8	In particular, fluctuations in the price of cotton, our primary raw material, could have an adverse impact on our cost of sales.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P22_S9	In addition, because a key component of our products is petroleum-based, the cost of oil affects the cost of our products.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P22_S10	Upward movement in the price of oil in the global oil markets would also likely result in rising fuel and freight prices, which could increase our shipping costs.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P22_S11	In the future, we may not be able to pass all or a portion of higher costs on to our customers.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing and manufacturing activities.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We source our fabrics primarily from manufacturers in China and South Korea and outsource the production of a significant majority of our products to companies in Asia.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We are subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing and manufacturing, including, but not limited to:
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	natural disasters, acts of war and terrorism, changing macroeconomic trends, and other external factors over which we have no control.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Additionally, we do not have complete oversight over our contract manufacturers.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Violation of labor or other laws by those manufacturers, or the divergence of a contract manufacturer s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States or in other markets in which we may in the future do business, could also draw negative publicity for us and our brand, diminishing the value of our brand and reducing demand for our products.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Our ability to source our products at favorable prices, or at all, could be harmed, with adverse effects on our results of operations, if new trade restrictions are imposed or if existing trade restrictions become more burdensome.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	A significant majority of our products are currently manufactured for us in Asia.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The United States and the countries in which our products are produced have imposed and may impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or regulations or may adversely adjust prevailing quotas, duties, or tariffs.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Countries impose, modify, and remove tariffs and other trade restrictions in response to a diverse array of factors, including global and national economic and political conditions, which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other trade restrictions.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Trade restrictions, which include embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us or could require us to modify supply chain organization or other current business practices, any of which could harm our results of operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	We may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Currently, none of our employees are represented by a union.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Nevertheless, our employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to organize or affiliate with a union.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P26_S6	If some or all of our workforce were to become unionized, our business would be exposed to work stoppages and slowdowns as a unionized business.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P26_S7	If, in addition, the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly more favorable to union workers than our current pay-and-benefits arrangements, our costs would increase and our results of operations would suffer.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P26_S8	We rely on independent transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We currently rely on independent transportation service providers for substantially all of our product shipments.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our utilization of these delivery services, or those of any other shipping companies that we may elect to use, is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, employee strikes and inclement weather, which may impact the shipping company s ability to provide delivery services sufficient to meet our shipping needs.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	If for any reason we were to change shipping companies, we could face logistical difficulties that might adversely affect deliveries, and we would incur costs and expend resources in the course of making the change.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Moreover, we might not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from the service providers that we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P27_S4	We also would face shipping and distribution risks and uncertainties associated with any expansion of our distribution facility and related systems.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our inability or failure to protect our intellectual property or our infringement of other s intellectual property could have a negative impact on our operating results.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We believe that our registered copyrights, registered and common law trademarks, and other proprietary rights have significant value and are critical to our ability to create and sustain demand for our products.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Although we have not been inhibited from selling our products in connection with intellectual property disputes, we cannot assure you that obstacles will not arise as we expand our product line and extend our brand as well as the geographic scope of our sales and marketing.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We also cannot assure you that the actions taken by us to establish and protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products or infringement of our rights by others.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P28_S4	The legal regimes of some foreign countries, particularly China, may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by others in these countries.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P28_S5	The loss of copyrights, trademarks, and other proprietary rights could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P28_S6	Any litigation regarding our proprietary rights could be time consuming and costly.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P28_S7	We are also subject to the risk that claims will be brought against us for infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties, seeking to block the sale of our products considered to violate their intellectual property rights or payment of monetary amounts.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P28_S8	In particular, we are subject to copyright infringement claims for which we may not be entitled to indemnification from our suppliers.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P28_S9	In addition, in recent years, companies in the retail industry, including us, have been subject to patent infringement claims from non-practicing entities, or patent trolls.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P28_S10	Any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming and result in costly litigation.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P28_S11	As a result, any such claim, or the combination of multiple claims, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P28_S12	If we are required to stop using any of our registered or nonregistered trademarks, our sales could decline and, consequently, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P28_S13	Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results and stock price.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We are subject to income taxes in many U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which includes reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Further, possible changes in federal, state, local, and non-U.S. tax laws bearing upon our revenues, income, property, or other aspects of our operations or business would, if enacted, affect our results of operations in ways and to a degree that we cannot currently predict.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We have recorded asset impairment charges in the past and we may record material asset impairment charges in the future.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Quarterly, we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	If we determine that the carrying value of long-lived assets is not recoverable, we will be required to record impairment charges relating to those assets.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	For example, our assessments during fiscal 2016 indicated that operating losses or insufficient operating income existed at certain retail stores, with a projection that the operating losses or insufficient operating income for those locations would continue.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P32_S3	As such, we recorded non-cash charges of $2.8 million during fiscal 2016 within asset impairment in the consolidated statements of operations to write down the carrying values of these stores' long-lived assets to their estimated fair values.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Our quarterly evaluation of store assets includes consideration of current and historical performance and projections of future profitability.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P32_S5	The profitability projections rely upon estimates made by us, including store-level sales, gross margins, and direct expenses, and, by their nature, include judgments about how current strategic initiatives will impact future performance.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P32_S6	If we are not able to achieve the projected key financial metrics for any reason, including because any of the strategic initiatives being implemented do not result in significant improvements in our current financial performance trend, this would indicate that the value of our long-lived assets was not recoverable and we would incur additional impairment of assets in the future.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P32_S7	In the event we record additional impairment charges, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our Indirect business could suffer as a result of decisions by our Indirect retailers to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We do not enter into long-term agreements with any of our Indirect retailers.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers for each of our lines every season.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S3	A decision by a significant number of Indirect retailers, whether motivated by competitive conditions, operational or financial difficulties, reduced access to capital, or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or to change their manner of doing business with us could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Although we recommend retail sale prices for our products to our Indirect retailers, we do not provide dealer allowances or other economic incentives to support those prices.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Possible promotional pricing or discounting by Indirect retailers in response to softening retail demand could have a negative effect on our brand image and prestige, which might be difficult to counteract as the economy improves.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S6	Bankruptcies or other operational or financial difficulties of our Indirect retailers could adversely impact our business.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S7	We sell our Indirect merchandise primarily to specialty retail and department stores across the United States and extend trade credit based on an evaluation of each Indirect retailer s financial condition, usually without requiring collateral.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S8	Perceived or actual financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer or could decrease demand for our products by that customer.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S9	Pending the resolution of a relationship with a financially troubled Indirect retailer, we might assume credit risk that we would otherwise avoid relating to our receivables from that customer.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S10	Inability to collect on accounts receivable from our Indirect retailers would adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S11	There are claims made against us from time to time that can result in litigation or regulatory proceedings, which could distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability or damage to our brand image.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S12	As a growing company with expanding operations, we increasingly face the risk of litigation and other claims against us.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S13	Litigation and other claims may arise in the ordinary course of our business and include employee claims, custom and duty claims, commercial disputes, intellectual property issues, product-oriented allegations, and slip and fall claims.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S14	Often these cases raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S15	Litigation and other claims against us could result in unexpected expenses and liability, as well as materially adversely affect our operations and our reputation.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S16	We may suffer negative publicity and our business may be harmed if we need to recall any products we sell.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S17	We have in the past needed to, and may in the future need to, recall products that we determine may present safety issues.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S18	If products we sell have safety problems of which we are not aware, or if we or the Consumer Product Safety Commission recall a product sold in our stores, we may suffer negative publicity and, potentially, product liability lawsuits, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations or cash flows.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S19	Risks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock Our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell shares at or above the price at which you purchase them.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P33_S20	The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	These and other factors may result in a lower market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	In addition, the stock markets, including The Nasdaq Global Select Market, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many retail companies.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P34_S3	If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Over the last few years, proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies in retail businesses.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We could become engaged in a consent solicitation, or proxy contest, or experience other stockholder activism, in the future.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Activist shareholders may advocate for certain governance and strategic changes at our company.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	In the event of stockholder activism, particularly with respect to matters which our Board of Directors, in exercising their fiduciary duties, disagree with or have determined not to pursue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management, and perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners and customers.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In addition, if faced with a consent solicitation or proxy contest, we may not be able to respond successfully to the contest or dispute, which would be disruptive to our business.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P37_S3	If individuals are elected to our Board with a differing agenda, our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders may be adversely affected.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P37_S4	A limited number of shareholders control a large percentage of the voting power of our common stock, and therefore investors may have limited ability to determine the outcome of shareholder votes.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P37_S5	Michael Ray (our former CEO and Ms. Bradley Baekgaard's son in-law), Robert Hall, Barbara Bradley Baekgaard, Joan Hall (Mr. Hall s wife and Ms. Bradley Baekgaard s daughter), Patricia R. Miller and P. Michael Miller, directly or indirectly, beneficially own and have the ability to exercise voting control over, in the aggregate, 43.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of January 30, 2016 .
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P37_S6	As a result, these shareholders are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, any amendments to our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and significant corporate transactions.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P37_S7	This concentrated ownership of outstanding common stock may limit your ability to influence corporate matters, and the interests of these shareholders may not coincide with our interests or your interests.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P37_S8	As a result, we may take actions that you do not believe to be in our interests or your interests and that could depress our stock price.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P37_S9	In addition, this significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock should investors perceive disadvantages in owning shares of common stock in a company that has such concentrated ownership.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	From time to time, we provide guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management s estimates as of the date of release.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in the release.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed, but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P39_S3	We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	farther in the future that the data are forecast.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Indiana law may discourage or prevent a change in control, even if a sale of the Company would be beneficial to our shareholders, which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by shareholders to replace or remove our current management.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control, discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock, harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	requiring advance notice for raising business matters or nominating directors at shareholders meetings.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	As permitted by our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, our board of directors also has the ability, should they so determine, to adopt a shareholder rights agreement, sometimes called a poison pill, providing for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common stock.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In the event of a takeover attempt, this preferred stock would give rights to holders of common stock (other than the potential acquirer) to buy additional shares of common stock at a discount, leading to the dilution of the potential acquirer s stake.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The adoption of a poison pill, or the board s ability to do so, can have negative effects such as those described above.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	As an Indiana corporation, we are governed by the Indiana Business Corporation Law (as amended from time to time, the IBCL ).
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Under specified circumstances, certain provisions of the IBCL related to control share acquisitions, business combinations and constituent interests may delay, prevent or make more difficult unsolicited acquisitions or changes of control of us.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P45_S2	These provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our management.
1495320_16_ITEM1A_P45_S3	It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that shareholders might deem to be in their best interest.
1495320_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	The expansion of this property during fiscal 2015, added approximately 149,000 square feet to the existing building, which now serves as the Company's corporate headquarters.
1495320_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	This showroom and office space was relocated in December 2015.
1495320_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	Subsequent to fiscal year end, we entered into an arrangement to lease 5,079 square feet of office space in Hong Kong.
1495320_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	As of January 30, 2016 , we also leased 155 store locations in the United States, including 5 store locations opened or to be opened in fiscal 2017.
1495320_16_ITEM2_P0_S4	See below for more information regarding the locations of our open stores as of January 30, 2016 .
1495320_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	We consider these properties to be in good condition generally and believe that our facilities are adequate for our operations and provide sufficient capacity to meet our anticipated requirements.
1495320_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	The properties in the above table are used by both the Direct segment and Indirect segment, excluding the three showrooms which are used exclusively by the Indirect segment.
1495320_16_ITEM2_P2_S0	Our full-line stores are located primarily in high-traffic regional malls, lifestyle centers, and mixed-use shopping centers across the United States.
1495320_16_ITEM2_P2_S1	The following table shows the number of full-line and factory outlet stores we operated in each state as of January 30, 2016 :
1495320_16_ITEM2_P3_S0	We lease all of our stores.
1495320_16_ITEM2_P3_S1	Lease terms generally range from five to ten years with options to renew for varying terms.
1495320_16_ITEM2_P3_S2	The leases generally provide for a fixed minimum rental plus contingent rent, which is determined as a percentage of sales in excess of specified levels.
1495320_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol VRA .
1495320_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices of our common stock, as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market, for each quarterly period in our two most recent fiscal years:
1495320_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of March 25, 2016, we had approximately 30 registered shareholders of record.
1495320_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	The number of shareholders of record is based upon the actual number of shareholders registered at such date and does not include holders of shares in street name or persons, partnerships, associations, corporations, or other entities identified in security position listings maintained by depositories.
1495320_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds On September 9, 2014, the Company s board of directors approved a share repurchase program (the 2014 Share Repurchase Program ) authorizing up to $40.0 million of repurchases of shares of the Company's common stock through October 2016.
1495320_16_ITEM5_P2_S1	The 2014 Share Repurchase Program was completed in August 2015.
1495320_16_ITEM5_P2_S2	On December 8, 2015, the Company s board of directors approved another share repurchase program (the 2015 Share Repurchase Program ) authorizing up to $50.0 million of repurchases of shares of the Company s common stock.
1495320_16_ITEM5_P2_S3	The 2015 Share Repurchase Program expires in December 2017.

1495320_16_ITEM5_P2_S5	Of these purchases, 283,354 shares at an average price of $14.64 per share, for an aggregate amount of $4.1 million , were purchased under the 2015 Share Repurchase Plan.
1495320_16_ITEM5_P2_S6	As of January 30, 2016 , there was $45.9 million remaining available to repurchase shares of the Company s common stock under the 2015 Share Repurchase Program.
1495320_16_ITEM5_P2_S7	Details on the shares repurchased under the program during the thirteen weeks ended January 30, 2016 are as follows:
1495320_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	Dividends Our common stock began trading on October 21, 2010, following our initial public offering.
1495320_16_ITEM5_P3_S1	Since that time, we have not declared any cash dividends, and we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1495320_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	Stock Performance Graph The graph set forth below compares the cumulative shareholder return on our common stock between January 29, 2011, and January 30, 2016 , to the cumulative return of (i) the S P 500 Index and (ii) the S P 500 Apparel, Accessories, and Luxury Goods Index over the same period.
1495320_16_ITEM5_P4_S1	This graph assumes an initial investment of $100 on January 29, 2011, in our common stock, the S P 500 Index, and the S P 500 Apparel, Accessories, and Luxury Goods Index and assumes the reinvestment of dividends, if any.

1495320_16_ITEM5_P9_S1	Japan was formerly included in the Direct segment results.
1495320_16_ITEM5_P9_S2	Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
1495320_16_ITEM5_P9_S3	(3) Includes full-line and factory outlet stores.
1495320_16_ITEM5_P9_S4	Our first full-line store opened in September 2007 and our first factory outlet store opened in November 2009.
1495320_16_ITEM5_P9_S5	(4) Comparable sales (including e-commerce) are calculated based upon our stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months and net revenues from our e-commerce operations.
1495320_16_ITEM5_P9_S6	Increase or decrease is reported as a percentage of the comparable sales for the same period in the prior fiscal year.
1495320_16_ITEM5_P9_S7	Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage.
1495320_16_ITEM5_P9_S8	Calculation excludes sales for the 53 rd week in fiscal 2013.
1495320_16_ITEM5_P10_S0	Average net revenues per gross square foot are calculated by dividing total net revenues for our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the period by total gross square footage for those stores.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	Executive summary Fiscal 2016 was the second year of our multi-year turnaround, and we made significant progress against key elements of our long-term strategic plan, laid out in March 2014, focusing on the key planks of product, distribution, and marketing.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	We made progress on our product strategies, including:
1495320_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Substantially enhancing our gross profit percentage through sourcing efficiencies, higher penetration of our Made for Outlet ( MFO ) product, and meaningfully reducing our promotional activity.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	We made progress on our distribution strategies, including:
1495320_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Nearly doubling our department store presence at Macy s, adding distribution at select Belk and Bon-Ton stores, and beginning our Amazon partnership.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	We began to modernize our marketing and increase brand and product awareness through:
1495320_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Introducing our Campus Ambassador program on several college campuses.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	Other charges affecting comparability were $3.1 million ( $2.1 million after the associated tax benefit) in fiscal 2016 .
1495320_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 totaled $26.3 millio n, which were funded from cash generated from operations of $43.3 million .
1495320_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	In June 2014, we entered into a five-year agreement with Mitsubishi Corporation Fashion Company and Look Inc. for the importation and distribution of Vera Bradley products in Japan.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	As a result of moving to this wholesale business model, we exited our direct business in Japan during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and have accounted for it as a discontinued operation.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Consolidated income statement and Direct segment results for the current and prior periods presented are reported on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise stated.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	Restructuring and Other Charges Affecting Comparability of the Year-to-Date Periods ended January 30, 2016, and January 31, 2015 In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company closed its manufacturing facility located in New Haven, Indiana.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	The Company incurred restructuring and other charges during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 of approximately $3.4 million ($2.1 million after the associated tax benefit), related to the facility closing, as compared to $3.0 million ($1.9 million after the associated tax benefit), primarily related to raw materials inventory write-downs, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P10_S3	The fiscal 2016 charges include severance and benefit costs of approximately $1.7 million, lease termination costs of approximately $0.7 million, inventory-related charges of approximately $0.6 million, and other associated net costs, which include accelerated depreciation related to fixed assets, of approximately $0.4 million.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P10_S4	These charges are reflected in cost of sales in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P10_S5	Management expects that the facility closure will reduce operating costs by approximately $12.0 million annually beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P10_S6	All production from the facility will be absorbed by the Company s third party manufacturing suppliers.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Additional charges affecting comparability of the financial results for the fifty-two weeks ended January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 totaled approximately $3.1 million ($2.1 million after the associated tax benefit) consisting of charges in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 of $1.3 million in employee severance (reflected in selling, general, and administrative expenses), $1.2 million due to a retail store early lease termination agreement (reflected in selling, general, and administrative expenses), and $0.6 million related to an increase in income tax reserves for uncertain federal and state tax positions related to research and development tax credits (reflected in income tax expense).
1495320_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	See Note 15 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, herein, for additional information.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	How We Assess the Performance of Our Business In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Net Revenues Net revenues reflect revenues from the sale of our merchandise and from distribution and shipping and handling fees, less returns and discounts.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	Revenues for the Direct segment reflect sales through our full-line and factory outlet stores, verabradley.com, direct-to-consumer eBay sales, and our annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	Revenues for the Indirect segment reflect sales to specialty retail partners, department stores, national accounts, third party e-commerce sites, our wholesale business in Japan, and third party inventory liquidators.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	As of January 30, 2016 , our specialty retail locations have decreased to approximately 2,600 locations from their peak during fiscal 2013 of approximately 3,600 locations.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	We believe hyper-promotional activity, which we define as discounts of 60% or more, has been damaging to our brand.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	Accordingly, we strategically reduced our use of this type of promotion both in our Direct stores and on verabradley.com during fiscal 2016.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Comparable Sales Comparable sales (including e-commerce) are calculated based upon our stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months and net revenues from our e-commerce operations.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	Comparable store sales are calculated based solely upon our stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales and comparable store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales differently than we do.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	As a result, data in this report regarding our comparable sales and comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other companies.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Non-comparable sales include sales from stores not included in comparable sales or comparable store sales.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Measuring the change in year-over-year comparable sales allows us to evaluate how our store base and e-commerce operations are performing.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	Various factors affect our comparable sales, including:
1495320_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Timing and success of promotional and advertising efforts.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	In recent years, comparable store sales have declined.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	With that in mind, we are slowing our full-line store opening plan in fiscal 2017 to four new stores from an average of approximately 20 new stores in prior years.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P20_S2	We will continue to evaluate our plans for store openings in future years in light of demand and store performance.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P20_S3	Gross Profit Gross profit is equal to our net revenues less our cost of sales.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P20_S4	Cost of sales includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise, distribution center costs, operations overhead, duty, and all inbound freight costs incurred.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P20_S5	The components of our reported cost of sales may not be comparable to those of other retail and wholesale companies.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Gross profit can be impacted by changes in volume; fluctuations in sales price; operational efficiencies, such as leveraging of fixed costs; promotional activities, such as free shipping; commodity prices, such as cotton prices; and labor costs.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	A expenses include selling; advertising, marketing, and product development; and administrative.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	Selling expenses include Direct business expenses such as store expenses, employee compensation, and store occupancy and supply costs, as well as Indirect business expenses consisting primarily of employee compensation and other expenses associated with sales to Indirect retailers.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P21_S3	Advertising, marketing, and product development expenses include employee compensation, media costs, creative production expenses, marketing agency fees, new product design costs, public relations expenses, and market research expenses.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P21_S4	A portion of our advertising expenses may be reimbursed by Indirect retailers, and such amount is classified as other income.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P21_S5	Administrative expenses include employee compensation for corporate functions, corporate headquarters occupancy costs, consulting and software expenses, and charitable donations.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P21_S6	Other Income We support many of our Indirect retailers marketing efforts by distributing certain catalogs and promotional mailers to current and prospective customers.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P21_S7	Our Indirect retailers reimburse us for a portion of the cost to produce these materials.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P21_S8	Reimbursement received is recorded as other income.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P21_S9	The related cost to design, produce, and distribute the catalogs and mailers is recorded as SG A expense.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P21_S10	Other income also includes proceeds from the sales of tickets to our annual outlet sale.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Operating Income Operating income is equal to gross profit less SG A expenses plus other income.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	Operating income excludes interest income, interest expense, and income taxes.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations is equal to operating income less net interest expense and income taxes.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P22_S3	Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is equal to the loss from the results of operations related to the direct Japan business, which was exited in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, adjusted for the associated tax benefit.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P22_S4	Net Income Net income is equal to the sum of income from continuing operations and loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes.

1495320_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	The following tables present net revenues by operating segment, both in dollars and as a percentage of our net revenues, and full-line and factory outlet store data for the last three fiscal years:
1495320_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	(2) Financial data recasts Japan results of operations as discontinued operations for all years presented.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	Japan was formerly included in the Direct segment results.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P25_S3	(3) Includes full-line and factory outlet stores.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P25_S4	(4) Comparable sales (including e-commerce) are calculated based upon our stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months and net revenues from our e-commerce operations.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P25_S5	Increase or decrease is reported as a percentage of the comparable sales for the same period in the prior fiscal year.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P25_S6	Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Average net revenues per gross square foot are calculated by dividing total net revenues for our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the period by total gross square footage for those stores.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Net Revenues For fiscal 2016 , net revenues decreased $6.4 million , or 1.3% , to $502.6 million , from $509.0 millio n for fiscal 2015 .
1495320_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	For fiscal 2016 , net revenues increased $15.7 million , or 4.7% , to $351.3 million , from $335.6 million for fiscal 2015 .
1495320_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	This change resulted from a $51.3 million contribution of revenue from our non-comparable stores, which included 26 additional stores in the current year, partially offset by a comparable sales (including e-commerce) decrease of $33.7 million , or 10.6% and a gift card breakage revenue decrease of $1.1 million .
1495320_16_ITEM7_P27_S3	Fiscal 2015 was the first year gift card breakage revenue was recognized; refer to Note 2, herein, for additional information.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P27_S4	The decrease in comparable sales (including e-commerce) includes a 13.2% decrease in e-commerce sales and an 8.6% decrease in comparable store sales, primarily as a result of reduced traffic.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P27_S5	There was also a decrease in sales at our annual outlet sale compared to the prior fiscal year.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P27_S6	We believe the year-over-year traffic declines in e-commerce and stores are due, at least in part, to our intentional reduction of promotional activity.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	The aggregate number of full-line and factory outlet stores grew from 125 at the end of fiscal 2015 , to 150 at the end of fiscal 2016 , which includes the closure of one full-line store in fiscal 2016 .
1495320_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	For fiscal 2016 , net revenues decreased $22.1 million , or 12.7% , to $151.3 million , from $173.4 million for fiscal 2015 , primarily due to lower orders from specialty retail accounts, as well as a reduction in the number of specialty retailers.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Gross Profit For fiscal 2016 , gross profit increased $12.2 million , or 4.5% , to $281.2 million , from $269.0 million for fiscal 2015 .
1495320_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	As a percentage of net revenues, gross profit increased to 55.9% for fiscal 2016 , from 52.9% for fiscal 2015 .
1495320_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	The year-over-year increase in the gross margin rate was primarily related to sourcing efficiencies (lower product costs combined with Fall 2014 cost reductions at the Company s domestic manufacturing facility as well as leverage of overhead costs resulting from an increase in units manufactured), increased sales penetration of higher-margin MFO products, reduced promotional activity and lower levels of liquidation sales.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P29_S3	Gross profit during fiscal 2016 was impacted by restructuring charges of $3.4 million related to the closure of our manufacturing facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, as discussed in more detail in Note 15 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P29_S4	For fiscal 2016 , SG A expenses increased $28.1 million , or 13.5% , to $236.8 millio n, from $208.7 million for fiscal 2015 .
1495320_16_ITEM7_P29_S5	As a percentage of net revenues, SG A expenses were 47.1% and 41.0% for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 , respectively.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P29_S6	The increase in SG A expenses for fiscal 2016 included $1.3 million in employee severance expense and $1.2 million in expense related to a retail store early termination agreement that did not occur in the comparable prior year period.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P29_S7	The remaining increase was primarily due to investments in new stores, $6.0 million in incremental marketing and advertising, $2.7 million in additional incentive compensation, as well as $2.3 million in incremental store impairment charges.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P29_S8	SG A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to the aforementioned items, as well as fixed expenses being spread over lower revenues and deleveraging of store operating expenses as a result of lower comparable store sales.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P29_S9	Other Income For fiscal 2016 , other income decreased $1.3 million , or 36.6% , to $2.4 million , from $3.7 million for fiscal 2015 , primarily due to a decrease in reimbursement of co-op mailer expense from Indirect retailers.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P29_S10	Operating Income For fiscal 2016 , operating income decreased $17.4 million , or 27.1% , to $46.7 million , from $64.1 million for fiscal 2015 .
1495320_16_ITEM7_P29_S11	As a percentage of net revenues, operating income was 9.3% and 12.6% for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 , respectively.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P29_S12	Operating income for fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by the $5.9 million in restructuring and other charges described above under Gross Profit and Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P29_S13	The remaining decrease in operating income was due to an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses and a decrease in other income, partially offset by an increase in gross profit, as described above.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P29_S14	The following table provides additional information about our operating income (in thousands).
1495320_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	For fiscal 2016 , the change in operating income was essentially flat.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	As a percentage of Direct segment net revenues, operating income in the Direct segment was 21.1% and 22.1% for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	Operating income for fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by the $3.5 million , or 1.0% as a percentage of Direct segment net revenues, in restructuring and other charges related to the closure of our manufacturing facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and a retail store early termination agreement.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P30_S3	For fiscal 2016 , operating income decreased $5.8 million , or 8.8% .

1495320_16_ITEM7_P30_S5	The increase in operating income as a percentage of Indirect segment net revenues was primarily due to an increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, as described above.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P30_S6	This increase was partially offset by $1.1 million , or 0.8% as a percentage of Indirect segment net revenues, in restructuring charges related to the closure of our manufacturing facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	For fiscal 2016 , unallocated expenses increased $11.6 million , or 15.2% .
1495320_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	The increase in unallocated expenses included $1.3 million in employee severance expense.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	The remaining increase was primarily due to incremental marketing and advertising investments, an increase in incentive compensation due to Company performance, as well as an increase in depreciation expense primarily as a result of the campus consolidation.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P31_S3	For fiscal 2016 , net interest expense decreased $0.1 million , or 35.4% , to $0.3 million , from $0.4 million in fiscal 2015 .

1495320_16_ITEM7_P31_S5	The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to one-time decreases to tax expense in fiscal 2015 that did not occur in fiscal 2016, as well as increases in permanent tax exclusions in fiscal 2016 including an increase in income tax reserves for uncertain federal and state tax positions related to research and development tax credits from prior years.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P31_S6	Income from Continuing Operations For fiscal 2016 , income from continuing operations decreased $13.2 million , or 32.5% , to $27.6 million from $40.8 million in fiscal 2015 .

1495320_16_ITEM7_P31_S8	Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes For fiscal 2015, loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes was $2.4 million reflecting the exit of the direct Japan business in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P31_S9	Net Income For fiscal 2016 , net income decreased $10.8 million , or 28.3% , to $27.6 million from $38.4 million in fiscal 2015 .

1495320_16_ITEM7_P32_S3	Our comparable store sales decreased 16.1%.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Comparable sales (including e-commerce) and comparable store sales were negatively impacted by year-over-year declines in store traffic.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	The aggregate number of full-line and factory outlet stores grew from 99 at the end of fiscal 2014, to 125 at the end of fiscal 2015, which includes the closure of one full-line store in fiscal 2015.

1495320_16_ITEM7_P33_S5	The year-over-year decline in gross margin rate was primarily related to increased year-over-year promotional activity.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG A) For fiscal 2015, SG A expenses increased $7.5 million, or 3.7%, to $208.7 million, from $201.2 million for fiscal 2014.

1495320_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	We also have access to additional liquidity, if needed, through borrowings under our $125.0 million second amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Historically, our primary cash needs have been for merchandise inventories; payroll; store rent; capital expenditures associated with operational equipment, buildings, information technology, and opening new stores; and debt repayments.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	The most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, merchandise inventories, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current liabilities.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	We believe that cash flows from operating activities and the availability of borrowings under our second amended and restated credit agreement will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, share repurchases, and debt payments for the foreseeable future.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	Cash Flow Analysis A summary of operating, investing, and financing activities is shown in the following table (in thousands):
1495320_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation, the effect of changes in assets and liabilities, and tenant-improvement allowances received from landlords under our store leases.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities was $43.3 million during fiscal 2016 , as compared to $103.8 million during fiscal 2015 .
1495320_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in net income of $10.9 million and changes in assets and liabilities which provided an $8.8 million use of cash as compared to a $45.3 million source of cash in the prior year, primarily as a result of inventories, accounts payable and income taxes.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P40_S3	Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $103.8 million during fiscal 2015, as compared to $87.9 million during fiscal 2014.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P40_S4	The increase was primarily due to a reduction in inventory of $44.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in net income and accounts payable of $20.4 million and $10.0 million, respectively.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for growth related to new store openings, buildings, operational equipment, and information technology investments.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	Net cash used in investing activities was $26.3 million in fiscal 2016 , compared to $37.1 million in fiscal 2015 .
1495320_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	The $10.8 million decrease in capital expenditures was driven primarily by the campus consolidation which was substantially completed in fiscal 2015.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P41_S3	Net cash used in investing activities was $37.1 million in fiscal 2015, compared to $22.9 million in fiscal 2014.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P41_S4	The $14.2 million increase in capital expenditures was driven primarily by the campus consolidation and the cost associated with the opening of four additional stores during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P41_S5	Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately $20.0 million .
1495320_16_ITEM7_P41_S6	Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $31.5 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $13.6 million in fiscal 2015 .
1495320_16_ITEM7_P41_S7	The $17.9 million increase in financing activities was primarily due to the completion of purchases of shares of the Company's common stock made under the 2014 Share Repurchase Program, as well as purchases under the 2015 Share Repurchase Program.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P41_S8	Net cash used in financing activities was $13.6 million in fiscal 2015 which was primarily related to purchases of shares of the Company's common stock made under the 2014 Share Repurchase Program.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P41_S9	This compares to net cash used in financing activities of $15.3 million in fiscal 2014, primarily resulting from $15.0 million net payments under our amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Credit Agreement provides for certain credit facilities to VBD in an aggregate principal amount not to initially exceed $125.0 million, the proceeds of which will be used for general corporate purposes of VBD and its subsidiaries, including but not limited to Vera Bradley International, LLC and Vera Bradley Sales, LLC (collectively, the Named Subsidiaries ).
1495320_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	Amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at VBD's option, at a per annum rate equal to either (A) the Alternate Base Rate ( ABR ) plus the Applicable Margin, where the ABR is the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and (iii) Adjusted LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1%, and the Applicable Margin is a percentage ranging from 0.00% to 0.70% depending upon the Company's leverage ratio or (B) Adjusted LIBOR plus the Applicable Margin, where Adjusted LIBOR means LIBOR, as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities, and Applicable Margin is a percentage ranging from 1.00% to 1.70% depending upon the Company's leverage ratio.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	Any loans made, or letters of credit issued, pursuant to the Credit Agreement mature on July 15, 2020.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	As of January 30, 2016 , the Company had borrowing availability of $125.0 million under the agreement.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	VBD's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and the Named Subsidiaries.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P43_S3	The obligations of VBD under the Credit Agreement are secured by first priority security interests in all of the respective assets of VBD, the Company, and the Named Subsidiaries and a pledge of the equity interests of VBD and the Named Subsidiaries.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	The Credit Agreement contains various restrictive covenants, including restrictions on the Company's ability to dispose of assets, make acquisitions or investments, incur debt or liens, make distributions to stockholders or repurchase outstanding stock, enter into related party transactions and make capital expenditures, other than upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	The Company is also required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum ratio of EBITDAR to the sum of interest expense plus rentals (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and a limit on capital expenditures.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	Upon an event of default, which includes certain customary events such as, among other things, a failure to make required payments when due, a failure to comply with covenants, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, a material adverse change (as defined in the Credit Agreement), defaults under other material indebtedness, and a change in control, the lenders may accelerate amounts outstanding, terminate the agreement and foreclose on all collateral.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P44_S3	The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of January 30, 2016 .
1495320_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	We enter into long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily non-cancellable operating leases.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	As of January 30, 2016 , our contractual cash obligations over the next several periods are as follows:
1495320_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	(1) Our store leases generally range from five to ten years with varying renewal options.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	Our future operating lease obligations would change if we were to extend these leases, or if we were to enter into new operating leases.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	(2) Purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	(3) Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our uncertain tax positions at January 30, 2016 , we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	Therefore, $3.1 million of uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosures relating to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	We evaluate our accounting policies, estimates, and judgments on an on-going basis.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	We evaluate the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and believe that the following policies and estimates involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position, and are therefore discussed as critical.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	The following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent results of operations.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	Our historical results for the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, however, have not been materially impacted by such variances.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	More information on all of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from the sale of our products is recognized upon customer receipt of the product when collection of the associated receivables is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and ownership and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, which, for e-commerce and most Indirect sales, reflects an estimate of shipments that customers have not yet received.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	The adjustment of these shipments is based on actual delivery dates to the customer.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P53_S2	Significant changes in shipping terms or delivery times could materially impact our revenues in a given period.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	We reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	In the Direct business returns are refunded by issuing the same payment tender of the original purchase and in the Indirect business the customer is issued a credit to its account to apply to outstanding invoices.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	Merchandise exchanges of the same product at the same price are not considered merchandise returns.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	Product returns are often resalable through our annual outlet sale or other channels.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P55_S2	Additionally, we reserve for other potential product credits and for customer shipments not yet received.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P55_S3	The balance of the reserve for returns, customer shipments not yet received, and general credits was $3.3 million and $3.7 million as of January 30, 2016 , and January 31, 2015 , respectively.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	We sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers and do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	Gift cards that we issue are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed, at which point revenue is recognized.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	In addition, we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	We determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P58_S2	Market is determined based on net realizable value, which includes costs to dispose.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P58_S3	Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excess quantities, and other factors, including the popularity of a pattern or product, in evaluating net realizable value.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	We record valuation adjustments to our inventories, which are reflected in cost of sales, if the cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	This adjustment calculation requires us to make assumptions and estimates, which are based on factors such as merchandise seasonality, historical trends, and estimated sales and inventory levels, including sell-through of remaining units.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	In addition, as part of inventory adjustments, we provide for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from our physical inventory counts.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P59_S3	We perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrinkage provision accordingly.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P59_S4	The balance of inventory adjustments was $5.5 million and $9.7 million for these matters as of the fiscal years ended January 30, 2016 , and January 31, 2015 , respectively.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P59_S5	These adjustments related primarily to raw materials of retired patterns and styles and merchandise from the baby gift category, which was discontinued by the Company, and technology accessories.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P59_S6	Fiscal 2015 included a raw materials reserve related to the closure of our domestic manufacturing facility.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P59_S7	We have the ability to move retired finished goods through a number of channels, including the annual outlet sale, our website and factory outlet stores, and through third-party liquidators as needed.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is based on our pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P60_S2	We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained; (2) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	Taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	We believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P61_S2	Taxing authorities, however, may take a contrary position.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P61_S3	Our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if, upon final resolution with taxing authorities, we prevail in positions for which we have established reserves, or are required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	Valuation of Long-lived Assets Property, plant, and equipment assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	In evaluating an asset for recoverability, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset at the store level, the lowest identifiable level of cash flow, if applicable.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset is less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, usually determined by an estimated discounted cash flow analysis of the asset.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	Factors used in the valuation of long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, our plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results, and projected future cash flows.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	With respect to our stores, we analyze store economics, location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies in our selection process.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	Impairment charges are classified in SG A expenses and were $2.8 million and $0.4 million for the periods ended January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , respectively.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	The discounted cash flow models used to estimate the applicable fair values involve numerous estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	Changes to these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the fair value estimates.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	The estimates and assumptions critical to the overall fair value estimates include: (1) estimated future cash flow generated at the store level; and (2) discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair values.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P67_S3	These and other estimates and assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and our expectations and may change in the future based on period-specific facts and circumstances.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P67_S4	If economic conditions were to deteriorate, future impairment charges may be required.
1495320_16_ITEM7_P67_S5	Transactions with Related Parties See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, of this report for information regarding transactions with related parties.
1495320_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our second amended and restated credit agreement, which bear interest at variable rates.
1495320_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The second amended and restated credit agreement allows for a revolving credit commitment of $125.0 million, bearing interest at a variable rate, based on (A) the ABR plus the Applicable Margin, where the ABR is the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and (iii) Adjusted LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1%, and the Applicable Margin is a percentage ranging from 0.00% to 0.70% depending upon the Company's leverage ratio or (B) Adjusted LIBOR plus the Applicable Margin, where Adjusted LIBOR means LIBOR, as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities, and Applicable Margin is a percentage ranging from 1.00% to 1.70% depending upon the Company's leverage ratio.
1495320_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Assuming borrowings available under the second amended and restated credit agreement are fully extended, each quarter point increase or decrease in the interest rate would change our annual interest expense by approximately $0.3 million.
1495320_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Impact of Inflation Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost.
1495320_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Although it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial.
1495320_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We source a majority of our materials from various suppliers in China and South Korea.
1495320_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Substantially all purchases and sales involving foreign persons are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore we do not hedge using any derivative instruments.
1495320_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Historically, we have not been impacted materially by changes in exchange rates.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vera Bradley, Inc.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vera Bradley, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 30, 2016.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P1_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1495320_16_ITEM8_P1_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P2_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Vera Bradley, Inc. and subsidiaries at January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 30, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P2_S4	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Vera Bradley, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 29, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vera Bradley, Inc.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have audited Vera Bradley, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
1495320_16_ITEM8_P4_S1	Vera Bradley, Inc. and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P4_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1495320_16_ITEM8_P4_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P4_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P4_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P5_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P5_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P5_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P5_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P5_S4	In our opinion, Vera Bradley, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2016, based on the COSO criteria.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P5_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Vera Bradley, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 30, 2016 of Vera Bradley, Inc. and subsidiaries and our report dated March 29, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1495320_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	Description of the Company Vera Bradley is a leading designer of women s handbags and accessories, luggage and travel items, eyewear, and stationery and gifts.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P11_S1	Founded in 1982 by friends Barbara Bradley Baekgaard and Patricia R. Miller, the brand s innovative designs, iconic patterns, and versatile styles offer women of all ages a colorful way to accessorize every look.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P11_S2	Vera Bradley offers a unique, multi-channel sales model, as well as a focus on service and a high level of customer engagement.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P11_S3	The Company sells its products through two reportable segments: Direct and Indirect.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P11_S4	The Direct business consists of sales of Vera Bradley products through the Company s full-line and factory outlet stores in the United States, verabradley.com, direct-to-consumer eBay sales, and the Company's annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P11_S5	As of January 30, 2016 , the Company operated 110 full-line stores and 40 factory outlet stores.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Indirect business consists of sales of Vera Bradley products to approximately 2,600 specialty retail locations, substantially all of which are located in the United States, as well as department stores, national accounts, third party e-commerce sites, the Company's wholesale business in Japan, and third party inventory liquidators.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P13_S1	The Company has eliminated intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P13_S2	The Company utilizes a 52 - 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P13_S3	As such, fiscal year 2016 , 2015 and 2014 ending on January 30, 2016 , January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014 , respectively, each reflected a 52 -week period.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the Company s assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosures relating to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P14_S1	Significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include the valuation of inventories, accounts receivable valuation allowances, sales return allowances, and the useful lives of assets for depreciation or amortization.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P14_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P14_S3	The Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P14_S4	Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents represent cash on hand, deposits with financial institutions, and investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P15_S1	Concentration of Credit Risk The Company maintains nearly all of its cash and cash equivalents with one financial institution.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P15_S2	The Company monitors the credit standing of this financial institution on a regular basis.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P16_S1	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P16_S2	Market is determined based on net realizable value, which includes costs to dispose.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P16_S3	Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excess quantities, and other factors, including the popularity of a pattern or product, in evaluating net realizable value.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are carried at cost and depreciated or amortized over the following estimated useful lives using the straight-line method:
1495320_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the asset or the lease term.
1495320_16_ITEM8_P18_S1	Lease terms typically range from five to ten years.

1495320_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	Ms. Miller retired in October 2012 as our National Spokesperson, but continues to serve on the Board of Directors along with Ms. Baekgaard.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P19_S3	Our long-term vision is to build on the Company's rich heritage and establish Vera Bradley as a premium global lifestyle brand, expand our customer reach and grow our customer connections.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P19_S4	Our long-term strategic plan is centered upon the three planks of product, distribution, and marketing.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P19_S5	We call our target aspirational customer the Day Maker.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P19_S6	She is organized, thoughtful and, most of all, appreciates femininity and beauty - in color, print and thoughtful details.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P19_S7	We are focused on creating beautiful solutions for the Day Maker and believe we have a great opportunity to attract more Day Makers to our brand through our product offerings, our distribution channels, and our marketing efforts.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P19_S8	We have identified five key businesses where we can offer the Day Maker beautiful solutions that we believe will propel our future growth.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P19_S9	We are optimizing our existing core product portfolio and expanding into relevant new categories.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P19_S10	We will continue to use licenses and strategic partnerships as appropriate to expand our product categories.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our Fashion Bag and Accessories business continues to be our largest opportunity and allows us to showcase our innovation, function, and fashion.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Travel remains a core differentiator for Vera Bradley and allows us to both embrace our heritage and to showcase newness and functionality with products like Lighten Up and our unique collapsible luggage.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our Campus business has been successful, and we believe further expansion of our Collegiate Collection will help continue to propel our Campus authority forward.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	Wellness and Beauty is a growing category as our Day Maker is looking for experiential events and wants to find wellness and beauty products that enhance her holistically.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our home and body fragrance collection and our current line of multi-purpose sport bags play into this theme.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	We believe Home can continue to be a significant growth opportunity for Vera Bradley, with market attractiveness and a great brand fit.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	The Day Maker s fashion statement is often her home.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	Licensing will play a key role in the home area.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	In each of these areas, fabric, pattern innovation, and newness remain critical in order to stay relevant.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	Vera Bradley products are available wherever our consumer chooses to shop including full-line and factory outlet stores, online, and department and specialty retail stores.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	We continue to focus on tightly integrating our multi-channel business by strengthening our Direct distribution channel (including full-line stores, factory outlet stores, and e-commerce), further developing our department store and other Indirect channel relationships and right-sizing and working to strengthen the performance in our specialty retail channel.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P27_S2	In 2007 and 2009, we opened our first full-line and factory outlet stores, respectively.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P27_S3	We believe there continue to be long-term opportunities for new stores throughout the United States.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P27_S4	We opened four new full-line and six new factory outlet stores in fiscal 2017; however, we are continuing to slow our short-term plans for new store openings until we begin to produce comparable store sales growth.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P27_S5	We do not currently plan to open any new full-line stores in fiscal 2018.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P27_S6	In fact, we expect to relocate or close up to 15 underperforming full-line stores over the next two years.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P27_S7	In our full-line stores, we are continuing to work to drive traffic and sales through building a service and selling culture, nurturing more community outreach, and building more localized assortments.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P27_S8	During fiscal 2017, we refreshed 14 full-line stores to reflect our new branding including updates to the storefront facade, logo, and interior.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P27_S9	We also completed facade updates at 15 of our newest full-line stores to reflect our new logo.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P27_S10	We are continuing our refresh program and expect that about half of our full-line stores will be updated by the end of fiscal 2018.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P27_S11	We plan to add six new factory outlet stores in fiscal 2018.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P27_S12	At January 28, 2017, approximately 70% of the product in the outlet channel was made specifically for our factory outlet stores.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	In 2006, we began selling directly to consumers through verabradley.com.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	In fiscal 2017, we had approximately 53 million visits to our website.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P28_S2	Building our digital flagship remains a key part of our distribution strategy.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P28_S3	The redesign and conversion of our website to a new platform was completed in February 2017.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P28_S4	This new platform offers enhanced ease of shopping and incremental functionality including an upgraded mobile experience; additional navigation and search enhancements; improved product pages with enhanced imagery, product videos, and user-generated content; and new capabilities like eGift cards and order on line, pick up in store.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P28_S5	The new platform also gives us capabilities to create deeper customer relationships and create value through more personalization and strategic customization.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P28_S6	Our department store relationships allow us to expose our brand to new customers and showcase our new product assortments.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P28_S7	We are currently in over 730 department store locations, including Macy's, Dillard's, Belk, Bon-Ton, and Von Maur.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P28_S8	In the department stores, we are continuing to work on enhancing our brand presentation and to expand our lifestyle brand offerings.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P28_S9	The specialty retail channel is the heritage of our business and remains very important to us.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P28_S10	We continue to add select accounts while discontinuing unproductive accounts.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P28_S11	While the specialty retail business is becoming a smaller percentage of our total revenue base, it is still an important piece of our business, and we are working to stabilize it by segmenting specific products to this channel and assisting retailers with assortment planning.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P28_S12	We have a small wholesale presence in Japan.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P28_S13	We are exploring the possibility of expanding into other countries in the long-term but do not foresee any additional international country expansion in fiscal 2018.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	Marketing and brand positioning are both critical elements as we continue to engage new consumers and strengthen our bond with our existing customers.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	During fiscal 2017, our focus was to increase brand relevancy, desire for the brand, and purchase intent.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P29_S2	We activated our new branding and brand positioning in fiscal 2017, which included updating elements of our visual identity such as our logo and further evolving our marketing to speak more directly to the Day Maker.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P29_S3	We believe that highlighting our new product and enhancing our brand creative to assure our customer that we understand her will give the Day Maker a new reason to look at Vera Bradley.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P29_S4	Well-timed and well-executed brand activation is critical to increasing our brand relevancy and increasing purchase intent.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P29_S5	Through comprehensive consumer research, we have designed a media plan that we believe effectively targets our Day Maker customers and attracts both lapsed and new Day Maker consumers to our brand, reaching them where they already are looking and giving them content that showcases our beautiful solutions.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P29_S6	Our media efforts include a fully-integrated mix of digital, social, experiential, and print, with our goal being to surround the Day Maker with our brand.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P29_S7	We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us within the marketplace:

1495320_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	Vera Bradley is positioned in the market as a lifestyle brand that inspires consumers to express their femininity, individuality, and sense of style.

1495320_17_ITEM1_P40_S4	We typically begin the development stage of our products in the Vera Bradley portfolio twelve to eighteen months in advance of their release.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P40_S5	The development of each new pattern includes the design of a primary, secondary, and sometimes a tertiary print.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P40_S6	To seek fresh perspectives, we often collaborate with independent designers to create unique patterns for each season and also maintain an internal print design team.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P40_S7	We oversee the development and exercise the final approval of all patterns and designs.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P40_S8	Once developed, we generally copyright our patterns as appropriate.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P40_S9	We believe that great design is not only central to our product development efforts, but also is a fundamental part of our brand development and growth strategies.

1495320_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	We use online marketing and social networking sites as tools to increase brand awareness and drive traffic to verabradley.com and to our stores.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	We have captured approximately 4.5 million customer e-mail addresses in our online customer file, with many of these customers providing age, occupation, and location data.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P47_S2	This captured information provides us with deeper insight into the products and categories that are in the highest interest of our customers, and allows us to better target our customers with appropriate messages.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P47_S3	As of January 28, 2017 , we had approximately 1.7 million Facebook fans and approximately 83,000 Twitter followers.

1495320_17_ITEM1_P47_S6	Seasonal Vera Bradley catalogs are a vehicle for promoting our brand and product portfolio.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P47_S7	Each catalog is sent to a targeted customer mailing list.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P47_S8	In addition to distributing the catalog, we produce and distribute a number of other marketing pieces, including postcards and mini-mailers.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P47_S9	We believe our direct mail medium generates excitement and awareness about the brand and seasonal introductions and allows us to reach both new and loyal customers in their homes.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	Seasonality Because Vera Bradley products are frequently given as gifts, we have historically realized, and expect to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of November and December.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	Channels of Distribution We distribute our products through our Direct and Indirect segments.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	This multi-channel distribution model is designed to enable operational flexibility and maximizes the methods by which we can access potential customers.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	We have developed a retail presence through our full-line stores, all located in the United States, which provides us with a format to showcase our brand and the full array of Vera Bradley products.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P49_S3	As of January 28, 2017 , we operated 113 full-line stores averaging approximately 1,900 square feet per store.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P49_S4	In fiscal 2017, we opened our first flagship store in the SoHo neighborhood of New York which offers customers a unique store experience, as well as exclusive product.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P49_S5	Our sales associates are passionate about our products and customer service, which, we believe, translates into a superior shopping experience.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P49_S6	Our factory outlet stores are a vehicle for selling factory exclusive styles, as well as retired merchandise at discounted prices, while maintaining brand integrity.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P49_S7	At the end of fiscal 2017 , approximately 70% of the merchandise found in our factory outlet stores was factory exclusive styles.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	We believe our factory outlet stores are an integral part of our distribution strategy, as this format provides an additional channel of distribution for our products and enables us to better target value-oriented customers.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our factory outlet stores average approximately 3,200 square feet per store.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	As of January 28, 2017 , we operated 46 factory outlet stores all located in the United States.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P50_S3	Our store location decisions for both full-line and factory outlet stores are made based upon our comprehensive retail strategy that includes actual and planned penetration in both Indirect and Direct segments, as well as existing e-commerce demand.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P50_S4	At this time, we do not believe all geographical markets have been fully penetrated by our distribution channels.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P50_S5	We believe that long-term expansion of our store base will increase brand awareness and reinforce our brand image.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	In addition to analyzing store economics, we pay particular attention to the location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	Along with seeking co-tenants that we believe share our target customer, we seek a balanced mix of moderate and high-end retailers to encourage high levels of traffic.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P51_S2	Our target full-line store size is approximately 1,800 square feet, but we are able to work with spaces as small as 1,000 square feet or, depending on our market strategy and relevant economic factors, spaces as large as 2,800 square feet.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P51_S3	Our target factory outlet store size is approximately 3,000 square feet.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P51_S4	The focus of our store operations is providing consumers with a comfortable and memorable shopping experience.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P51_S5	We strive to make the experience interactive through special store events, such as showcasing newly launched products or celebrating our namesake s birthday.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P51_S6	Our customer service philosophy emphasizes friendly service, merchandise knowledge, and passion for the brand.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P51_S7	Consequently, an essential requirement for the success of our stores is our ability to attract, train, and retain talented, highly motivated district managers, store managers, and sales associates.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P51_S8	We expect our full-line stores to average approximately 1,800 square feet per store, and we expect to invest approximately $0.4 million per new store, consisting of inventory costs, pre-opening costs, and build-out costs, less tenant-improvement allowances.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P51_S9	We expect our factory outlet stores to average approximately 3,000 square feet per store, and we expect to invest approximately $0.4 million per new store, consisting of inventory costs, pre-opening costs, and build-out costs, less tenant-improvement allowances.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P51_S10	In 2006, we began selling our products through the verabradley.com website.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P51_S11	The objective of verabradley.com is to provide both a mechanism for marketing directly to consumers and a storefront where consumers can find the entire full-line Vera Bradley collection.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P51_S12	Since fiscal 2013, we have continually invested in upgrades to our website allowing for a more user friendly homepage, enabling us to ship internationally, enhancing the checkout experience, adding product recommendations, enhancing product descriptions, adding silhouettes for product scale, generating cart and site abandonment emails, gathering and analyzing customer feedback, and enhancing our search capabilities.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P51_S13	To continue to enhance our website engagement, we completed a redesign and conversion of our website to a new platform in February 2017.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	enhancements; improved product pages with enhanced imagery, product videos, and user-generated content; and new capabilities like eGift cards and order on line, pick up in store.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P52_S1	We had approximately 53 million visits to verabradley.com during fiscal 2017 .
1495320_17_ITEM1_P52_S2	Our annual outlet sale is held in the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum Exposition Center in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P52_S3	The annual outlet sale is an important tradition for Vera Bradley, has many loyal followers, and is an opportunity for us to sell our retired merchandise at discounted prices in a brand-right fashion.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P52_S4	We attracted approximately 50,000 attendees to our 2016 annual outlet sale.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P52_S5	As of January 28, 2017 , we sold our products in approximately 2,600 specialty retail locations, the majority of which we have had long-standing relationships, as well as department stores, national accounts, third party e-commerce sites, our wholesale customer in Japan and third-party inventory liquidators.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	In fiscal 2012, we launched our products in the department store channel.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	We are currently in over 730 department store locations, including approximately 350 Macy's locations, approximately 270 Dillard's, over 40 Belk, over 40 Bon-Ton, and approximately 30 Von Maur locations.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P53_S2	The top 30% of our specialty retailers account for approximately 70% of total specialty retailer revenue.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P53_S3	No single Indirect retailer represented more than 10% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2017 , with the top ten Indirect retailers representing in the aggregate approximately 40% of total Indirect net revenues.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P53_S4	The majority of our Indirect retailers have been customers for over five years.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P53_S5	We believe that having an in-house field sales force results in more consistent brand presentation and messaging, enhanced support for our Indirect customers, and a more predictable, scalable, and cost-efficient business model.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P53_S6	As of January 28, 2017 , our sales team consisted of approximately 40 in-house, full-time sales consultants.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P53_S7	The compensation structure for our sales consultants consists of a combination of fixed pay and sales-based incentives.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P53_S8	In addition to acquiring new and growing existing accounts, our sales consultants serve as a support center for our Indirect customers by assisting and educating them in areas such as merchandising and visual presentation, marketing the brand, product selection, and inventory management.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P53_S9	Our visual merchandising program provides our sales consultants with a framework to guide our Indirect customers regarding optimal product placement and display that is intended to reinforce the message that our brand is distinct from those of our competitors.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	Manufacturing and Supply Chain Model Our multi-country manufacturing and supply chain model is designed to achieve efficient, timely, and accurate order fulfillment while maintaining appropriate levels of inventory.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	Our manufacturing and sourcing strategy is part of the larger cross-functional product development process.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P54_S2	The overall objective for our sourcing team is to build and sustain collaborative partnerships throughout our supply chain, with a focus on identifying appropriate countries and partners to manufacture our products.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P54_S3	The sourcing team leverages its expertise in negotiation, relationship management, and change management to maintain a strong global supply chain.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P54_S4	We strive to maintain the appropriate balance of inventory to enable us to provide a high level of service to our customers, including prompt and accurate delivery of our products.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P54_S5	We have an active and nimble sales and operations planning process that helps us balance the supply and demand issues that we encounter in our business, optimize our inventory levels, and anticipate inventory needs.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P54_S6	We have also integrated our planning, forecasting, and segmentation processes under one function called Merchandise Planning and Allocation.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	Approximately half of our products are cotton-based.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	Our other fabrics include nylon, polyester, microfiber, leather, and faux leather.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P55_S2	We source our materials from various suppliers in Asia, with the majority coming from China and South Korea.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P55_S3	Our global sourcing team works with select suppliers enabling us to optimize the mix of cost, lead time, quality, and reliability within our global supply network.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P55_S4	All of our suppliers must comply with our quality standards, and we use only a limited number of pre-approved suppliers who have demonstrated a commitment to delivering the highest quality products.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P55_S5	In April 2016, we opened an office in Hong Kong to lead the global supply chain in Asia, including the oversight of sourcing and procurement.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	The majority of our finished goods, not sourced through licenses or strategic partners, are manufactured by a variety of global manufacturers located primarily in China, Vietnam and Cambodia.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	We are not dependent upon any single manufacturer for our products.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P56_S2	When determining the size of orders placed with our manufacturers, we take into account forward-looking demand, lead times for specific products, current inventory levels, and minimum order quantity requirements.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	Overseas production has resulted in substantial cost savings and a reduction of capital investment.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	With the oversight of our office in Hong Kong and our independent contractors, we believe these financial benefits have been realized without sacrificing the level of quality inherent in our products or service to our customers.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	In 2007, we consolidated our warehousing and shipping functions into one distribution center, located in Roanoke, Indiana.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P58_S1	In fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2015, we expanded the facility by 200,000 and 10,000 square-feet, respectively, which resulted in a total distribution center space of 428,500 square-feet.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P58_S2	This automated, computerized facility allows Vera Bradley employees to receive information directly from the order-collection center and quickly identify the products and quantities necessary for a particular order.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P58_S3	The expansion resulted in capacity gains in the areas of inbound receiving, inventory storage, order fulfillment, value-add processing, and shipping.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P58_S4	The facility s technology enables us to more accurately process and pack orders, as well as track shipments and inventory.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P58_S5	We believe that our systems for the processing and shipment of orders from our distribution center have enabled us to improve our overall customer service through enhanced order accuracy and reduced turnaround time.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P58_S6	Our products are shipped primarily via third-party common carriers to our stores, our Indirect retailers, and department stores, and directly to our customers who purchase through our website.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P58_S7	We believe we are positioned well to support the order fulfillment requirements of our business, including business generated through our website.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P58_S8	We believe that high levels of automation and technology are essential to maintain our competitive position.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P58_S9	We maintain computer hardware, systems applications, and networks to enhance and accelerate the design process, to support the sale and distribution of our products to our customers, and to improve the integration and efficiency of our operations.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P58_S10	Our management information systems are designed to provide, among other things, comprehensive order processing, production, accounting, and management information for the product development, retail, sales, marketing, distribution, finance, and human resources functions of our business.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P58_S11	We use several systems, including MICROS-Retail, SAP, JDA, and SCALE for our information technology requirements.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	Competition We face strong competition in each of the product lines and markets in which we compete.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P59_S1	We believe that all of our products are in similar competitive positions with respect to the number of competitors they face and the level of competition within each product line.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P59_S2	Due to the number of different products we offer, it is not practicable for us to quantify the number of competitors we face.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P59_S3	Our products compete with other branded products within their product categories and with private label products sold by retailers.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P59_S4	In our Indirect business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers, and distributors of handbags, accessories, and other products for the limited space available for the display of such products to the consumer.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P59_S5	Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	In our Direct business, we compete against other independent retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, gift retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	The market for handbags, in particular, is highly competitive.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P60_S2	Our competitors include not only established companies that are expanding their production and marketing of handbags, but also frequent new entrants to the market.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P60_S3	We directly compete with wholesalers and direct sellers of branded handbags and accessories, such as Coach, Michael Kors, Nine West, Dooney Bourke, Kate Spade, Fossil, Brahmin, and Tory Burch.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P60_S4	In varying degrees, depending on the product category involved, we compete on the basis of design (aesthetic appeal), quality (construction), function, price point, distribution, and brand positioning.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P60_S5	We believe that our primary competitive advantages are consumer recognition of our brand, customer loyalty, product development expertise, and our widespread presence through our multi-channel distribution model.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P60_S6	Some of our competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources than we do.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P60_S7	Further, we may face new competitors and increased competition from existing competitors as we expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	Copyrights and Trademarks The development of new patterns includes the design of primary and secondary prints.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P61_S1	Once developed, we generally copyright our patterns as appropriate.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P61_S2	We currently have approximately 820 copyrights.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P61_S3	We also own all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing, and distribution of all of our products, both in the United States and in the other countries in which our products are principally sold.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P61_S4	We aggressively police our trademarks and copyrights and pursue infringers and counterfeiters both domestically and internationally.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P61_S5	Our trademarks will remain in existence for as long as we continue to use and renew them in advance of their expiration dates.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	Employees As of January 28, 2017 , we had approximately 3,100 employees.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P62_S1	Of the total, approximately 2,450 were engaged in retail selling positions, approximately 315 were engaged in distribution, sourcing and quality functions, approximately 35 were engaged in product design, and approximately 300 were engaged in corporate support and administrative functions.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P62_S2	None of our employees are represented by a union.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P62_S3	We believe that our relations with our employees are good, and we have never encountered a significant work stoppage.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P62_S4	Many of our imported products are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs, or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the United States and other countries or impact the cost of such products.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P62_S5	To date, we have not been restricted by quotas in the operation of our business, and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of a majority of our products.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P62_S6	In addition, we are subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions, including U.S. retaliation against prohibited foreign practices, with respect to our product sourcing and international sales operations.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P62_S7	We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental matters, including the handling, transportation, and disposal of our products and our non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, and groundwater.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P62_S8	Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties, or the imposition of other liabilities.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect upon our earnings or financial position.
1495320_17_ITEM1_P63_S1	If we violate any laws or regulations, however, it could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance.

1495320_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	If we are unable to successfully implement our long-term strategic plan and growth strategies, our future operating results could suffer.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	In fiscal 2015, we began to implement a long-term strategic plan focused on product, distribution, and marketing strategies intended to profitably grow our business.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The success of our long-term strategic plan and these growth strategies, alone or collectively, will depend on various factors, including the appeal of our product designs, retail presentation to consumers, effectiveness of our marketing initiatives, competitive conditions, and economic conditions.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our strategic plan.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If we are unsuccessful in implementing some or all of our strategies or initiatives, our future operating results could be adversely impacted.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Changes in general economic conditions, and their impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Consumer confidence and consumer spending may be influenced by fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, changing fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, levels of unemployment and consumer debt levels, changes in net worth based on market conditions, general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment, and weather and weather-related phenomena.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty, and this could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P2_S3	In the event that the U.S. economy worsens, or if there is a decline in consumer-spending levels or other unfavorable conditions, including inflation, we could experience lower than expected net revenues, which could force us to delay or slow the implementation of our growth strategies and adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our inability to predict and respond in a timely manner to changes in consumer demand could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Our success depends on our ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies consumer demand in a timely manner.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P2_S7	We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop appealing patterns and styles or meet changing consumer demands in the future.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P2_S8	If we misjudge the market for our products, we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P2_S9	In addition, changes to our product assortment and to our available fabrications, as well as the availability and breadth of pattern assortment may not gain consumer acceptance.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Merchandise misjudgments could adversely impact our net revenues and results of operations.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P2_S11	We may continue to experience declines in comparable sales and there can be no guarantee that the strategic initiatives we are implementing to improve our results will be successful.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P2_S12	We may not be able to regain the levels of comparable sales that we have experienced in the past, and comparable sales may also further deteriorate.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P2_S13	If our future comparable sales fail to meet market expectations, then the price of our common stock could decline.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P2_S14	Also, the aggregate results of operations of our stores have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P2_S15	Numerous factors influence comparable sales, including fashion trends, competition, national and regional economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, marketing programs, changes in consumer shopping trends, site selection strategy, and weather conditions.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P2_S16	These factors may cause our comparable sales results to be lower in the future than in recent periods or lower than expectations, either of which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If our multi-channel distribution model is not successful, our business and results of operations may suffer.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	wholesale customer in Japan, and third party inventory liquidators.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	These channels are sometimes in direct competition and sales through these channels may not be incremental to total sales.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We may not be able to successfully open new stores and/or operate new and current stores as planned, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Our long-term future growth will depend on our ability to successfully open and operate new and current stores.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We plan to open approximately six new stores during fiscal 2018, and additional new stores each year thereafter.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Our ability to successfully open and operate stores depends on many factors, including our ability to:
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	successfully integrate new stores into our existing operations and information technology systems.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The success of new store openings may also be affected by our ability to initiate marketing efforts in advance of opening our first store in a particular region.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Additionally, we will incur pre-opening costs and we may encounter initial losses while new stores commence operations, which could strain our resources and adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business depends on a strong brand.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If we are unable to execute our brand strategy, intended to enhance our brand, then revenues and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We believe that the brand image that we have developed has contributed significantly to the success of our business.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We also believe that enhancing the Vera Bradley brand through our new brand strategy is critical to maintaining and expanding our customer base.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Enhancing our brand and implementing our new brand strategy may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as product design, store operations, store design, community relations, and marketing.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P6_S5	If we are unable to successfully execute our brand strategy, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Our results of operations could suffer if we lose key management or design associates or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Our performance depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and product development teams.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P6_S8	These executives and design associates have substantial experience in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P6_S9	Although we have entered into an employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, we may not be able to retain his services or those of other key individuals in the future.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P6_S10	The unexpected loss of services of key employees could have adverse impacts on our business and results of operations.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P6_S11	As our business grows and we open new stores, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees and develop, train, and manage an increasing number of management-level, sales, and other employees.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P6_S12	Competition for qualified employees is intense.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P6_S13	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain employees as needed in the future.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P6_S14	Our results of operations are subject to quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P6_S15	Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including, among other things:
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	timing of new pattern and collection releases and new product introductions.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Any quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	This could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	A data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, expose us to litigation risk and adversely affect our business.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We are dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet, for a significant portion of our sales, primarily through our e-commerce operations and credit card transaction authorization and processing.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We are also responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our e-commerce websites and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	As part of our normal course of business, we often collect, retain, and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information, over public networks.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	There is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Despite the security measures we currently have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Any electronic or physical security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, including penetration of our network security, whether by us or by a third-party, could disrupt our business, severely damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, expose us to risks of litigation and liability and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We do not control third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will not occur in the future.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility, reduce our e-commerce net sales, impair our ability to attract website visitors and reduce our ability to attract and retain customers.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P10_S5	We may also incur significant costs in complying with the various applicable state, federal and foreign laws regarding unauthorized disclosure of personal information.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P10_S7	We are dependent on our computer systems to record and process transactions and manage and operate our business, including in designing, marketing, manufacturing, importing, tracking and distributing our products, processing payments, and accounting for and reporting results.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P10_S8	We also utilize an automated replenishment system to facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders, the movement of goods through distribution channels, and the collection of information for planning and forecasting.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P10_S9	In addition, we have an e-commerce website in the U.S. Given the complexity of our business and the significant number of transactions that we engage in on an annual basis, it is imperative that we maintain constant operation of our computer hardware and software systems.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P10_S10	Despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from, among other things, security breaches, computer viruses or power outages.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P10_S11	Any material disruptions in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We are exposed to business risks as a result of our e-commerce operations.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We operate an e-commerce store at www.verabradley.com.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Expanding our e-commerce business is one of the key objectives of our business strategy.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Our e-commerce operations are subject to numerous risks, including unanticipated operating problems, reliance on third-party computer hardware and software providers, system failures and the need to invest in additional computer systems.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Specific risks include: (i) diversion of sales from our stores; (ii) rapid technological change; (iii) liability for e-commerce content; and (iv) risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate the websites and their related support systems, including from computer viruses, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Internet operations involve risks which may be beyond our control that could have a direct material adverse effect on our operating results, including: (i) price competition involving the items we intend to sell; (ii) the entry of our vendors into the Internet business in direct competition with us; (iii) the level of merchandise returns experienced by us; (iv) governmental regulation; (v) e-commerce security breaches involving unauthorized access to our and/or customer information; (vi) credit card fraud; and (vii) competition and general economic conditions specific to the Internet, e-commerce and the accessories industry.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Our inability to effectively address these risks and any other risks that we face in connection with our Internet operations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Closing stores could result in significant costs to us.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Since December 2014, we have closed three underperforming stores and could, in the future, decide to close additional stores that are producing losses or that are not as profitable as we expect.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P11_S9	If we decide to close any stores before the expiration of their lease terms, we may incur payments to landlords to terminate or buy out the remaining term of the lease.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P11_S10	We also may incur costs related to the employees at such stores, whether or not we terminate the leases early.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	costs, including fixed assets and inventory write-downs, could adversely affect our results and could adversely affect our cash on hand.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our Company's ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping centers in which many of our stores are located.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Substantially all of our Direct stores are located in regional mall shopping centers, and many of our Indirect customers are also located in these shopping centers.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Factors beyond our control impact mall traffic, such as general economic conditions and consumer spending levels.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Consumer spending and mall traffic have been depressed in recent years.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	As a result, mall operators have been facing increasing operational and financial difficulties.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The increasing inability of mall anchor tenants and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic around our stores, the increasing inability of mall operators to attract anchor tenants and maintain viable operations and the increasing departures of existing anchor and other mall tenants due to declines in the sales volume and in the popularity of certain malls as shopping destinations, have reduced and may continue to reduce our sales volume and, consequently, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We lease all of our store locations.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We typically occupy our stores under operating leases with terms of ten years.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We have been able to negotiate favorable rental rates in recent years due in part to the state of the economy and high vacancy rates within some shopping centers, but there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to negotiate such favorable terms.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Some of our leases have early cancellation clauses, which permit the lease to be terminated by us or the landlord if certain sales levels are not met in specific periods or if the shopping center does not meet specified occupancy standards.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	In addition to requiring future minimum lease payments, some of our store leases provide for the payment of common area maintenance charges, real property insurance, and real estate taxes.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Many of our lease agreements have escalating rent provisions over the initial term and any extensions.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P15_S7	As we expand our store base, our lease expense and our cash outlays for rent under lease agreements will increase.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including:
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	limiting our ability to obtain additional financing.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Any of these consequences could place us at a disadvantage with respect to our competitors.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We depend on cash flow from operating activities to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses and needs, we may not be able to service our lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would harm our business.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Additional sites that we lease may be subject to long-term non-cancelable leases if we are unable to negotiate our current standard lease terms.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, including paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Moreover, even if a lease has an early cancellation clause, we may not satisfy the contractual requirements for early cancellation under the lease.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Our inability to enter new leases or renew existing leases on acceptable terms or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that we close would, in any such case, affect us adversely.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our failure to effectively compete with other retailers for sales could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The market for bags, accessories, and travel items is increasingly competitive.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	establishing and maintaining good working relationships with our Indirect retailers.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In our Indirect business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers, and distributors of handbags, accessories, and other products for the limited space available for the display of such products to the consumer.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In our Direct business, we compete against other gift and specialty retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In addition, in light of a continued difficult consumer environment, pricing is a significant driver of consumer choice in our industry and we regularly engage in price competition, particularly through our promotional programs.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P20_S5	To the extent that we decrease our promotional activity, our ability to maintain sales levels may be impacted.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P20_S6	We rely on various contract manufacturers to produce all of our products and generally do not have long-term contracts with our manufacturers.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P20_S7	Disruptions in our contract manufacturers systems, losses of manufacturing certifications, or other actions by these manufacturers could increase our cost of sales, adversely affect our net revenues, and injure our reputation and customer relationships, thereby harming our business.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Our various contract manufacturers produce all of our products.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P20_S9	We generally do not enter into long-term formal written agreements with our manufacturers and instead transact business with each of them on an order-by-order basis.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P20_S10	In the event of a disruption in our contract manufacturers systems, we may be unable to locate alternative manufacturers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P20_S11	Identifying a suitable manufacturer is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with the prospective manufacturer s quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability, labor practices and environmental compliance.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P20_S12	Any delay, interruption, or increased cost in the manufactured products that might occur for any reason, such as the lack of long-term contracts or regulatory requirements and the loss of certifications, power interruptions, fires, hurricanes, war, or threats of terrorism, could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products, adversely affect our net revenues, increase our cost of sales, and hurt our results of operations.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P20_S13	In addition, manufacturing disruption could injure our reputation and customer relationships, thereby harming our business.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We rely on various suppliers to supply a significant majority of our raw materials.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Disruption in the supply of raw materials could increase our cost of goods sold and if there are not sufficient raw materials available to meet product demand, our product revenue could decline.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We generally do not enter into long-term formal written agreements with our suppliers and typically transact business with each of them on an order-by-order basis.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	In the event of a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from our current sources, we may not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P21_S4	In such a case, we could have difficulty meeting consumer demand and net revenues could be adversely impacted.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We rely on a single distribution facility for all of the products we sell.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Disruption to that facility could adversely impact our results of operations, and expansion of that facility could have unpredictable adverse effects.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Our distribution operations are currently concentrated in a single, company-owned distribution center in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Any significant disruption in the operation of the facility due to natural disaster or severe weather, or events such as fire, accidents, power outages, system failures, or other unforeseen causes, could devalue or damage a significant portion of our inventory and could adversely affect our product distribution and sales until such time as we could secure an alternative facility.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P22_S4	If we encounter difficulties with our distribution facility or other problems or disasters arise, we cannot ensure that critical systems and operations will be restored in a timely manner or at all, and this would have a material adverse effect on our business.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P22_S5	In addition, our growth could require us to further expand our current facility, which could affect us adversely in ways that we cannot predict.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P22_S6	The cost of raw materials could increase our cost of sales and cause our results of operations to suffer.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Fluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of fabrics or other raw materials used to manufacture our products, as well as the price for labor, marketing, and transportation, could have adverse impacts on our cost of sales and our ability to meet our customers demands.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P22_S8	In particular, fluctuations in the price of cotton, our primary raw material, could have an adverse impact on our cost of sales.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P22_S9	In addition, because a key component of our products is petroleum-based, the cost of oil affects the cost of our products.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P22_S10	Upward movement in the price of oil in the global oil markets would also likely result in rising fuel and freight prices, which could increase our shipping costs.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P22_S11	In the future, we may not be able to pass all or a portion of higher costs on to our customers.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing and manufacturing activities.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We source our fabrics primarily from manufacturers in China and South Korea and outsource the production of a significant majority of our products to companies in Asia.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We are subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing and manufacturing, including, but not limited to:
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	natural disasters, acts of war and terrorism, changing macroeconomic trends, and other external factors over which we have no control.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Additionally, we do not have complete oversight over our contract manufacturers.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Violation of labor or other laws by those manufacturers, or the divergence of a contract manufacturer s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States or in other markets in which we may in the future do business, could also draw negative publicity for us and our brand, diminishing the value of our brand and reducing demand for our products.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Our ability to source our products at favorable prices, or at all, could be harmed, with adverse effects on our results of operations, if new trade restrictions are imposed or if existing trade restrictions become more burdensome.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	A significant majority of our products are currently manufactured for us in Asia.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The United States and the countries in which our products are produced have imposed and may impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or regulations or may adversely adjust prevailing quotas, duties, or tariffs.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Countries impose, modify, and remove tariffs and other trade restrictions in response to a diverse array of factors, including global and national economic and political conditions, which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other trade restrictions.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Trade restrictions, which include embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us or could require us to modify our supply chain organization or other current business practices, any of which could harm our results of operations.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	We may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Currently, none of our employees are represented by a union.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Nevertheless, our employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to organize or affiliate with a union.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P26_S6	If some or all of our workforce were to become unionized, our business would be exposed to work stoppages and slowdowns as a unionized business.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P26_S7	If, in addition, the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly more favorable to union workers than our current pay-and-benefits arrangements, our costs would increase and our results of operations would suffer.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P26_S8	We rely on independent transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We currently rely on independent transportation service providers for substantially all of our product shipments.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our utilization of these delivery services, or those of any other shipping companies that we may elect to use, is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, employee strikes and inclement weather, which may impact the shipping company s ability to provide delivery services sufficient to meet our shipping needs.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	If for any reason we were to change shipping companies, we could face logistical difficulties that might adversely affect deliveries, and we would incur costs and expend resources in the course of making the change.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Moreover, we might not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from the service providers that we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P27_S4	We also would face shipping and distribution risks and uncertainties associated with any expansion of our distribution facility and related systems.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our inability or failure to protect our intellectual property or our infringement of other s intellectual property could have a negative impact on our operating results.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We believe that our registered copyrights, registered and common law trademarks, and other proprietary rights have significant value and are critical to our ability to create and sustain demand for our products.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Although we have not been inhibited from selling our products in connection with intellectual property disputes, we cannot assure you that obstacles will not arise as we expand our product line and extend our brand as well as the geographic scope of our sales and marketing.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We also cannot assure you that the actions taken by us to establish and protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products or infringement of our rights by others.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P28_S4	The legal regimes of some foreign countries, particularly China, may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by others in these countries.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P28_S5	The loss of copyrights, trademarks, and other proprietary rights could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P28_S6	Any litigation regarding our proprietary rights could be time consuming and costly.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P28_S7	We are also subject to the risk that claims will be brought against us for infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties, seeking to block the sale of our products considered to violate their intellectual property rights or payment of monetary amounts.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P28_S8	In particular, we are subject to copyright infringement claims for which we may not be entitled to indemnification from our suppliers.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P28_S9	In addition, in recent years, companies in the retail industry, including us, have been subject to patent infringement claims from non-practicing entities, or patent trolls.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P28_S10	Any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming and result in costly litigation.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P28_S11	As a result, any such claim, or the combination of multiple claims, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P28_S12	If we are required to stop using any of our registered or nonregistered trademarks, our sales could decline and, consequently, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P28_S13	Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results and stock price.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We are subject to income taxes in many U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which includes reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Further, possible changes in federal, state, local, and non-U.S. tax laws bearing upon our revenues, income, property, or other aspects of our operations or business would, if enacted, affect our results of operations in ways and to a degree that we cannot currently predict.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The results of the November 2016 U.S. elections have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The majority of our finished goods products, not sourced through licenses or strategic partners, are manufactured by a variety of global manufacturers located primarily in China, Vietnam and Cambodia.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We have recorded asset impairment charges in the past and we may record material asset impairment charges in the future.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Quarterly, we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If we determine that the carrying value of long-lived assets is not recoverable, we will be required to record impairment charges relating to those assets.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	For example, our assessments during fiscal 2017 indicated that operating losses or insufficient operating income existed at certain retail stores, with a projection that the operating losses or insufficient operating income for those locations would continue.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	As such, we recorded non-cash charges of $12.7 million during fiscal 2017 within selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations to write down the carrying values of these stores' long-lived assets to their estimated fair values.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Our quarterly evaluation of store assets includes consideration of current and historical performance and projections of future profitability.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P34_S5	The profitability projections rely upon estimates made by us, including store-level sales, gross margins, and direct expenses, and, by their nature, include judgments about how current strategic initiatives will impact future performance.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P34_S6	If we are not able to achieve the projected key financial metrics for any reason, including because any of the strategic initiatives being implemented do not result in significant improvements in our current financial performance trend, this would indicate that the value of our long-lived assets was not recoverable and we would incur additional impairment of assets in the future.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P34_S7	In the event we record additional impairment charges, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our Indirect business could suffer as a result of decisions by our Indirect retailers to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We do not enter into long-term agreements with any of our Indirect retailers.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers for each of our lines every season.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S3	A decision by a significant number of Indirect retailers, whether motivated by competitive conditions, operational or financial difficulties, reduced access to capital, or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or to change their manner of doing business with us could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Although we recommend retail sale prices for our products to our Indirect retailers, we do not provide dealer allowances or other economic incentives to support those prices.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Possible promotional pricing or discounting by Indirect retailers in response to softening retail demand could have a negative effect on our brand image and prestige, which might be difficult to counteract as the economy improves.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S6	Bankruptcies or other operational or financial difficulties of our Indirect retailers could adversely impact our business.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S7	We sell our Indirect merchandise primarily to specialty retail and department stores across the United States and extend trade credit based on an evaluation of each Indirect retailer s financial condition, usually without requiring collateral.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S8	Perceived or actual financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer or could decrease demand for our products by that customer.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S9	Pending the resolution of a relationship with a financially troubled Indirect retailer, we might assume credit risk that we would otherwise avoid relating to our receivables from that customer.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S10	Inability to collect on accounts receivable from our Indirect retailers would adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S11	There are claims made against us from time to time that can result in litigation or regulatory proceedings, which could distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability or damage to our brand image.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S12	As a growing company with expanding operations, we increasingly face the risk of litigation and other claims against us.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S13	Litigation and other claims may arise in the ordinary course of our business and include employee claims, custom and duty claims, commercial disputes, intellectual property issues, product-oriented allegations, and slip and fall claims.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S14	Often these cases raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S15	Litigation and other claims against us could result in unexpected expenses and liability, as well as materially adversely affect our operations and our reputation.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S16	We may suffer negative publicity and our business may be harmed if we need to recall any products we sell.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S17	We have in the past needed to, and may in the future need to, recall products that we determine may present safety issues.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S18	If products we sell have safety problems of which we are not aware, or if we or the Consumer Product Safety Commission recall a product sold in our stores, we may suffer negative publicity and, potentially, product liability lawsuits, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations or cash flows.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S19	Risks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock Our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell shares at or above the price at which you purchase them.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P35_S20	The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	These and other factors may result in a lower market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	In addition, the stock markets, including The Nasdaq Global Select Market, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many retail companies.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Over the last few years, proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies in retail businesses.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We could become engaged in a consent solicitation, or proxy contest, or experience other stockholder activism, in the future.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Activist shareholders may advocate for certain governance and strategic changes at our company.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	In the event of stockholder activism, particularly with respect to matters which our Board of Directors, in exercising their fiduciary duties, disagree with or have determined not to pursue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management, and perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners and customers.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	In addition, if faced with a consent solicitation or proxy contest, we may not be able to respond successfully to the contest or dispute, which would be disruptive to our business.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P39_S3	If individuals are elected to our Board with a differing agenda, our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders may be adversely affected.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P39_S4	A limited number of shareholders control a large percentage of the voting power of our common stock, and therefore investors may have limited ability to determine the outcome of shareholder votes.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Michael Ray (our former CEO and Ms. Bradley Baekgaard's son in-law), Robert Hall, Barbara Bradley Baekgaard, Joan Hall (Mr. Hall s wife and Ms. Bradley Baekgaard s daughter), Patricia R. Miller and P. Michael Miller, directly or indirectly, beneficially own and have the ability to exercise voting control over, in the aggregate, 40.8% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of January 28, 2017 .
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P39_S6	As a result, these shareholders are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, any amendments to our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and significant corporate transactions.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P39_S7	This concentrated ownership of outstanding common stock may limit your ability to influence corporate matters, and the interests of these shareholders may not coincide with our interests or your interests.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P39_S8	As a result, we may take actions that you do not believe to be in our interests or your interests and that could depress our stock price.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P39_S9	In addition, this significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock should investors perceive disadvantages in owning shares of common stock in a company that has such concentrated ownership.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	From time to time, we provide guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management s estimates as of the date of release.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in the release.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed, but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P41_S3	We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data are forecast.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P43_S3	In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Indiana law may discourage or prevent a change in control, even if a sale of the Company would be beneficial to our shareholders, which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by shareholders to replace or remove our current management.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control, discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock, harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.

1495320_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	As permitted by our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, our board of directors also has the ability, should they so determine, to adopt a shareholder rights agreement, sometimes called a poison pill, providing for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common stock.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	In the event of a takeover attempt, this preferred stock would give rights to holders of common stock (other than the potential acquirer) to buy additional shares of common stock at a discount, leading to the dilution of the potential acquirer s stake.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The adoption of a poison pill, or the board s ability to do so, can have negative effects such as those described above.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	As an Indiana corporation, we are governed by the Indiana Business Corporation Law (as amended from time to time, the IBCL ).
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Under specified circumstances, certain provisions of the IBCL related to control share acquisitions, business combinations and constituent interests may delay, prevent or make more difficult unsolicited acquisitions or changes of control of us.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	These provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our management.
1495320_17_ITEM1A_P47_S3	It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that shareholders might deem to be in their best interest.

1495320_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	How We Assess the Performance of Our Business In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures.

1495320_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	As a result, data in this report regarding our comparable sales and comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other companies.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	Non-comparable sales include sales from stores not included in comparable sales or comparable store sales.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Measuring the change in year-over-year comparable sales allows us to evaluate how our store base and e-commerce operations are performing.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	Various factors affect our comparable sales, including:

1495320_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	In recent years, comparable store sales have declined.

1495320_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Gross profit can be impacted by changes in volume; fluctuations in sales price; operational efficiencies, such as leveraging of fixed costs; promotional activities, such as free shipping; commodity prices, such as cotton prices; and labor costs.

1495320_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Average net revenues per gross square foot are calculated by dividing total net revenues for our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the period by total gross square footage for those stores.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	On September 15, 2016, we received information from law enforcement regarding a potential data security issue related to our retail store network.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	Findings from the investigation show unauthorized access to our payment processing system and the installation of a program that looked for payment card data.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	The program was specifically designed to find track data in the magnetic stripe of a payment card that may contain the card number, cardholder name, expiration date, and internal verification code as the data was being routed through the affected payment system.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P27_S3	There is no indication that other customer information was at risk.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P27_S4	Payment cards used at Vera Bradley store locations between July 25, 2016 and September 23, 2016 may have been affected.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P27_S5	Not all cards used in stores during this time frame were affected.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P27_S6	Cards used on verabradley.com were not affected.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P27_S7	We have resolved this incident and continue to work with the computer security firm to further strengthen the security of our systems to help prevent this from happening in the future.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P27_S8	We continue to support law enforcement s investigation and also promptly notified the payment card networks so that the banks that issue payment cards could initiate heightened monitoring on the affected cards.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P27_S9	Expenses Incurred and Amounts Accrued During fiscal 2017, we recorded an immaterial amount of expense relating to the Payment Card Incident.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P27_S10	Expenses included costs to investigate the Payment Card Incident and obtain legal and other professional services.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Future Costs We expect to incur additional legal and professional services, as well as expenses and capital investments for remediation activities associated with the Payment Card Incident and will recognize the expenses as incurred.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	In addition, payment card companies and associations may require us to reimburse them for unauthorized card charges and costs to replace cards and may also impose fines or penalties in connection with the Payment Card Incident, and enforcement authorities may also impose fines or other remedies against us.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss or range of loss related to any fines or penalties that may be assessed.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P28_S3	The Payment Card Incident, including customer response and any possible third party claims or assessments from payment card companies, could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P28_S4	We expect that our insurance coverage will offset most of the expenses for the investigation and other non-remediation legal and professional services associated with the incident, possible third party claims, as well as fines, penalties, or other expenses, if any, imposed by payment card companies, as discussed above.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P28_S5	We maintain $15.0 million of cyber security insurance coverage above a $0.1 million deductible.

1495320_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	See Note 15 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, herein, for additional information.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	Impairment Charges Property, plant, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	The reviews are conducted at the lowest identifiable level of cash flows.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the property, plant, and equipment are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, as further defined in Note 2 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, herein.

1495320_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	This change resulted from a $28.0 million contribution of revenue from our non-comparable stores, which included ten additional stores in the current year, partially offset by a comparable sales decrease of $23.7 million , or 7.0% .
1495320_17_ITEM7_P34_S3	The decrease in comparable sales includes a 6.7% decrease in e-commerce sales and a 7.1% decrease in comparable store sales.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P34_S4	The decline in comparable sales was primarily due to year-over-year declines in store and e-commerce traffic, as well as lower levels of promotional activity in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P34_S5	The aggregate number of full-line and factory outlet stores grew from 150 at the end of fiscal 2016 to 159 at the end of fiscal 2017 , which excludes one store closed at the end of the fourth quarter.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P34_S6	For fiscal 2017 , net revenues decreased $20.5 million , or 13.6% , to $130.8 million , from $151.3 million for fiscal 2016 , primarily due to lower orders from specialty retail accounts.

1495320_17_ITEM7_P34_S9	The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to sourcing efficiencies (partly due to reduced overhead costs resulting from the closing of our domestic manufacturing facility), partially offset by increased promotional activity at our factory outlet stores.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P34_S10	In addition, gross profit in the first quarter of the comparable prior-year period was impacted by restructuring charges of $3.4 million related to the closure of our manufacturing facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, as discussed in more detail in Note 15 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P34_S11	For fiscal 2017 , SG A expenses increased $12.4 million , or 5.2% , to $249.2 million , from $236.8 million for fiscal 2016 .

1495320_17_ITEM7_P34_S14	In addition, the first quarter of the prior-year period included $1.2 million in expense related to a retail store early termination agreement which did not recur in the current-year period.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P34_S15	SG A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to the aforementioned items and fixed expenses being spread over lower comparable sales and deleveraging of store operating expenses as a result of lower comparable store sales.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P34_S16	Other Income For fiscal 2017 , other income decreased $1.1 million , or 43.9% , to $1.3 million , from $2.4 million for fiscal 2016 , primarily due to a decrease in participation in the co-op mailer program.

1495320_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	income as a percentage of Direct segment net revenues was primarily due to $10.0 million in incremental store impairment charges, $7.1 million in new store expenses, and deleveraging of store operating expenses as a result of lower comparable store sales, partially offset by $3.5 million in restructuring and other charges related to the closure of our manufacturing facility and a retail store early termination agreement in the comparable prior-year period, as well as an increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, as described above.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	For fiscal 2017 , operating income decreased $9.5 million , or 15.6% .

1495320_17_ITEM7_P36_S8	The year-over year decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the release of approximately $1.6 million of certain income tax reserves as a result the conclusion of an IRS audit.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P36_S9	The prior year included $0.6 million of income tax reserves for uncertain tax positions related to research and development tax credits.

1495320_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Net Revenues For fiscal 2016, net revenues decreased $6.4 million, or 1.3%, to $502.6 million, from $509.0 million for fiscal 2015.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	For fiscal 2016, net revenues increased $15.7 million, or 4.7%, to $351.3 million, from $335.6 million for fiscal 2015.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P37_S2	This change resulted from a $51.3 million contribution of revenue from our non-comparable stores, which included 26 additional stores in the current year, partially offset by a comparable sales decrease of $33.7 million, or 10.6% and a gift card breakage revenue decrease of $1.1 million.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P37_S3	Fiscal 2015 was the first year gift card breakage revenue was recognized; refer to Note 2, herein, for additional information.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P37_S4	The decrease in comparable sales includes a 13.2% decrease in e-commerce sales and an 8.6% decrease in comparable store sales, primarily as a result of reduced traffic.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P37_S5	There was also a decrease in sales at our annual outlet sale compared to the prior fiscal year.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P37_S6	We believe the year-over-year traffic declines in e-commerce and stores are due, at least in part, to our intentional reduction of promotional activity.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	The aggregate number of full-line and factory outlet stores grew from 125 at the end of fiscal 2015, to 150 at the end of fiscal 2016, which includes the closure of one full-line store in fiscal 2016.

1495320_17_ITEM7_P38_S3	As a percentage of net revenues, gross profit increased to 55.9% for fiscal 2016, from 52.9% for fiscal 2015.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P38_S4	The year-over-year increase in the gross margin rate was primarily related to sourcing efficiencies (lower product costs combined with Fall 2014 cost reductions at the Company s domestic manufacturing facility as well as leverage of overhead costs resulting from an increase in units manufactured), increased sales penetration of higher-margin made-for-outlet products, reduced promotional activity and lower levels of liquidation sales.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P38_S5	Gross profit during fiscal 2016 was impacted by restructuring charges of $3.4 million related to the closure of our manufacturing facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, as discussed in more detail in Note 15 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein.

1495320_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	The remaining increase was primarily due to investments in new stores, $6.0 million in incremental marketing and advertising, $2.7 million in additional incentive compensation, as well as $2.3 million in incremental store impairment charges.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P39_S4	SG A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to the aforementioned items, as well as fixed expenses being spread over lower revenues and deleveraging of store operating expenses as a result of lower comparable store sales.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P39_S5	Other Income For fiscal 2016, other income decreased $1.3 million, or 36.6%, to $2.4 million from $3.7 million for fiscal 2015, primarily due to a decrease in participation in the co-op mailer program.

1495320_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	We also have access to additional liquidity, if needed, through availability under our $125.0 million second amended and restated credit agreement.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Historically, our primary cash needs have been for merchandise inventories; payroll; store rent; capital expenditures associated with operational equipment, buildings, information technology, opening new stores; share repurchases; and debt repayments.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	The most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, merchandise inventories, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current liabilities.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	We believe that cash on hand and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities, short-term investments, and the availability of borrowings under our second amended and restated credit agreement or other financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, share repurchases, and debt payments for the foreseeable future.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Short-Term Investments Short-term investments consist of a certificate of deposit with an original maturity of one year and a one-time option to accelerate maturity to 31 days without penalty.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	Interest income from the investment is included in interest expense, net, in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

1495320_17_ITEM7_P44_S4	Cash Flow Analysis A summary of operating, investing, and financing activities is shown in the following table (in thousands):
1495320_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation, the effect of changes in assets and liabilities, and tenant-improvement allowances received from landlords under our store leases.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities was $65.2 million during fiscal 2017 , as compared to $43.3 million during fiscal 2016 .
1495320_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of the timing of inventory receipts in the current-year period, which resulted in a source of cash for the current-year period of $11.3 million , as compared to an inventory build in the comparable prior-year period for made-for-outlet product, which resulted in a use of cash of $15.2 million in the comparable prior-year period.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P45_S3	In addition, accounts payable resulted in a source of cash for the current-year period of $9.0 million , as compared to a use of cash of $8.7 million in the comparable prior-year period, primarily due to the timing of inventory payments.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P45_S4	These sources of cash were partially offset by a change in income taxes which resulted in a use of cash of $12.0 million in the current-year period as compared to a source of cash of $12.5 million in the comparable prior-year period.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P45_S5	The income tax change was primarily a result of the timing of an $11.5 million federal income tax payment in the current-year period, as well as incremental payments as a result of increased income at certain points in time during the current year.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P45_S6	In the comparable prior-year period, net income included cash payments of approximately $2.6 million for restructuring activities related to the closure of our domestic manufacturing facility which did not recur in the current period.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P45_S7	These payments consisted of $1.7 million for severance and benefits, $0.7 million for a lease termination and $0.2 million in other associated costs.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P45_S8	Net cash provided by operating activities was $43.3 million during fiscal 2016, as compared to $103.8 million during fiscal 2015.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P45_S9	The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in net income of $10.9 million and changes in assets and liabilities which provided an $8.8 million use of cash as compared to a $45.3 million source of cash in the prior year, primarily as a result of inventories, accounts payable and income taxes.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Investing activities consist primarily of short-term investments and capital expenditures for growth related to new store openings, buildings, operational equipment, and information technology investments.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	Net cash used in investing activities was $50.8 million in fiscal 2017 , compared to $26.3 million in fiscal 2016 .
1495320_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	The increase in cash used in investing activities was due to a $30.0 million short-term investment in a certificate of deposit made in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, partially offset by a decrease in property, plant, and equipment spending compared to the prior-year period.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P46_S3	The decrease in property, plant, and equipment spending was primarily a result of ten new stores opened in the current-year period as compared to 26 stores in the comparable prior-year period, as well as spending for the campus consolidation in the prior-year period which did not recur in the current-year period, partially offset by an increase in information technology investments, including spending for our e-commerce platform upgrade.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P46_S4	Net cash used in investing activities was $26.3 million in fiscal 2016, compared to $37.1 million in fiscal 2015.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P46_S5	The $10.8 million decrease in capital expenditures was driven primarily by the campus consolidation which was substantially completed in fiscal 2015.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P46_S6	Capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $10.0 million to $15.0 million .
1495320_17_ITEM7_P46_S7	Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $25.7 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $31.5 million in fiscal 2016 .
1495320_17_ITEM7_P46_S8	The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to $25.0 million of cash purchases of our common stock under the 2015 Share Repurchase Plan in the current-year period compared to $30.9 million of cash purchases of our common stock under the 2015 and 2014 Share Repurchase Plans in the prior-year period.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P46_S9	Net cash used in financing activities was $31.5 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $13.6 million in fiscal 2015.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P46_S10	The $17.9 million increase in financing activities was primarily due to the completion of purchases of shares of the Company's common stock made under the 2014 Share Repurchase Program, as well as purchases under the 2015 Share Repurchase Program.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	The Credit Agreement provides for certain credit facilities to VBD in an aggregate principal amount not to initially exceed $125.0 million, the proceeds of which will be used for general corporate purposes of VBD and its subsidiaries, including but not limited to Vera Bradley International, LLC and Vera Bradley Sales, LLC (collectively, the Named Subsidiaries ).
1495320_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	Amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at VBD's option, at a per annum rate equal to either (A) the Alternate Base Rate ( ABR ) plus the Applicable Margin, where the ABR is the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and (iii) Adjusted LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1%, and the Applicable Margin is a percentage ranging from 0.00% to 0.70% depending upon the Company's leverage ratio or (B) Adjusted LIBOR plus the Applicable Margin, where Adjusted LIBOR means LIBOR, as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities, and Applicable Margin is a percentage ranging from 1.00% to 1.70% depending upon the Company's leverage ratio.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	Any loans made, or letters of credit issued, pursuant to the Credit Agreement mature on July 15, 2020.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	As of January 28, 2017 , the Company had no borrowings and availability of $125.0 million under the agreement.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	VBD's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and the Named Subsidiaries.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P48_S3	The obligations of VBD under the Credit Agreement are secured by first priority security interests in all of the respective assets of VBD, the Company, and the Named Subsidiaries and a pledge of the equity interests of VBD and the Named Subsidiaries.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	The Credit Agreement contains various restrictive covenants, including restrictions on the Company's ability to dispose of assets, make acquisitions or investments, incur debt or liens, make distributions to stockholders or repurchase outstanding stock, enter into related party transactions and make capital expenditures, other than upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	The Company is also required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum ratio of EBITDAR to the sum of interest expense plus rentals (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and a limit on capital expenditures.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	Upon an event of default, which includes certain customary events such as, among other things, a failure to make required payments when due, a failure to comply with covenants, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, a material adverse change (as defined in the Credit Agreement), defaults under other material indebtedness, and a change in control, the lenders may accelerate amounts outstanding, terminate the agreement and foreclose on all collateral.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P49_S3	The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of January 28, 2017 .
1495320_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	We enter into long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily non-cancellable operating leases.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	As of January 28, 2017 , our contractual cash obligations over the next several periods are as follows:
1495320_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	(1) Our store leases are generally ten years with varying renewal options.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	Our future operating lease obligations would change if we were to extend these leases, or if we were to enter into new operating leases.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	(2) Purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	(3) Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our uncertain tax positions at January 28, 2017 , we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	Therefore, $0.9 million of uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosures relating to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	We evaluate our accounting policies, estimates, and judgments on an on-going basis.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	We evaluate the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and believe that the following policies and estimates involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position, and are therefore discussed as critical.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	The following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent results of operations.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	Our historical results for the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, however, have not been materially impacted by such variances.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	More information on all of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from the sale of our products is recognized upon customer receipt of the product when collection of the associated receivables is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and ownership and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, which, for e-commerce and most Indirect sales, reflects an estimate of shipments that customers have not yet received.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	The adjustment of these shipments is based on actual delivery dates to the customer.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	Significant changes in shipping terms or delivery times could materially impact our revenues in a given period.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	We reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	In the Direct business, returns are refunded by issuing the same payment tender of the original purchase and in the Indirect business the customer is issued a credit to its account to apply to outstanding invoices.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	Merchandise exchanges of the same product at the same price are not considered merchandise returns.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	Product returns are often resalable through our annual outlet sale or other channels.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	Additionally, we reserve for other potential product credits and for customer shipments not yet received.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P60_S3	The balance of the reserve for returns, customer shipments not yet received, and general credits was $6.2 million and $3.3 million as of January 28, 2017 , and January 30, 2016 , respectively.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	We sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers and do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	Gift cards that we issue are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed, at which point revenue is recognized.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P61_S2	In addition, we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	We determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	During the fiscal years ended January 28, 2017 , January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , the Company recorded $0.3 million , $0.3 million and $1.4 million of revenue related to gift card breakage, respectively.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P63_S2	Market is determined based on net realizable value, which includes costs to dispose.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P63_S3	Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excess quantities, and other factors, including the popularity of a pattern or product, in evaluating net realizable value.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	We record valuation adjustments to our inventories, which are reflected in cost of sales, if the cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	This adjustment calculation requires us to make assumptions and estimates, which are based on factors such as merchandise seasonality, historical trends, and estimated sales and inventory levels, including sell-through of remaining units.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P64_S2	In addition, as part of inventory adjustments, we provide for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from our physical inventory counts.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P64_S3	We perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrinkage provision accordingly.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P64_S4	The balance of inventory adjustments was $2.6 million and $5.5 million for these matters as of the fiscal years ended January 28, 2017 , and January 30, 2016 , respectively.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P64_S5	These adjustments related primarily to raw materials of retired patterns and styles and merchandise from the baby gift category, which was discontinued by the Company, and technology accessories.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P64_S6	The reduction in inventory adjustments primarily related to the destruction of certain raw materials and finished goods no longer needed or deemed salable, as well as the sell-through of retired finished goods.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P64_S7	We have the ability to move retired finished goods through a number of channels, including the annual outlet sale, our website and factory outlet stores, and through third-party liquidators as needed.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is based on our pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P65_S2	We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained; (2) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	Taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	We believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P66_S2	Taxing authorities, however, may take a contrary position.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P66_S3	Our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if, upon final resolution with taxing authorities, we prevail in positions for which we have established reserves, or are required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	The balance of the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) was $0.9 million , $3.1 million and $3.0 million as of January 28, 2017 , January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , respectively.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	A benefit of $1.9 million , an expense of $0.1 million and a benefit of $0.1 million was recognized in income tax expense for these matters during the fiscal years ended January 28, 2017 , January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , respectively.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	Valuation of Long-lived Assets Property, plant, and equipment assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	In evaluating an asset for recoverability, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset at the store level, the lowest identifiable level of cash flow, if applicable.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset is less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, usually determined by an estimated discounted cash flow analysis of the asset.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	Factors used in the valuation of long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, our plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results, and projected future cash flows.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	With respect to our stores, we analyze store economics, location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies in our selection process.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	Impairment charges are classified in SG A expenses and were $12.7 million , $2.8 million and $0.4 million for the periods ended January 28, 2017 , January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , respectively.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	The discounted cash flow models used to estimate the applicable fair values involve numerous estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	Changes to these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the fair value estimates.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P73_S2	The estimates and assumptions critical to the overall fair value estimates include: (1) estimated future cash flow generated at the store level; and (2) discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair values.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P73_S3	These and other estimates and assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and our expectations and may change in the future based on period-specific facts and circumstances.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P73_S4	If economic conditions were to deteriorate, future impairment charges may be required.
1495320_17_ITEM7_P73_S5	Transactions with Related Parties See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, of this report for information regarding transactions with related parties.
1495320_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our second amended and restated credit agreement, which bear interest at variable rates.
1495320_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The second amended and restated credit agreement allows for a revolving credit commitment of $125.0 million, bearing interest at a variable rate, based on (A) the ABR plus the Applicable Margin, where the ABR is the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and (iii) Adjusted LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1%, and the Applicable Margin is a percentage ranging from 0.00% to 0.70% depending upon the Company's leverage ratio or (B) Adjusted LIBOR plus the Applicable Margin, where Adjusted LIBOR means LIBOR, as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities, and Applicable Margin is a percentage ranging from 1.00% to 1.70% depending upon the Company's leverage ratio.
1495320_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Assuming borrowings available under the second amended and restated credit agreement are fully extended, each quarter point increase or decrease in the interest rate would change our annual interest expense by approximately $0.3 million.
1495320_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Impact of Inflation Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost.
1495320_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Although it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial.
1495320_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We source a majority of our materials from various suppliers primarily in China and South Korea.
1495320_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Substantially all purchases and sales involving foreign persons are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore we do not hedge using any derivative instruments.
1495320_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Historically, we have not been impacted materially by changes in exchange rates.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vera Bradley, Inc.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Vera Bradley, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of January 28, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P1_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1495320_17_ITEM8_P1_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P2_S3	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Vera Bradley, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 28, 2017, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended January 28, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P2_S4	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2017, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 28, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vera Bradley, Inc.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Vera Bradley, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of January 28, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P4_S1	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P5_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1495320_17_ITEM8_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P5_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P5_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P6_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P6_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P7_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P8_S0	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28,2017, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of January 28, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended of the Company and our report dated March 28, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Vera Bradley, Inc.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Vera Bradley, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 30, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended January 30, 2016.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P11_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P11_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P11_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

1495320_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P12_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P12_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1495320_17_ITEM8_P12_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Vera Bradley, Inc. and subsidiaries at January 30, 2016, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended January 30, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

1495320_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	Ms. Baekgaard continues to focus on various Vera Bradley-related projects.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P21_S2	Ms. Miller retired in October 2012 as our National Spokesperson, but continues to serve on the Board of Directors along with Ms. Baekgaard.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	Vision 20/20 Initiatives During fiscal 2018, we launched Vision 20/20 which is an aggressive plan to turnaround our business and restore brand and Company health over the next three years.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	Integrating our Vision 20/20 initiatives into our long-term strategic plan is expected to lay the foundation for growth, a more profitable future, and continued strong cash flows.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	The key focus of Vision 20/20 is moving to a significantly less clearance-driven business model combined with a meaningful reduction in SG A expenses.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	To move to a significantly less clearance driven business model, we are focusing on three key product and pricing initiatives: reducing the amount of clearance merchandise offered, narrowing our current product offerings, and introducing tighter assortment guardrails.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P23_S2	We will significantly reduce the amount of clearance merchandise offered on verabradley.com and in our full-line stores.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P23_S3	This will help to reset our customers pricing expectations and restore our full-price business.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P23_S4	To reduce certain clearance sales from verabradley.com, we began the use of our online outlet site in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 by conducting two flash sales.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P23_S5	We are focusing on our best categories and will narrow our current product offerings by eliminating unproductive or incongruent categories and SKUs from our assortments.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P23_S6	We began to narrow our product offerings in fiscal 2018 and are discontinuing our fragrance and jewelry collections in spring of fiscal 2019.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P23_S7	We are building tighter assortment guardrails around introducing new categories, patterns, and pricing, assuring the right fit for our brand and that our products not only provide thoughtful solutions but also reflect our signature attributes of being comfortable, casual, and affordable.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P23_S8	These initiatives should be reflected in our product by fall of fiscal 2019.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P23_S9	We expect these product and pricing initiatives to negatively affect revenues in fiscal 2019, but we believe these are the right actions to take for the future health of the business.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	As we reduce revenues, we will also continue to reduce SG A expenses.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	These SG A expense reductions began in fiscal 2018 by right-sizing our corporate and retail store infrastructure to align with the size of our business.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	Additional initiatives to reduce SG A expenses include continuing to identify corporate efficiencies, reducing our marketing expenses and optimizing return on marketing spending, and taking a more aggressive stance on reducing store operating expenses and closing underperforming stores.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P24_S3	We are forecasting to close up to 45 additional full-line stores (approximately 15 per year) by the end of fiscal 2021, primarily as leases expire.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P24_S4	We closed five underperforming full-line stores and one underperforming factory outlet store during fiscal 2018.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P24_S5	Our long-term vision is to build on the Company's rich heritage and establish Vera Bradley as a premium global lifestyle brand, expand our customer reach, and grow our customer connections.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P24_S6	Our long-term strategic plan, integrated with Vision 20/20, is centered upon the three planks of product, distribution, and marketing.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P24_S7	We call our target aspirational customer the Day Maker.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P24_S8	She is organized, thoughtful and, most of all, appreciates femininity and beauty - in color, print, and thoughtful details.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P24_S9	We are focused on creating thoughtful solutions for the Day Maker and believe we have a great opportunity to attract more Day Makers to our brand through our product offerings, our distribution channels, and our marketing efforts.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P24_S10	We have identified four key businesses where we can offer the Day Maker thoughtful solutions that we believe will propel our future growth.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P24_S11	We are optimizing our existing core portfolio by eliminating product categories and specific SKUs that are unproductive or incongruent, as well as expanding into relevant new categories that reflect our brand and signature attributes of comfortable, casual, and affordable.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P24_S12	We will continue to use licenses and strategic partnerships as appropriate to expand our product categories.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our Fashion Bag and Accessories business continues to be our largest opportunity and allows us to highlight our innovation, function, and fashion.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	Both patterns and solids are important in this category.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	Travel remains a core differentiator for Vera Bradley and allows us to both embrace our heritage and to showcase newness and functionality with products like Lighten Up and our unique collapsible luggage.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our Campus business including backpacks, has been successful, and we believe there are further opportunities to expand our Campus authority going forward.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	We believe Home can continue to be a significant growth opportunity for Vera Bradley, with market attractiveness and a great brand fit.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	The Day Maker s fashion statement is often her home.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	Licensing will continue to play a key role in the home area.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P30_S2	In each of these areas, fabric, pattern innovation, and newness remain critical in staying relevant.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	Vera Bradley products are available through our Direct channel including full-line and factory outlet stores, online through verabradley.com and our online outlet site, and our annual outlet sale, as well as through the Indirect channel including department and specialty retail stores, national accounts, third-party e-commerce sites, and third-party inventory liquidators.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	We continue to focus on tightly integrating our multi-channel business by strengthening and right-sizing both our Direct and Indirect distribution channels.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P31_S2	In 2007 and 2009, we opened our first full-line and factory outlet stores, respectively.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P31_S3	We believe there continues to be long-term opportunities for new stores throughout the United States.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P31_S4	We opened one new full-line pop-up store and six new factory outlet stores in fiscal 2018; however, we have slowed our short-term plans for new factory outlet store openings and suspended full-line store growth until we begin to produce comparable store sales growth.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P31_S5	We closed five underperforming full-line stores in fiscal 2018 and expect to close up to 45 additional underperforming full-line stores by fiscal 2021, primarily as leases expire.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P31_S6	During fiscal 2017 and 2018, we completed 34 full-line store renovations and updated the facade and exterior signage in an additional 14 full-line stores.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P31_S7	These renovations were made to our continuing locations.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P31_S8	Nearly 40 of our full-line stores reflect our new design aesthetic.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P31_S9	We plan to open six new factory outlet stores in fiscal 2019.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P31_S10	At February 3, 2018, nearly 80% of the product in the outlet channel was made specifically for our factory outlet stores.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P31_S11	This percentage is expected to increase in fiscal 2019.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	In 2006, we began selling directly to consumers through verabradley.com.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	Building our digital flagship remains a key part of our distribution strategy.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P32_S2	The redesign and conversion of our website to a new platform was completed in February 2017.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P32_S3	This new platform offers enhanced ease of shopping and incremental functionality.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	The GiftNow feature allows customers to purchase gifts from verabradley.com that can be modified by the recipient before shipment.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	The new platform also gives us capabilities to create deeper customer relationships and create value through more personalization and strategic customization.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P33_S2	As part of the Company's Vision 20/20 initiatives, we created an online outlet site during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to allow us to reduce clearance sales from verabradley.com.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P33_S3	In fiscal 2018, we had over 46 million visits to our website and our online outlet site.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P33_S4	Our department store relationships allow us to expose our brand to new customers and showcase our new product assortments.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P33_S5	We are currently in approximately 660 department store locations, including Dillard s, Macy's, Bon-Ton, Belk, and Von Maur.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P33_S6	In the department stores, we are continuing to work on enhancing our brand presentation and to explore expansion of our lifestyle brand offerings.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P33_S7	The specialty retail channel is the heritage of our business and remains important to us.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P33_S8	We continue to add select accounts while discontinuing unproductive accounts.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P33_S9	While the specialty retail business is becoming a smaller percentage of our total revenue base, we are working to stabilize it by assisting retailers with optimizing their businesses.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P33_S10	We had a small wholesale presence in Japan during fiscal 2018 with a licensed partner but will be exiting Japan in mid fiscal 2019.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P33_S11	We are exploring the possibility of expanding into other countries in the long-term but do not foresee any international country expansion in fiscal 2019.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	Marketing and brand positioning are both critical elements as we continue to engage new consumers and strengthen our bond with existing customers.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	We activated our new branding and brand positioning in fiscal 2017, which included updating elements of our visual identity such as our logo and further evolving our marketing to speak more directly to the Day Maker.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P34_S2	We increased our brand awareness in fiscal 2018 through our digital first strategy by partnering with key influencers and leveraging social media channels.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P34_S3	Well-timed and well-executed brand activation is critical to increasing our brand relevancy and increasing purchase intent.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P34_S4	Through comprehensive consumer research, we have designed a media plan that we believe effectively targets our Day Maker customers and attracts both lapsed and new Day Maker consumers to our brand.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P34_S5	Our media efforts include a fully-integrated mix of digital, social, experiential, and print, with our goal being to surround the Day Maker with our brand.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P34_S6	We reduced our marketing expenditures in fiscal 2018 by focusing on efficiencies and becoming more targeted while working to keep our most loyal customers engaged, as well as working to attract new consumers.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	Competitive Strengths We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us within the marketplace: Strong Brand Identity and Positioning.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	We believe the Vera Bradley brand is highly recognized for its distinctive and vibrant style.

1495320_18_ITEM1_P39_S5	To keep our assortment current and fresh, and to focus our inventory investments on our best performers, we discontinue prints and fabrications as necessary.

1495320_18_ITEM1_P44_S19	We will continue to look for the right strategic partners and licensees that can augment the brand and provide established distribution networks for certain categories of business.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	Marketing We believe that the growth of our brand and our business is influenced by our ability to introduce and sell our merchandise in a way that clearly conveys the Vera Bradley brand personality.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	We use marketing as a critical tool in our efforts to promote our brand.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	Vera Bradley communicates with our established customers consistently throughout the year with regular e-mails, social media, and seasonal direct mail catalogs, brochures, and notifications.

1495320_18_ITEM1_P46_S2	We primarily employ digital (i.e., display banner, mobile, geo-targeting, and pre-roll video) and print advertising to increase overall brand awareness and attract new customers.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P46_S3	Our advertisements are placed in fashion, lifestyle, and family publications and websites that complement the wide breadth of appeal of our brand.

1495320_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	In addition, we have expanded our public relations efforts to reach popular online influencers and bloggers.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	Product placement in feature-length films and on prime-time television shows remains strong with television placements in Life in Pieces , The Big Bang Theory , Blackish , Speechless, and American Housewife .

1495320_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	We work with high-profile partners to enhance our brand image and expand our customer reach.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	During fiscal 2017, we partnered with Madison Square Garden which, among other things, featured our new logo and video content.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	The show integrated our product and It s Good to be a Girl marketing campaign clips.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	One episode featured a challenge in which our co-founder, Barbara Bradley Baekgaard, was a guest judge.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	We use online marketing and social networking sites as tools to increase brand awareness and drive traffic to verabradley.com and to our stores.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	We have captured approximately 4.6 million active customer e-mail addresses in our online customer file, with many of these customers providing age, occupation, and location data.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P51_S2	This information provides us with deeper insight into the products and categories that are of the highest interest to our customers, and allows us to better target our customers with appropriate messages.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P51_S3	As of February 3, 2018 , we had approximately 1.8 million Facebook fans and approximately 84,000 Twitter followers.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P51_S4	Our Instagram, which we launched in October 2012, has grown to approximately 330,000 followers and is our most highly engaged social medium.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P51_S5	In addition, we often partner with brand-right bloggers to promote product.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P51_S6	Seasonal Vera Bradley catalogs are a vehicle for promoting our brand and product portfolio.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P51_S7	Each catalog is sent to a targeted customer mailing list.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P51_S8	In addition to distributing the catalog, we produce and distribute a number of other marketing pieces, including postcards and mini-mailers.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P51_S9	We believe our direct mail medium generates excitement and awareness about the brand and seasonal introductions and allows us to reach both new and loyal customers in their homes.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P51_S10	Seasonality Because Vera Bradley products are frequently given as gifts, we have historically realized, and expect to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of November and December.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P51_S11	In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	Channels of Distribution We distribute our products through our Direct and Indirect segments.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	This multi-channel distribution model is designed to enable operational flexibility and maximizes the methods by which we can access potential customers.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P52_S2	We have developed a retail presence through our full-line stores, all located in the United States, which provides us with a format to showcase our brand and the full array of Vera Bradley products.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P52_S3	As of February 3, 2018 , we operated 109 full-line stores averaging approximately 1,900 square feet per store.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P52_S4	In fiscal 2017, we opened our first flagship store in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City which offers customers a unique store experience, as well as exclusive product.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P52_S5	Our sales associates are passionate about our products and customer service, which, we believe, translates into a superior shopping experience.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P52_S6	Our factory outlet stores are a vehicle for selling factory exclusive styles, as well as retired merchandise at discounted prices, while maintaining brand integrity.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P52_S7	At the end of fiscal 2018 , nearly 80% of the merchandise found in our factory outlet stores was factory exclusive styles.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	We believe our factory outlet stores are an integral part of our distribution strategy, as this format provides an additional channel of distribution for our products and enables us to better target value-oriented customers.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	Our factory outlet stores average approximately 3,200 square feet per store.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P53_S2	As of February 3, 2018 , we operated 51 factory outlet stores, all located in the United States.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P53_S3	Our store location decisions for both full-line and factory outlet stores are made based upon our comprehensive retail strategy that includes actual and planned penetration in both Indirect and Direct segments, as well as existing e-commerce demand.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P53_S4	At this time, we do not believe all geographical markets have been fully penetrated by our distribution channels.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P53_S5	We believe that long-term expansion of our store base will increase brand awareness and reinforce our brand image.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	In addition to analyzing store economics, we pay particular attention to the location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P54_S1	Along with seeking co-tenants that we believe share our target customer, we seek a balanced mix of moderate and high-end retailers to encourage high levels of traffic.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P54_S2	Our target full-line store size is approximately 1,800 square feet and our target factory outlet store size is approximately 3,000 square feet.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P54_S3	The focus of our store operations is providing consumers with a comfortable and memorable shopping experience.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P54_S4	We strive to make the experience interactive through special store events, such as showcasing newly launched products or celebrating our namesake s birthday.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P54_S5	Our customer service philosophy emphasizes friendly service, merchandise knowledge, and passion for the brand.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P54_S6	Consequently, an essential requirement for the success of our stores is our ability to attract, train, and retain talented, highly motivated district managers, store managers, and sales associates.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	We expect our full-line stores to average approximately 1,800 square feet per store, and we expect to invest approximately $0.4 million per new store, consisting of inventory, pre-opening costs, and build-out costs, less tenant-improvement allowances.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P55_S1	We expect our factory outlet stores to average approximately 3,000 square feet per store, and we expect to invest approximately $0.4 million per new store, consisting of inventory, pre-opening costs, and build-out costs, less tenant-improvement allowances.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P55_S2	In 2006, we began selling our products through the verabradley.com website.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P55_S3	The objective of verabradley.com is to provide both a mechanism for marketing directly to consumers and a storefront where consumers can find the entire full-line Vera Bradley collection.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P55_S4	Since fiscal 2013, we have continually invested in upgrades to our website allowing for a more user-friendly homepage; enabling us to ship internationally; enhancing the checkout experience; adding product recommendations; enhancing product descriptions; adding silhouettes for product scale; generating cart and site abandonment emails; gathering and analyzing customer feedback; and enhancing our search capabilities.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P55_S5	To continue to enhance our website engagement, we completed a redesign and conversion of our website to a new platform in February 2017.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P55_S6	This new platform offers enhanced ease of shopping and incremental functionality including an upgraded mobile experience; additional navigation and search enhancements; improved product pages with enhanced imagery, product videos, and user-generated content; and new capabilities like the GiftNow feature, eGift cards, and order on-line, pick up in store.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P55_S7	In addition, during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we created an online outlet site to reduce clearance sales from verabradley.com.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P55_S8	We had over 46 million visits to verabradley.com and our online outlet site during fiscal 2018 .
1495320_18_ITEM1_P55_S9	Our annual outlet sale is held in the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum Exposition Center in Fort Wayne, Indiana each spring.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P55_S10	The annual outlet sale is an important tradition for Vera Bradley, has many loyal followers, and is an opportunity for us to sell our retired merchandise at discounted prices in a brand-right fashion.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P55_S11	We attracted approximately 46,000 attendees to our 2017 annual outlet sale.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P55_S12	As of February 3, 2018 , we sold our products in approximately 2,400 specialty retail locations, as well as department stores, national accounts, third party e-commerce sites, third-party inventory liquidators, and through licensing agreements.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	In fiscal 2012, we launched our products in the department store channel.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P56_S1	We are currently in approximately 660 department store locations, including approximately 260 Dillard's locations, approximately 240 Macy's, nearly 80 Bon-Ton, 45 Belk, and approximately 35 Von Maur locations.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P56_S2	The top 30% of our specialty retailers account for approximately 70% of total specialty retailer revenue.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P56_S3	No single Indirect retailer represented more than 10% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2018 , with the top ten Indirect retailers representing in the aggregate approximately 40% of total Indirect net revenues.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P56_S4	The majority of our Indirect retailers have been customers for over five years.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P56_S5	We believe that having a combination of an in-house field sales force and a third-party agency, covering certain geographies, results in a more consistent brand presentation and messaging, enhanced support for our Indirect customers, and a more predictable, scalable, and cost-efficient business model.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P56_S6	As of February 3, 2018 , our in-house sales team consisted of approximately 25 full-time sales consultants.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P56_S7	The compensation structure for our sales consultants consisted of a combination of fixed pay and sales-based incentives during fiscal 2018.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P56_S8	Beginning in fiscal 2019, the compensation structure will be based upon a full commission model.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	In addition to acquiring new and growing existing accounts, our sales consultants serve as a support center for our Indirect customers by assisting and educating them in areas such as merchandising and visual presentation, marketing the brand, product selection, and inventory management.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	Our visual merchandising program provides our sales consultants with a framework to guide our Indirect customers regarding optimal product placement and display that is intended to reinforce the message that our brand is distinct from those of our competitors.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	Manufacturing and Supply Chain Model Our multi-country manufacturing and supply chain model is designed to achieve efficient, timely, and accurate order fulfillment while maintaining appropriate levels of inventory.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	Our manufacturing and sourcing strategy is part of the larger cross-functional product development process.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P58_S2	The overall objective for our sourcing team is to build and sustain collaborative partnerships throughout our supply chain, with a focus on identifying appropriate countries and partners to manufacture our products.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P58_S3	The sourcing team leverages its expertise in negotiation, relationship management, and change management to maintain a strong global supply chain.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	We strive to maintain the appropriate balance of inventory to enable us to provide a high level of service to our customers, including prompt and accurate delivery of our products.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	We have an active and nimble sales and operations planning process that helps us balance the supply and demand issues that we encounter in our business, optimize our inventory levels, and anticipate inventory needs.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P59_S2	We have also integrated our planning, forecasting, and segmentation processes under one function called Merchandise Planning and Allocation.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	Approximately half of our products are cotton-based.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P60_S1	Our other fabrics include primarily nylon, polyester, microfiber, and leather.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P60_S2	We source our materials from various suppliers in Asia, with the majority coming from China and South Korea.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P60_S3	Our global sourcing team works with select suppliers enabling us to optimize the mix of cost, lead time, quality, and reliability within our global supply network.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P60_S4	All of our suppliers must comply with our quality standards, and we use only a limited number of pre-approved suppliers who have demonstrated a commitment to delivering the highest quality products.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P60_S5	In April 2016, we opened an office in Hong Kong to lead the global supply chain in Asia, including the oversight of sourcing and procurement.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	The majority of our finished goods, not sourced through licenses or strategic partners, are manufactured by a variety of global manufacturers located primarily in China, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Cambodia.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P61_S1	We are not dependent upon any single manufacturer for our products.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P61_S2	When determining the size of orders placed with our manufacturers, we take into account forward-looking demand, lead times for specific products, current inventory levels, and minimum order quantity requirements.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	Overseas production has resulted in substantial cost savings and a reduction of capital investment.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P62_S1	With the oversight of our office in Hong Kong and our independent contractors, we believe these financial benefits have been realized without sacrificing the level of quality inherent in our products or service to our customers.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	In 2007, we consolidated our warehousing and shipping functions into one distribution center, located in Roanoke, Indiana.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P63_S1	In fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2015, we expanded the facility by 200,000 and 10,000 square-feet, respectively, which resulted in a total distribution center space of approximately 428,500 square-feet.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P63_S2	This automated, computerized facility allows Vera Bradley employees to receive information directly from the order-collection center and quickly identify the products and quantities necessary for a particular order.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P63_S3	The expansion resulted in capacity gains in the areas of inbound receiving, inventory storage, order fulfillment, value-add processing, and shipping.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P63_S4	The facility s technology enables us to more accurately process and pack orders, as well as track shipments and inventory.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P63_S5	We believe that our systems for the processing and shipment of orders from our distribution center have enabled us to improve our overall customer service through enhanced order accuracy and reduced turnaround time.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P63_S6	Our products are shipped primarily via third-party common carriers to our stores, our Indirect retailers, department stores, and directly to our customers who purchase through our website.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P63_S7	We believe we are positioned well to support the order fulfillment requirements of our business, including business generated through our website.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P63_S8	We believe that high levels of automation and technology are essential to maintain our competitive position.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P63_S9	We maintain computer hardware, applications, and networks to enhance and accelerate the design process, to support the sale and distribution of our products to our customers, and to improve the integration and efficiency of our operations.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P63_S10	Our information systems are designed to provide, among other things, comprehensive order processing, production, accounting, and management information and analytics for the product development, retail, sales, marketing, distribution, finance, and human resources functions of our business.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P63_S11	We constantly evaluate and optimize the efficiency and cost of our on premise and cloud technology platforms to enable the business to provide an exceptional customer experience and increased shareholder value.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	Competition We face strong competition in each of the product lines and markets in which we compete.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	We believe that all of our products are in similar competitive positions with respect to the number of competitors they face and the level of competition within each product line.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P64_S2	Due to the number of different products we offer, it is not practicable for us to quantify the number of competitors we face.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P64_S3	Our products compete with other branded products within their product categories and with private label products sold by retailers.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P64_S4	In our Indirect business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers, and distributors of handbags, accessories, and other products for the limited space available for the display of such products to the consumer.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P64_S5	Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	In our Direct business, we compete against other independent retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, gift retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	The market for handbags, in particular, is highly competitive.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P66_S1	Our competitors include not only established companies that are expanding their production and marketing of handbags, but also frequent new entrants to the market.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P66_S2	We directly compete with wholesalers and direct sellers of branded handbags and accessories.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P66_S3	In varying degrees, depending on the product category involved, we compete on the basis of design (aesthetic appeal), quality (construction), function, price point, distribution, and brand positioning.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P66_S4	We believe that our primary competitive advantages are consumer recognition of our brand, customer loyalty, product development expertise, and our widespread presence through our multi-channel distribution model.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P66_S5	Some of our competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources than we do.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P66_S6	Further, we may face new competitors and increased competition from existing competitors as we expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	Copyrights and Trademarks The development of new patterns includes the design of primary and secondary prints.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P67_S1	Once developed, we generally copyright our patterns as appropriate.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P67_S2	We currently have approximately 900 copyrights.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P67_S3	We also own the material trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing, and distribution of all of our products, both in the United States and in the other countries in which our products are principally sold.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P67_S4	We aggressively police our trademarks and copyrights and pursue infringers and counterfeiters both domestically and internationally.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P67_S5	Our trademarks will remain in existence for as long as we continue to use and renew them in advance of their expiration dates.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	Employees As of February 3, 2018 , we had approximately 2,730 employees.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P68_S1	Of the total, approximately 2,140 were engaged in retail selling positions, approximately 290 were engaged in distribution, sourcing and quality functions, approximately 40 were engaged in product design, and approximately 260 were engaged in corporate support and administrative functions.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P68_S2	None of our employees are represented by a union.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P68_S3	We believe that our relations with our employees are good, and we have never encountered a significant work stoppage.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P68_S4	Many of our imported products are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs, or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the United States and other countries or impact the cost of such products.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P68_S5	To date, we have not been restricted by quotas in the operation of our business, and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of a majority of our products.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P68_S6	In addition, we are subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions, including U.S. retaliation against prohibited foreign practices, with respect to our product sourcing and international sales operations.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P68_S7	We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental matters, including the handling, transportation, and disposal of our products and our non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, and groundwater.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P68_S8	Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties, or the imposition of other liabilities.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect upon our earnings or financial position.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P69_S1	If we violate any laws or regulations, however, it could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	Robert Wallstrom has served as our Chief Executive Officer, President and Director since November 2013.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P70_S1	Prior to joining Vera Bradley, Mr. Wallstrom served as President of Saks Fifth Avenue s OFF 5TH division from 2007 until November 2013.
1495320_18_ITEM1_P70_S2	Previously, he was Group Senior Vice President and General Manager of Saks flagship New York store from 2002 to 2007, where he articulated a vision to return the store to its luxury heritage and dramatically improve merchandising, service, and the in-store experience.

1495320_18_ITEM1_P70_S4	Mr. Enwright was named Chief Financial Officer in April 2017.

1495320_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	If we are unable to successfully implement our long-term strategic plan, including Vision 20/20, and growth strategies, our future operating results could suffer.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	In fiscal 2018, we began to implement our Vision 20/20 plan, which is integrated into our long-term strategic plan, aimed to turnaround our business and restore brand and Company health over the next three years.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	The success of our long-term strategic plan and growth strategies, alone or collectively, will depend on various factors, including the appeal of our product designs, retail presentation to consumers, effectiveness of our marketing initiatives, expense saving initiatives, competitive conditions, and economic conditions.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our strategic plan and Vision 20/20 initiatives.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P0_S4	If we are unsuccessful in implementing some or all of our strategies or initiatives, our future operating results could be adversely impacted.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Changes in general economic conditions, and their impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Consumer confidence and consumer spending may be influenced by fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, changing fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, levels of unemployment and consumer debt levels, changes in net worth based on market conditions, general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment, and weather and weather-related phenomena.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty, and this could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	In the event that the U.S. economy worsens, or if there is a decline in consumer-spending levels or other unfavorable conditions, including inflation, we could experience lower than expected net revenues, which could force us to delay or slow the implementation of our growth strategies and adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our inability to predict and respond in a timely manner to changes in consumer demand could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Our success depends on our ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies consumer demand in a timely manner.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P1_S7	We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop appealing patterns and styles or meet changing consumer demands in the future.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P1_S8	If we misjudge the market for our products, we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P1_S9	In addition, changes to our product assortment and to our available fabrications, as well as the availability and breadth of pattern assortment may not gain consumer acceptance.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P1_S10	Merchandise misjudgments could adversely impact our net revenues and results of operations.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P1_S11	We may continue to experience declines in comparable sales and there can be no guarantee that the strategic initiatives we are implementing to improve our results will be successful.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P1_S12	We may not be able to regain the levels of comparable sales that we have experienced in the past, and comparable sales may also further deteriorate.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P1_S13	If our future comparable sales fail to meet market expectations, then the price of our common stock could decline.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P1_S14	Also, the aggregate results of operations of our stores have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P1_S15	Numerous factors influence comparable sales, including fashion trends, competition, national and regional economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, marketing programs, changes in consumer shopping trends, site selection strategy, and weather conditions.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P1_S16	These factors may cause our comparable sales results to be lower in the future than in recent periods or lower than expectations, either of which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	If our multi-channel distribution model is not successful, our business and results of operations may suffer.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	third-party inventory liquidators, and sales generated through licensing agreements.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	These channels are sometimes in direct competition and sales through these channels may not be incremental to total sales.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We may not be able to successfully open new stores and/or operate new and current stores as planned, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our long-term future growth includes our ability to successfully open and operate new and current stores.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In recent years, however, comparable store sales have declined.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Consequently, the rate in which we have opened new stores has slowed and we do not currently have any new full-line stores planned to be opened during fiscal 2019.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	As part of our Vision 20/20 initiatives, we are forecasting to close up to an additional 45 full-line stores by the end of fiscal 2021.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We have closed nine underperforming stores since December 2014.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P4_S5	We plan to open six new factory outlet stores during fiscal 2019 and will continue to evaluate our plans for store openings in future years in light of demand and store performance.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Our ability to successfully open and operate stores depends on many factors, including our ability to:
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	successfully integrate new stores into our existing operations and information technology systems.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The success of new store openings may also be affected by our ability to initiate marketing efforts in advance of opening our first store in a particular region.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Additionally, we will incur pre-opening costs and we may encounter initial losses while new stores commence operations, which could strain our resources and adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business depends on a strong brand.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If we are unable to execute our marketing strategy, intended to enhance our brand, then revenues and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We believe that the brand image that we have developed has contributed significantly to the success of our business.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We also believe that enhancing the Vera Bradley brand through our marketing strategy is critical to maintaining and expanding our customer base.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Enhancing our brand and implementing our marketing strategy may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as product design, store operations, store design, community relations, and marketing.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P6_S5	If we are unable to successfully execute our brand strategy, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Our results of operations could suffer if we lose key management or design associates or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Our performance depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and product development teams.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P6_S8	These executives and design associates have substantial experience in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P6_S9	Although we have entered into an employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, we may not be able to retain his services or those of other key individuals in the future.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P6_S10	The unexpected loss of services of key employees could have adverse impacts on our business and results of operations.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P6_S11	As our business grows and we open new stores, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees and develop, train, and manage an increasing number of management-level, sales, and other employees.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P6_S12	Competition for qualified employees is intense.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P6_S13	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain employees as needed in the future.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P6_S14	Our results of operations are subject to quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P6_S15	Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including, among other things:
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	timing of new pattern and collection releases and new product introductions.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Any quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	This could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	A data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, expose us to litigation risk and adversely affect our business.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	On September 15, 2016, we received information from law enforcement regarding a potential data security issue related to our retail store network.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Findings from the investigation showed unauthorized access to our payment processing system and the installation of a program that looked for payment card data.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The program was specifically designed to find track data in the magnetic stripe of a payment card that may contain the card number, cardholder name, expiration date, and internal verification code as the data was being routed through the affected payment systems.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Although we believe that we have resolved this incident, as more fully described within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein, we remain dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet, for a significant portion of our sales, primarily through our e-commerce operations and credit card transaction authorization and processing.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We are also responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our e-commerce websites and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As part of our normal course of business, we often collect, retain, and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information, over public networks.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	There is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Despite the security measures we currently have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Any electronic or physical security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, including penetration of our network security, whether by us or by a third party, could disrupt our business, severely damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, expose us to risks of litigation and liability and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We do not control third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will not occur in the future.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility, reduce our e-commerce net sales, impair our ability to attract website visitors, and reduce our ability to attract and retain customers.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P11_S5	We may also incur significant costs in complying with the various applicable state, federal, and foreign laws regarding unauthorized disclosure of personal information.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P11_S7	We are dependent on our computer systems to record and process transactions and manage and operate our business, including in designing, marketing, manufacturing, importing, tracking and distributing our products, processing payments, and accounting for and reporting results.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P11_S8	We also utilize an automated replenishment system to facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders, the movement of goods through distribution channels, and the collection of information for planning and forecasting.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P11_S9	In addition, we have an e-commerce website in the U.S. Given the complexity of our business and the significant number of transactions that we engage in on an annual basis, it is imperative that we maintain constant operation of our computer hardware and software systems.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P11_S10	Despite our preventive efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from, among other things, security breaches, computer viruses or power outages.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P11_S11	Any material disruptions in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We are exposed to business risks as a result of our e-commerce operations.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We operate an e-commerce store at www.verabradley.com, which includes an online outlet site we created in fiscal 2018.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Expanding our e-commerce business is one of the key objectives of our business strategy.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our e-commerce operations are subject to numerous risks, including unanticipated operating problems, reliance on third-party computer hardware and software providers, system failures and the need to invest in additional computer systems.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Specific risks include: (i) diversion of sales from our stores; (ii) rapid technological change; (iii) liability for e-commerce content; and (iv) risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate the websites and their related support systems, including from computer viruses, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	unauthorized access to our and/or customer information; (vi) credit card fraud; and (vii) competition and general economic conditions specific to the Internet, e-commerce, and the accessories industry.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our inability to effectively address these risks and any other risks that we face in connection with our Internet operations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Closing stores could result in significant costs to us.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Since December 2014, we have closed nine underperforming stores and are forecasting to close 45 additional full-line stores by the end of fiscal 2021, primarily as leases expire.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We could, in the future, decide to close additional stores that are producing losses or that are not as profitable as we expect.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P14_S5	If we decide to close any stores before the expiration of their lease terms, we may incur payments to landlords to terminate or buy out the remaining term of the lease.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P14_S6	We also may incur costs related to the employees at such stores, whether or not we terminate the leases early.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P14_S7	Upon any such closure, the closing costs, including fixed assets and inventory write-downs, could adversely affect our results and could adversely affect our cash on hand.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping centers in which many of our stores are located.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Substantially all of our Direct stores are located in regional mall shopping centers, and many of our Indirect customers are also located in these shopping centers.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Factors beyond our control impact mall traffic, such as general economic conditions and consumer spending levels.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Consumer spending and mall traffic have been depressed in recent years.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	As a result, mall operators have been facing increasing operational and financial difficulties.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The increasing inability of mall anchor tenants and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic around our stores, the increasing inability of mall operators to attract anchor tenants and maintain viable operations, and the increasing departures of existing anchor and other mall tenants due to declines in the sales volume and in the popularity of certain malls as shopping destinations, have reduced and may continue to reduce our sales volume and, consequently, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We lease all of our store locations.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We typically occupy our stores under operating leases with terms of ten years.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We have been able to negotiate favorable rental rates in recent years due in part to the state of the economy and high vacancy rates within some shopping centers, but there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to negotiate such favorable terms.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Some of our leases have early cancellation clauses, which permit the lease to be terminated by us or the landlord if certain sales levels are not met in specific periods or if the shopping center does not meet specified occupancy standards.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P17_S5	In addition to requiring future minimum lease payments, some of our store leases provide for the payment of common area maintenance charges, real property insurance, and real estate taxes.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Many of our lease agreements have escalating rent provisions over the initial term and any extensions.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P17_S7	If we expand our store base, our lease expense and our cash outlays for rent under lease agreements will increase.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including:
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	limiting our ability to obtain additional financing.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Any of these consequences could place us at a disadvantage with respect to our competitors.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We depend on cash flow from operating activities to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses and needs, we may not be able to service our lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would harm our business.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Additional sites that we lease may be subject to long-term non-cancelable leases if we are unable to negotiate our current standard lease terms.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, including paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Moreover, even if a lease has an early cancellation clause, we may not satisfy the contractual requirements for early cancellation under the lease.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Our inability to enter new leases or renew existing leases on acceptable terms or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that we close would, in any such case, affect us adversely.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our failure to effectively compete with other retailers for sales could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The market for bags, accessories, and travel items is increasingly competitive.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	establishing and maintaining good working relationships with our Indirect retailers.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In our Indirect business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers, and distributors of handbags, accessories, and other products for the limited space available for the display of such products to the consumer.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In our Direct business, we compete against other gift and specialty retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	In addition, in light of a continued difficult consumer environment, pricing is a significant driver of consumer choice in our industry and we regularly engage in price competition, particularly through our promotional programs.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P22_S5	To the extent that we decrease our promotional activity, our ability to maintain sales levels may be impacted.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P22_S6	We rely on various contract manufacturers to produce all of our products and generally do not have long-term contracts with our manufacturers.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our various contract manufacturers produce all of our products.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We generally do not enter into long-term formal written agreements with our manufacturers and instead transact business with each of them on an order-by-order basis.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In the event of a disruption in our contract manufacturers systems, we may be unable to locate alternative manufacturers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Identifying a suitable manufacturer is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with the prospective manufacturer s quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability, labor practices, and environmental compliance.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Any delay, interruption, or increased cost in the manufactured products that might occur for any reason, such as the lack of long-term contracts or regulatory requirements and the loss of certifications, power interruptions, fires, hurricanes, war, or threats of terrorism, could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products, adversely affect our net revenues, increase our cost of sales, and hurt our results of operations.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P23_S5	In addition, manufacturing disruption could injure our reputation and customer relationships, thereby harming our business.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We rely on various suppliers to supply a significant majority of our raw materials.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We generally do not enter into long-term formal written agreements with our suppliers and typically transact business with each of them on an order-by-order basis.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In the event of a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from our current sources, we may not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	In such a case, we could have difficulty meeting consumer demand and net revenues could be adversely impacted.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We rely on a single distribution facility for all of the products we sell.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Our distribution operations are currently concentrated in a single, company-owned distribution center in Roanoke, Indiana.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Any significant disruption in the operation of the facility due to natural disaster or severe weather, or events such as fire, accidents, power outages, system failures, or other unforeseen causes, could devalue or damage a significant portion of our inventory and could adversely affect our product distribution and sales until such time as we could secure an alternative facility.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	If we encounter difficulties with our distribution facility or other problems or disasters arise, we cannot ensure that critical systems and operations will be restored in a timely manner or at all, and this would have a material adverse effect on our business.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P25_S4	In addition, growth could require us to further expand our current facility, which could affect us adversely in ways that we cannot predict.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P25_S5	The cost of raw materials could increase our cost of sales and cause our results of operations to suffer.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Fluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of fabrics or other raw materials used to manufacture our products, as well as the price for labor, marketing, and transportation, could have adverse impacts on our cost of sales and our ability to meet our customers demands.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P25_S7	In particular, fluctuations in the price of cotton, our primary raw material, could have an adverse impact on our cost of sales.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P25_S8	In addition, because a key component of our products is petroleum-based, the cost of oil affects the cost of our products.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P25_S9	Upward movement in the price of oil in the global oil markets would also likely result in rising fuel and freight prices, which could increase our shipping costs.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P25_S10	In the future, we may not be able to pass all or a portion of higher costs on to our customers.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P25_S11	Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing and manufacturing activities.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P25_S12	We source our fabrics primarily from manufacturers in China and South Korea and outsource the production of a significant majority of our products to companies in Asia.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P25_S13	We are subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing and manufacturing, including, but not limited to:
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	quotas, duties, tariffs, or other trade restrictions or regulations.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Additionally, we do not have complete oversight over our contract manufacturers.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Violation of labor or other laws by those manufacturers, or the divergence of a contract manufacturer s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States or in other markets in which we may in the future do business, could also draw negative publicity for us and our brand, diminishing the value of our brand and reducing demand for our products.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our ability to source our products at favorable prices, or at all, could be harmed, with adverse effects on our results of operations, if new trade restrictions are imposed or if existing trade restrictions become more burdensome.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	A significant majority of our products are currently manufactured for us in Asia.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The United States and the countries in which our products are produced have imposed and may impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or regulations or may adversely adjust prevailing quotas, duties, or tariffs.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Countries impose, modify, and remove tariffs and other trade restrictions in response to a diverse array of factors, including global and national economic and political conditions, which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other trade restrictions.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Trade restrictions, which include embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us or could require us to modify our supply chain organization or other current business practices, any of which could harm our results of operations.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P29_S3	We may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns, or increased labor costs.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Currently, none of our employees are represented by a union.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Nevertheless, our employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to organize or affiliate with a union.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P29_S6	If some or all of our workforce were to become unionized, our business could be exposed to work stoppages and slowdowns as a unionized business.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P29_S7	In addition, if the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly more favorable to union workers than our current pay-and-benefits arrangements, our costs would increase and our results of operations would suffer.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P29_S8	We rely on independent transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We currently rely on independent transportation service providers for substantially all of our product shipments.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our utilization of these delivery services, or those of any other shipping companies that we may elect to use, is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, employee strikes and inclement weather, which may impact the shipping company s ability to provide delivery services sufficient to meet our shipping needs.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	If for any reason we were to change shipping companies, we could face logistical difficulties that might adversely affect deliveries, and we would incur costs and expend resources in the course of making the change.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Moreover, we might not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from the service providers that we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P30_S4	We also would face shipping and distribution risks and uncertainties associated with any expansion of our distribution facility and related systems.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Our inability or failure to protect our intellectual property or our infringement of other s intellectual property could have a negative impact on our operating results.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P30_S6	We believe that our registered copyrights, registered and common law trademarks, and other proprietary rights have significant value and are critical to our ability to create and sustain demand for our products.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P30_S7	Although we have not been inhibited from selling our products in connection with intellectual property disputes, we cannot assure you that obstacles will not arise as we expand our product line and extend our brand as well as the geographic scope of our sales and marketing.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P30_S8	We also cannot assure you that the actions taken by us to establish and protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products or infringement of our rights by others.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P30_S9	The legal regimes of some foreign countries, particularly China, may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by others in these countries.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P30_S10	The loss of copyrights, trademarks, and other proprietary rights could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P30_S11	Any litigation regarding our proprietary rights could be time consuming and costly.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P30_S12	We are also subject to the risk that claims will be brought against us for infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties, seeking to block the sale of our products considered to violate their intellectual property rights or payment of monetary amounts.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P30_S13	In particular, we are subject to copyright infringement claims for which we may not be entitled to indemnification from our suppliers.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P30_S14	In addition, in recent years, companies in the retail industry, including us, have been subject to patent infringement claims from non-practicing entities, or patent trolls.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P30_S15	Any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming and result in costly litigation.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P30_S16	As a result, any such claim, or the combination of multiple claims, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P30_S17	If we are required to stop using any of our registered or nonregistered trademarks, our sales could decline and, consequently, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P30_S18	Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results and stock price.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We are subject to income taxes in many U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which includes reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	bearing upon our revenues, income, property, or other aspects of our operations or business would, if enacted, affect our results of operations in ways and to a degree that we cannot currently predict.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ) was signed into law.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The Tax Act includes, among other things, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing for qualified property, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Section 15 of the Internal Revenue Code stipulates that our fiscal year ending February 3, 2018, has a blended federal statutory tax rate of approximately 32.9% , which is based on the applicable tax rates before and after the effectiveness of the Tax Act.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	The Company recorded $2.1 million in provisional income tax expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 based upon its understanding of the Tax Act and guidance as of the date of this filing.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	The ultimate impact of the Tax Act may differ from the provisional income tax expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P35_S3	The accounting for the Tax Act is expected to be complete when the fiscal 2018 federal income tax return is filed in fiscal 2019.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Any resulting changes to the provisional estimates and amounts not yet estimated will be recognized as an adjustment to tax expense in the reporting period that the amounts are determined.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P35_S5	These provisional amounts may differ due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions that the Company has made, additional regulatory guidance issued, and any additional actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Act.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P35_S6	Any of these items could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the Tax Act.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P35_S7	Further, there may be material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and liquidity resulting from the Tax Act that we have not yet identified.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P35_S8	We have recorded asset impairment charges in the past and we may record material asset impairment charges in the future.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Quarterly, we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If we determine that the carrying value of long-lived assets is not recoverable, we will be required to record impairment charges relating to those assets.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	For example, our assessments during fiscal 2018 indicated that operating losses or insufficient operating income existed at certain retail stores, with a projection that the operating losses or insufficient operating income for those locations would continue.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	As such, we recorded non-cash charges of $6.3 million during fiscal 2018 within selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations to write down the carrying values of these stores' long-lived assets to their estimated fair values.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Our quarterly evaluation of store assets includes consideration of current and historical performance and projections of future profitability.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P36_S5	The profitability projections rely upon estimates made by us, including store-level sales, gross margins, and direct expenses, and, by their nature, include judgments about how current strategic initiatives will impact future performance.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P36_S6	If we are not able to achieve the projected key financial metrics for any reason, including because any of the strategic initiatives being implemented do not result in significant improvements in our current financial performance trend, this would indicate that the value of our long-lived assets was not recoverable and we would incur additional impairment of assets in the future.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P36_S7	In the event we record additional impairment charges, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P36_S8	Our Indirect business could suffer as a result of decisions by our Indirect retailers to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P36_S9	We do not enter into long-term agreements with any of our Indirect retailers.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P36_S10	Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers for each of our lines every season.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P36_S11	A decision by a significant number of Indirect retailers, whether motivated by competitive conditions, operational or financial difficulties, reduced access to capital, or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or to change their manner of doing business with us could adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P36_S12	Although we recommend retail sale prices for our products to our Indirect retailers, we typically do not provide dealer allowances or other economic incentives to support those prices.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P36_S13	Possible promotional pricing or discounting by Indirect retailers in response to softening retail demand could have a negative effect on our brand image and prestige, which might be difficult to counteract.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P36_S14	Bankruptcies or other operational or financial difficulties of our Indirect retailers could adversely impact our business.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P36_S15	We sell our Indirect merchandise primarily to specialty retail and department stores across the United States and extend trade credit based on an evaluation of each Indirect retailer s financial condition, usually without requiring collateral.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P36_S16	Perceived or actual financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer or could decrease demand for our products by that customer.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	we might assume credit risk that we would otherwise avoid relating to our receivables from that customer.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Inability to collect on accounts receivable from our Indirect retailers would adversely impact our results of operations.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	There are claims made against us from time to time that can result in litigation or regulatory proceedings, which could distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability or damage to our brand image.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P37_S3	We increasingly face the risk of litigation and other claims against us.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Litigation and other claims may arise in the ordinary course of our business and include employee claims, custom and duty claims, commercial disputes, intellectual property issues, product-oriented allegations, and slip and fall claims.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P37_S5	Often these cases raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P37_S6	Litigation and other claims against us could result in unexpected expenses and liability, as well as materially adversely affect our operations and our reputation.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P37_S7	We may suffer negative publicity and our business may be harmed if we need to recall any products we sell.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P37_S8	We have in the past needed to, and may in the future need to, recall products that we determine may present safety issues.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P37_S9	If products we sell have safety problems of which we are not aware, or if we or the Consumer Product Safety Commission recall a product sold in our stores, we may suffer negative publicity and, potentially, product liability lawsuits, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations or cash flows.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P37_S10	Risks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock Our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell shares at or above the price at which you purchase them.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P37_S11	The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	These and other factors may result in a lower market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	In addition, the stock markets, including The NASDAQ Global Select Market, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many retail companies.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P38_S3	If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Over the last few years, proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies in retail businesses.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We could become engaged in a consent solicitation, or proxy contest, or experience other stockholder activism, in the future.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Activist shareholders may advocate for certain governance and strategic changes at our company.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	diverting the attention of management, and perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners, and customers.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	In addition, if faced with a consent solicitation or proxy contest, we may not be able to respond successfully to the contest or dispute, which would be disruptive to our business.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P42_S2	If individuals are elected to our Board with a differing agenda, our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders may be adversely affected.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P42_S3	A limited number of shareholders control a large percentage of the voting power of our common stock, and therefore investors may have limited ability to determine the outcome of shareholder votes.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Michael Ray (our former CEO and Ms. Bradley Baekgaard's son in-law), Robert Hall, Barbara Bradley Baekgaard, Joan Hall (Mr. Hall s wife and Ms. Bradley Baekgaard s daughter), Patricia R. Miller, and P. Michael Miller, directly or indirectly, beneficially own and have the ability to exercise voting control over, in the aggregate, 36.7% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of February 3, 2018 .
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P42_S5	As a result, these shareholders are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, any amendments to our second amended and restated articles of incorporation, and significant corporate transactions.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P42_S6	This concentrated ownership of outstanding common stock may limit your ability to influence corporate matters, and the interests of these shareholders may not coincide with our interests or your interests.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P42_S7	As a result, we may take actions that you do not believe to be in our interests or your interests and that could depress our stock price.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P42_S8	In addition, this significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock should investors perceive disadvantages in owning shares of common stock in a company that has such concentrated ownership.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P42_S9	Our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance, which could cause incongruous fluctuation in our stock price.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P42_S10	From time to time, we provide guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management s estimates as of the date of release.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P42_S11	This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in the release.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P42_S12	Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed, but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P43_S3	We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the further in the future that the data are forecast.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P44_S4	In light of the foregoing, if investors, analysts, and others fail to review our guidance within the proper context or place undue reliance on our guidance, deviations from such guidance may result in incongruous fluctuation in our stock price.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P44_S5	Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Indiana law may discourage or prevent a change in control, even if a sale of the Company would be beneficial to our shareholders, which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by shareholders to replace or remove our current management.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P44_S6	Our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control, discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock, harm the market price of our common stock, and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	requiring advance notice for raising business matters or nominating directors at shareholders meetings.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	As permitted by our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, our board of directors also has the ability, should they so determine, to adopt a shareholder rights agreement, sometimes called a poison pill, providing for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common stock.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	In the event of a takeover attempt, this preferred stock would give rights to holders of common stock (other than the potential acquirer) to buy additional shares of common stock at a discount, leading to the dilution of the potential acquirer s stake.
1495320_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The adoption of a poison pill, or the board s ability to do so, can have negative effects such as those described above.

1495320_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	How We Assess the Performance of Our Business In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Net Revenues Net revenues reflect revenues from the sale of our merchandise and from distribution and shipping and handling fees, less returns and discounts.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	Revenues for the Direct segment reflect sales through our full-line and factory outlet stores, verabradley.com, our online outlet site, direct-to-consumer eBay sales, and our annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	Revenues for the Indirect segment reflect sales to approximately 2,400 specialty retail partners, department stores, national accounts, third party e-commerce sites, third-party inventory liquidators, and sales generated through licensing agreements.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	Comparable Sales Comparable sales are calculated based upon our stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months and net revenues from our e-commerce operations.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P12_S4	Comparable store sales are calculated based solely upon our stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P12_S5	Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales and comparable store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period, in which case the non-comparable temporary closure periods are not included, or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales differently than we do.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	As a result, data in this report regarding our comparable sales and comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other companies.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Non-comparable sales include sales from stores not included in comparable sales or comparable store sales.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	The 53rd week in fiscal 2018 is excluded from comparable sales and comparable store sales.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	Measuring the change in year-over-year comparable sales allows us to evaluate how our store base and e-commerce operations are performing.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P14_S3	Various factors affect our comparable sales, including:
1495320_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Timing and success of promotional and advertising efforts.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	In recent years, comparable store sales have declined.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	Consequently, the rate in which we have opened new stores has slowed and we do not currently have any new full-line stores planned to be opened during fiscal 2019.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	As part of our Vision 20/20 initiatives, we are forecasting to close up to an additional 45 full-line stores by the end of fiscal 2021.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P16_S3	During fiscal 2018, we closed five underperforming full-line stores and one underperforming factory outlet store.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P16_S4	We plan to open six new factory outlet stores during fiscal 2019 and will continue to evaluate our plans for store openings in future years in light of demand and store performance.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Gross Profit Gross profit is equal to our net revenues less our cost of sales.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	Cost of sales includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise, distribution center costs, operations overhead, duty, and all inbound freight costs incurred.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	The components of our reported cost of sales may not be comparable to those of other retail and wholesale companies.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	Gross profit can be impacted by changes in volume; fluctuations in sales price; operational efficiencies, such as leveraging of fixed costs; promotional activities, such as free shipping; commodity prices, such as cotton prices; and labor costs.

1495320_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	Our Indirect retailers reimburse us for a portion of the cost to produce these materials.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	Reimbursement received is recorded as other income.

1495320_18_ITEM7_P19_S4	Other income also includes proceeds from the sales of tickets to our annual outlet sale.

1495320_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	(1) The Company utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	Fiscal year 2018 consisted of 53 weeks.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	Fiscal years 2017 and 2016 consisted of 52 weeks.

1495320_18_ITEM7_P23_S2	Decrease is reported as a percentage of the comparable sales for the same period in the prior fiscal year.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P23_S3	Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period, in which case the non-comparable temporary closure periods are not included, or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P23_S4	Calculation excludes sales for the 53 rd week in fiscal 2018.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Average net revenues per gross square foot are calculated by dividing total net revenues for our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the period by total gross square footage for those stores.

1495320_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	Calculation excludes sales for the 53 rd week in fiscal 2018.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	(6) Fiscal 2018 includes a $2.1 million net charge as a result of the Tax Act.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P24_S4	Refer to Note 5 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P24_S5	(7) Refer to Note 13 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement herein for restructuring and other charges affecting the comparability of results.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	On September 15, 2016, we received information from law enforcement regarding a potential data security issue related to our retail store network.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	Findings from the investigation showed unauthorized access to our payment processing system and the installation of a program that looked for payment card data.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	The program was specifically designed to find track data in the magnetic stripe of a payment card that may contain the card number, cardholder name, expiration date, and internal verification code as the data was being routed through the affected payment systems.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P25_S3	There is no indication that other customer information was at risk.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P25_S4	Payment cards used at Vera Bradley store locations between July 25, 2016 and September 23, 2016 may have been affected.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P25_S5	Not all cards used in stores during this time frame were affected.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P25_S6	Cards used on verabradley.com were not affected.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P25_S7	We have resolved this incident and continue to work with a computer security firm to further strengthen the security of our system to help prevent events of this nature from happening in the future.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P25_S8	We continue to support law enforcement s investigation and also promptly notified the payment card networks so that the banks that issue payment cards could initiate heightened monitoring on the affected cards.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P25_S9	Claims have been received by some, not all, of the payment card networks for this incident which is expected to be covered by our insurance, as described below.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P25_S10	During the fiscal years ended February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017 , we recorded an immaterial amount of expense relating to the Payment Card Incident.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P25_S11	Expenses included remediation activities during fiscal 2018 and costs to investigate the Payment Card Incident and obtain legal and other professional services during fiscal 2017.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P25_S12	There was no incremental expense associated with the claims received in fiscal 2018 as they are expected to be reimbursable and probable of recovery under our insurance coverage.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P25_S13	The insurance deductible was accrued during fiscal 2017.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Future Costs Additional payment card companies and associations may require us to reimburse them for unauthorized card charges and costs to replace cards and may also impose fines or penalties in connection with the Payment Card Incident, and enforcement authorities may also impose fines or other remedies against us.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss or range of loss related to the additional fines or penalties that may be assessed, if any.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	The Payment Card Incident, including customer response and any possible third party claims or the additional assessments from payment card companies, could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	However, we expect our insurance coverage will offset most of the expenses for the investigation and other legal and professional services associated with the incident, possible third party claims, as well as fines, penalties, or other expenses, if any additional, imposed by payment card companies, as discussed above.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P26_S4	We maintain $15.0 million of cyber security insurance coverage above a $0.1 million deductible.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Vision 20/20 Initiatives Fifty-Three Weeks Ended February 3, 2018 During fiscal 2018, we launched our Vision 20/20 strategic plan, which involves a more aggressive approach to turn around our business over the next three years.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	This plan is primarily focused on product and pricing initiatives, as well as selling, general, and administrative expense reduction initiatives.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	The product and pricing initiatives include restoring our full-price business by significantly reducing the amount of clearance merchandise offered on verabradley.com and in our full-line stores, streamlining current product offerings by eliminating unproductive or incongruent categories and SKUs from our assortment, and introducing tighter guardrails around new categories, patterns, and pricing.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P27_S3	We expect fiscal 2019 revenues will be negatively impacted by these initiatives by $30.0 million to $50.0 million from fiscal 2018 levels.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P27_S4	We continue to reduce selling, general, and administrative expenses by right-sizing the corporate infrastructure to better align with the size of the business, lowering our marketing spending by focusing on efficiencies while keeping our most loyal customers engaged, and taking a more aggressive stance on reducing store operating costs and closing underperforming full-line stores.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P27_S5	We expect to reduce annual selling, general, and administrative expenses by up to $30.0 million (off of our fiscal 2017 base level and excluding severance, store impairment, and Vision 20/20 charges from all periods).

1495320_18_ITEM7_P27_S7	We are forecasting to close up to 45 additional full-line stores by the end of fiscal 2021, primarily as leases expire.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P27_S8	The implementation of the plan began in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, but the majority of the product and pricing initiatives will not be completed until fiscal 2019.

1495320_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the property, plant, and equipment are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, as further defined in Note 2 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein.

1495320_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	This change resulted from approximately $3.0 million of net revenues generated from the 53rd week in fiscal 2018 and a $17.8 million contribution of revenue from our non-comparable stores, which included seven additional stores in the current year, more than offset by a comparable sales decrease of $23.1 million , or 6.7% .
1495320_18_ITEM7_P38_S4	The decrease in comparable sales includes a 9.3% decrease in e-commerce sales and a 5.5% decrease in comparable store sales.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P38_S5	The decline in comparable sales was primarily due to year-over-year declines in store and e-commerce traffic.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P38_S6	The aggregate number of full-line and factory outlet stores grew from 159 at the end of fiscal 2017 to 160 at the end of fiscal 2018 , which excludes six stores closed during fiscal 2018.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P38_S7	For fiscal 2018 , net revenues decreased $27.9 million , or 21.3% , to $102.9 million , from $130.8 million for fiscal 2017 , primarily due to a decline in orders from the Company's specialty retail accounts and certain key accounts along with a reduction in the number of specialty retail accounts.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P38_S8	This decline was partially offset by approximately $1.1 million of net revenues generated from the 53rd week in fiscal 2018.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P38_S9	Gross Profit For fiscal 2018 , gross profit decreased $22.0 million , or 8.0% , to $254.0 million , from $276.0 million for fiscal 2017 .
1495320_18_ITEM7_P38_S10	As a percentage of net revenues, gross profit decreased to 55.9% for fiscal 2018 , from 56.8% for fiscal 2017 .
1495320_18_ITEM7_P38_S11	The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to increased promotional activity in our factory outlet stores, inventory adjustments taken against certain product categories in the second and third quarters of the current year, and channel mix changes, partially offset by a reduction in product cost.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P38_S12	For fiscal 2018 , SG A expenses decreased $9.4 million , or 3.8% , to $239.8 million , from $249.2 million for fiscal 2017 .

1495320_18_ITEM7_P38_S16	The $4.8 million increase in SG A expenses for fiscal 2018 , as a result of the aforementioned charges, was more than offset by a $14.2 million decrease in SG A expenses for fiscal 2018 .
1495320_18_ITEM7_P38_S17	The decrease in SG A expenses was primarily due to a reduction in both employee-related expenses and advertising expenses, partially offset by new store expenses, including expenses associated with stores opened during fiscal 2018 and incremental expenses associated with the annualization of stores opened during fiscal 2017.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P38_S18	SG A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to SG A expense deleverage associated with lower sales, new store expenses, and the aggregate incremental impact of the fiscal 2018 Vision 20/20 charges and other charges, partially offset by the impact of the aforementioned incremental expense savings.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P38_S19	Other Income For fiscal 2018 , other income decreased $0.5 million , or 41.2% , to $0.8 million , from $1.3 million for fiscal 2017 , primarily due to a decrease in participation in the co-op mailer program.

1495320_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	The decrease in operating income as a percentage of Direct segment net revenues was primarily due to new store expenses, a decline in the gross profit as a percentage of net revenues as described above, and deleverage of SG A expenses due to lower sales, partially offset by lower store impairment charges and employee-related expenses as compared to the prior-year period.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P40_S3	For fiscal 2018 , operating income decreased $16.2 million , or 31.8% .

1495320_18_ITEM7_P40_S6	For fiscal 2018 , unallocated expenses decreased $4.6 million , or 5.3% .
1495320_18_ITEM7_P40_S7	The decrease in unallocated expenses was primarily due to a decrease in advertising spending and employee-related expenses principally as a result of expense management, which was associated in part with the implementation of Vision 20/20 initiatives during the third quarter.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P40_S8	These savings were partially offset by Vision 20/20 and other charges of $9.3 million in the current-year period which consisted of $4.6 million of strategic consulting charges, $4.6 million of employee severance charges, and $0.1 million of other Vision 20/20 charges.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P40_S9	The prior-year period included $0.9 million for an executive severance charge.

1495320_18_ITEM7_P40_S11	The year-over-year increase was primarily a result of interest earned on our investment portfolio which was implemented during fiscal 2018.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P40_S12	Refer to Note 14 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information regarding our investments.

1495320_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	The year-over-year increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the relative impact of $2.1 million of net charges associated with the Tax Act enacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 along with the relative impact of permanent and discrete items, including a tax shortfall from stock-based compensation.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	Refer to Note 5 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information regarding the Tax Act.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	The prior-year period included a $1.6 million income tax benefit for the release of certain income tax reserves.

1495320_18_ITEM7_P44_S2	This change resulted from a $28.0 million contribution of revenue from our non-comparable stores, which included ten additional stores in fiscal 2017, partially offset by a comparable sales decrease of $23.7 million, or 7.0%.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P44_S3	The decrease in comparable sales includes a 6.7% decrease in e-commerce sales and a 7.1% decrease in comparable store sales.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P44_S4	The decline in comparable sales was primarily due to year-over-year declines in store and e-commerce traffic, as well as lower levels of promotional activity in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.

1495320_18_ITEM7_P44_S9	The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to sourcing efficiencies (partly due to reduced overhead costs resulting from the closing of our domestic manufacturing facility), partially offset by increased promotional activity at our factory outlet stores.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P44_S10	In addition, gross profit in the first quarter of the comparable prior-year period was impacted by restructuring charges of $3.4 million related to the closure of our manufacturing facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, as discussed in more detail in Note 13 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P44_S11	For fiscal 2017, SG A expenses increased $12.4 million, or 5.2%, to $249.2 million, from $236.8 million for fiscal 2016.

1495320_18_ITEM7_P44_S14	In addition, the first quarter of the prior-year period included $1.2 million in expense related to a retail store early termination agreement which did not recur in fiscal 2017.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P44_S15	SG A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to the aforementioned items and fixed expenses being spread over lower comparable sales and deleveraging of store operating expenses as a result of lower comparable store sales.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P44_S16	Other Income For fiscal 2017, other income decreased $1.1 million, or 43.9%, to $1.3 million, from $2.4 million for fiscal 2016, primarily due to a decrease in participation in the co-op mailer program.

1495320_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	The decrease in operating income as a percentage of Direct segment net revenues was primarily due to $10.0 million in incremental store impairment charges, $7.1 million in new store expenses, and deleveraging of store operating expenses as a result of lower comparable store sales, partially offset by $3.5 million in restructuring and other charges related to the closure of our manufacturing facility and a retail store early termination agreement in the comparable prior-year period, as well as an increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, as described above.

1495320_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	We believe that cash on hand and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities, investments, and the availability of borrowings under our second amended and restated credit agreement or other financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures, as well as share repurchases and debt payments, if any, for the foreseeable future.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	Investments classified as cash equivalents relate to highly-liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	As of February 3, 2018, these investments in our portfolio consisted of commercial paper, a money market fund, and municipal securities.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	As of February 3, 2018, short-term investments consisted of a certificate of deposit, municipal securities, U.S. and non-U.S. corporate debt securities, and commercial paper with a maturity within one year of the balance sheet date.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	As of January 28, 2017, short-term investments consisted of a certificate of deposit with an original maturity of one year and a one-time option to accelerate maturity to 31 days without penalty.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	The certificate of deposit from fiscal 2017 matured during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P51_S3	As of February 3, 2018, long-term investments consisted of municipal securities, U.S. and non-U.S. corporate debt securities, and U.S. treasury securities with a maturity greater than one year from the balance sheet date.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P51_S4	Refer to Note 14 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information regarding our investments.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P51_S5	Cash Flow Analysis A summary of operating, investing, and financing activities is shown in the following table (in thousands):
1495320_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation, the effect of changes in assets and liabilities, and tenant-improvement allowances received from landlords under our store leases.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities was $42.6 million during fiscal 2018 , as compared to $65.2 million during fiscal 2017 .
1495320_18_ITEM7_P52_S2	The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of a decrease in net income of $12.8 million and a change in accounts payable which resulted in a use of cash of $18.2 million as compared to a source of cash of $9.0 million in the comparable prior-year period primarily as a result of a reduction in certain inventory categories along with timing of payments.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P52_S3	These factors were partially offset by a change in income taxes which resulted in a use of cash of $0.9 million as compared to a use of cash of $12.0 million in the comparable prior-year period and a change in inventories that resulted in a source of cash of $14.4 million as compared to a source of cash of $11.3 million in the comparable prior-year period.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P52_S4	The inventory change was primarily due to a reduction in certain inventory categories.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P52_S5	The income tax change was primarily a result of the timing of an $11.5 million federal income tax payment in the prior-year period.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P52_S6	Net income included cash payments of approximately $7.6 million as a result of Vision 20/20 initiatives in the current-year period.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P52_S7	Refer to Note 13 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities was $65.2 million during fiscal 2017, as compared to $43.3 million during fiscal 2016.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of the timing of inventory receipts in fiscal 2017, which resulted in a source of cash for fiscal 2017 of $11.3 million, as compared to an inventory build in the comparable prior-year period for made-for-outlet product, which resulted in a use of cash of $15.2 million in the comparable prior-year period.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P53_S2	In addition, accounts payable resulted in a source of cash for fiscal 2017 of $9.0 million, as compared to a use of cash of $8.7 million in the comparable prior-year period, primarily due to the timing of inventory payments.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P53_S3	These sources of cash were partially offset by a change in income taxes which resulted in a use of cash of $12.0 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to a source of cash of $12.5 million in the comparable prior-year period.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	timing of an $11.5 million federal income tax payment in fiscal 2017, as well as incremental payments as a result of increased income at certain points in time during fiscal 2017.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Investing activities consist primarily of short-term investments, long-term investments, and capital expenditures for growth related to new store openings, buildings, operational equipment, and information technology investments.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	Net cash used in investing activities was $51.6 million in fiscal 2018 , compared to $50.8 million in fiscal 2017 .
1495320_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	There was a decrease of $9.0 million in spending for property, plant, and equipment in the current-year period primarily due to a $4.2 million reduction in information technology investment spending and the construction of seven retail stores and 20 store remodels in the current-year period as compared to the construction of ten retail stores and 14 store remodels in the comparable prior-year period.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P55_S3	In addition, there was a net use of cash of $39.8 million as a result of investment activity in the current-year period compared to a use of cash of $30.0 million in the comparable prior-year period.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P55_S4	Net cash used in investing activities was $50.8 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $26.3 million in fiscal 2016.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P55_S5	The increase in cash used in investing activities was due to a $30.0 million short-term investment in a certificate of deposit made in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, partially offset by a decrease in property, plant, and equipment spending compared to the prior-year period.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P55_S6	The decrease in property, plant, and equipment spending was primarily a result of ten new stores opened in fiscal 2017 as compared to 26 stores in the comparable prior-year period, as well as spending for the campus consolidation in the prior-year period which did not recur in fiscal 2017, partially offset by an increase in information technology investments, including spending for our e-commerce platform upgrade.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P55_S7	Capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 are expected to be approximately $10.0 million .
1495320_18_ITEM7_P55_S8	Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $8.6 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $25.7 million in fiscal 2017 .
1495320_18_ITEM7_P55_S9	The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to $7.9 million of cash purchases of our common stock under the 2015 Share Repurchase Plan in the current-year period compared to $25.0 million of cash purchases of our common stock under the 2015 Share Repurchase Plan in the prior-year period.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P55_S10	Net cash used in financing activities was $25.7 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $31.5 million in fiscal 2016.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P55_S11	The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to $25.0 million of cash purchases of our common stock under the 2015 Share Repurchase Plan in fiscal 2017 compared to $30.9 million of cash purchases of our common stock under the 2015 and 2014 Share Repurchase Plans in the prior-year period.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On July 15, 2015, Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. ( VBD ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement among VBD, the lenders from time to time party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as syndication agent, and KeyBank National Association, as documentation agent (the Credit Agreement ), which amended and restated our prior credit agreement.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	The Credit Agreement provides for certain credit facilities to VBD in an aggregate principal amount not to initially exceed $125.0 million, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes of VBD and its subsidiaries, including but not limited to Vera Bradley International, LLC and Vera Bradley Sales, LLC (collectively, the Named Subsidiaries ).
1495320_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	Amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at VBD's option, at a per annum rate equal to either (A) the Alternate Base Rate ( ABR ) plus the Applicable Margin, where the ABR is the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and (iii) Adjusted LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1%, and the Applicable Margin is a percentage ranging from 0.00% to 0.70% depending upon the Company's leverage ratio or (B) Adjusted LIBOR plus the Applicable Margin, where Adjusted LIBOR means LIBOR, as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities, and Applicable Margin is a percentage ranging from 1.00% to 1.70% depending upon the Company's leverage ratio.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	Any loans made, or letters of credit issued, pursuant to the Credit Agreement mature on July 15, 2020.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	As of February 3, 2018 , the Company had no borrowings and availability of $125.0 million under the agreement.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P57_S2	VBD's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and the Named Subsidiaries.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P57_S3	The obligations of VBD under the Credit Agreement are secured by first priority security interests in all of the respective assets of VBD, the Company, and the Named Subsidiaries and a pledge of the equity interests of VBD and the Named Subsidiaries.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	stock, enter into related party transactions and make capital expenditures, other than upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	The Company is also required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum ratio of EBITDAR to the sum of interest expense plus rentals (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and a limit on capital expenditures.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P58_S2	Upon an event of default, which includes certain customary events such as, among other things, a failure to make required payments when due, a failure to comply with covenants, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, a material adverse change (as defined in the Credit Agreement), defaults under other material indebtedness, and a change in control, the lenders may accelerate amounts outstanding, terminate the agreement and foreclose on all collateral.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	On October 20, 2017, VBD entered into Amendment No. 2 (the Amendment ) to the Credit Agreement.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	The Amendment modifies the ratio requirements of certain financial covenants in the Credit Agreement including the maximum leverage ratio and the minimum ratio of EBITDAR to the sum of interest expense plus rentals (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
1495320_18_ITEM7_P59_S2	The Amendment also modifies certain restrictive covenants including the acquisition of investments and the limit of investments in foreign subsidiaries.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P59_S3	The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of February 3, 2018 .
1495320_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	We enter into long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily non-cancellable operating leases.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	As of February 3, 2018 , our contractual cash obligations over the next several periods are as follows:
1495320_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	(1) Our store leases are generally ten years with varying renewal options.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	Our future operating lease obligations would change if we were to extend these leases, terminate these leases early or if we were to enter into new operating leases.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	As part of our Vision 20/20 initiatives, we are forecasting to close up to an additional 45 full-line stores by fiscal 2021.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P61_S3	These potential closures are not reflected in the table until an agreement with the landlord has been reached.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	(2) Purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	(3) The Company has elected to pay the U.S. federal tax on deemed mandatory repatriation, associated with the Tax Act, when its fiscal 2018 federal income tax return is filed in fiscal 2019.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	(4) Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our uncertain tax positions at February 3, 2018 , we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P62_S3	Therefore, $0.1 million of uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosures relating to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	We evaluate our accounting policies, estimates, and judgments on an on-going basis.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P64_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P64_S4	We evaluate the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and believe that the following policies and estimates involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position, and are therefore discussed as critical.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	The following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent results of operations.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	consolidated financial statements, however, have not been materially impacted by such variances.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	More information on all of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from the sale of our products is recognized upon customer receipt of the product when collection of the associated receivables is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and ownership and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, which, for e-commerce and most Indirect sales, reflects an estimate of shipments that customers have not yet received.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	The adjustment of these shipments is based on actual delivery dates to the customer.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P68_S2	Significant changes in shipping terms or delivery times could materially impact our revenues in a given period.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	We reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	In the Direct business, returns are refunded by issuing the same payment tender of the original purchase and in the Indirect business the customer is issued a credit to its account to apply to outstanding invoices.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	Merchandise exchanges of the same product at the same price are not considered merchandise returns.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	Product returns are often resalable through our annual outlet sale or other channels.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P70_S2	Additionally, we reserve for customer allowances for certain Indirect retailers based upon various contract terms and other potential product credits granted to Indirect retailers.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P70_S3	The balance of the reserve for returns, customer shipments not yet received, and retailer credits was $3.3 million and $6.2 million as of February 3, 2018 , and January 28, 2017 , respectively.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	We sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers and do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P71_S1	Gift cards that we issue are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed, at which point revenue is recognized.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P71_S2	In addition, we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	We determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	During each of the fiscal years ended February 3, 2018 , January 28, 2017 , and January 30, 2016 , the Company recorded $0.3 million of revenue related to gift card breakage.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excess quantities, and other factors, including the popularity of a pattern or product, in evaluating net realizable value.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	We record valuation adjustments to our inventories, which are reflected in cost of sales, if the cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	This adjustment calculation requires us to make assumptions and estimates, which are based on factors such as merchandise seasonality, historical trends, and estimated sales and inventory levels, including sell-through of remaining units.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P75_S2	In addition, as part of inventory adjustments, we provide for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from our physical inventory counts.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P75_S3	We perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrinkage provision accordingly.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P75_S4	The balance of inventory adjustments was $2.7 million and $2.6 million for these matters as of the fiscal years ended February 3, 2018 , and January 28, 2017 , respectively.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P75_S5	The balance related primarily to certain collections being discontinued or currently discontinued by the Company and retired patterns.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P75_S6	Inventory adjustments during fiscal 2018 primarily related to product categories being discontinued, partially offset by the sell-through of certain reserved inventory categories.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P75_S7	We have the ability to move retired finished goods through a number of channels, including the annual outlet sale, our website and online outlet site, factory outlet stores, and through third-party liquidators as needed.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is based on our pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P76_S2	We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained; (2) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	Taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	We believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P77_S2	Taxing authorities, however, may take a contrary position.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P77_S3	Our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if, upon final resolution with taxing authorities, we prevail in positions for which we have established reserves, or are required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	The balance of the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) was $0.1 million , $0.9 million , and $3.1 million as of February 3, 2018 , January 28, 2017 , and January 30, 2016 , respectively.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	A benefit of $0.5 million , a benefit of $1.9 million , and an expense of $0.1 million was recognized in income tax expense for these matters during the fiscal years ended February 3, 2018 , January 28, 2017 , and January 30, 2016 , respectively.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ) was signed into law.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	The Tax Act includes, among other things, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing for qualified property, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide system to a territorial system with a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI ), and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, we recorded $2.1 million in provisional income tax expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 based upon our understanding of the Tax Act and guidance as of the date of this filing.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	Any resulting changes to the provisional estimates and amounts not yet estimated will be recognized as an adjustment to tax expense in the reporting period that the amounts are determined.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P80_S2	Refer to Note 5 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information regarding the Tax Act.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	Valuation of Long-lived Assets Property, plant, and equipment assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	In evaluating an asset for recoverability, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset at the store level, the lowest identifiable level of cash flow, if applicable.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset is less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, usually determined by an estimated discounted cash flow analysis of the asset.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	Factors used in the valuation of long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, our plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results, and projected future cash flows.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	With respect to our stores, we analyze store economics, location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies in our selection process.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	Impairment charges are classified in SG A expenses and were $6.3 million , $12.7 million , and $2.8 million for the periods ended February 3, 2018 , January 28, 2017 , and January 30, 2016 , respectively.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	The discounted cash flow models used to estimate the applicable fair values involve numerous estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P86_S1	Changes to these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the fair value estimates.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P86_S2	The estimates and assumptions critical to the overall fair value estimates include: (1) estimated future cash flow generated at the store level; and (2) discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair values.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P86_S3	These and other estimates and assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and our expectations and may change in the future based on period-specific facts and circumstances.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P86_S4	If economic conditions were to deteriorate, future impairment charges may be required.
1495320_18_ITEM7_P86_S5	Transactions with Related Parties See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, of this report for information regarding transactions with related parties.
1495320_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our second amended and restated credit agreement, which bear interest at variable rates.
1495320_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The second amended and restated credit agreement allows for a revolving credit commitment of $125.0 million, bearing interest at a variable rate, based on (A) the ABR plus the Applicable Margin, where the ABR is the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and (iii) Adjusted LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1%, and the Applicable Margin is a percentage ranging from 0.00% to 0.70% depending upon the Company's leverage ratio or (B) Adjusted LIBOR plus the Applicable Margin, where Adjusted LIBOR means LIBOR, as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities, and Applicable Margin is a percentage ranging from 1.00% to 1.70% depending upon the Company's leverage ratio.
1495320_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Assuming borrowings available under the second amended and restated credit agreement are fully extended, each quarter point increase or decrease in the interest rate would change our annual interest expense by approximately $0.3 million.
1495320_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Impact of Inflation Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost.
1495320_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Although it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial.

1495320_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P49_S1	This guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P49_S2	The new standard also will result in enhanced disclosures about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P49_S3	The standard allows for either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective transition method.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P49_S4	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, which for the Company is February 4, 2018 (the beginning of the Company's fiscal 2019).
1495320_18_ITEM8_P49_S5	Earlier application is permitted as of the original effective date, annual reporting periods beginning after December 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P49_S6	The Company has completed its assessment regarding the impact of the adoption of the standard on its consolidated financial statements and determined that the standard will impact the Company's adjustments to revenue for shipments not yet received, recognition of revenue for unredeemed gift cards, and recognition of licensing revenue.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	The Company will no longer adjust revenue for shipments not yet received at each reporting period as it will recognize revenue as control is passed to the customer.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	It was determined that control is passed to the customer upon shipment, consistent with when legal title is passed.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P50_S2	This will accelerate the recognition of revenue at each reporting period compared to the Company's historical practice.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P50_S3	Revenue for unredeemed gift cards will be estimated and recognized based on the historical patterns of gift card redemption.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	Historically, the Company recognized revenue for gift card breakage when the likelihood of the customer exercising their remaining rights became remote.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	This will accelerate the recognition of gift card breakage revenue at each reporting period compared to the Company's historical practice.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P51_S2	Revenue associated with contractually guaranteed minimum royalties in sales-based royalty arrangements will be recognized straight-line over the remaining license period once determined that the minimum sales level will not be achieved.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P51_S3	Historically, the Company recognized any excess of the guaranteed minimum royalty over the actual royalties earned at the end of the license period.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P51_S4	The Company will adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective method with a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P51_S5	The Company expects this cumulative adjustment and the future impact to the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Income to be immaterial.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which increases transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P52_S1	This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P52_S2	The Company has operating leases at all of its retail stores; therefore, the adoption of this standard will result in a material increase of assets and liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

1495320_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the property, plant, and equipment are less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, as further defined in Note 2.

1495320_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	Section 15 of the Internal Revenue Code stipulates that the Company's fiscal year ended February 3, 2018, has a blended federal statutory tax rate of approximately 32.9% , which is based on the applicable tax rates before and after the effectiveness of the Tax Act and the number of days in the year.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Company recorded $2.1 million in provisional income tax expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 based upon its understanding of the Tax Act and guidance as of the date of this filing.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P68_S1	Of the $2.1 million , $2.0 million was related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets at rates which they are expected to reverse in the future and $0.3 million was related to the one-time transition tax on mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, which were partially offset by a $0.2 million income tax benefit related to the blended federal statutory rate.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Tax Act established a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income and the Company is currently analyzing the provision and as a result cannot reasonably estimate an impact.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	The ultimate impact of the Tax Act may differ from the provisional income tax expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	These provisional amounts may differ due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions that the Company has made, additional regulatory guidance issued, and any additional actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Act.

1495320_18_ITEM8_P70_S4	Consistent with this guidance, any resulting changes to the provisional estimates and amounts not yet estimated will be recognized as an adjustment to tax expense in the reporting period that the amounts are determined.
1495320_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities.

1495320_18_ITEM8_P72_S2	The final impact may differ from the Company's reasonable estimate due to, among other things, additional analyses, changes in interpretations and assumptions that were made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions that the Company may take as a result of the Tax Act.

1495320_18_ITEM8_P85_S15	The Payment Card Incident, including customer response and any possible third party claims or additional assessments from payment card companies, could materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results.
