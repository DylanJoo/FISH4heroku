837465_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	The Company became a publicly traded corporation in 1992, and in 1997, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Odyssey Sports, Inc., which manufactured and marketed the Odyssey brand of putters and wedges.
837465_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	The Company reincorporated in Delaware on July 1, 1999 and in 2000, the Company entered the golf ball business with the release of its first golf ball product.
837465_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	In 2003, the Company acquired through a court-approved sale substantially all of the golf-related assets of the TFGC Estate Inc. (f/k/a The Top-Flite Golf Company, f/k/a Spalding Sports Worldwide, Inc.), which included golf ball manufacturing facilities, the Top-Flite and Ben Hogan brands, and all golf-related patents and trademarks (the Top-Flite Acquisition ).
837465_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	In 2008, the Company acquired certain assets and liabilities of uPlay, LLC, a developer and marketer of global positioning system ( GPS ) range finders.
837465_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	Today, the Company, together with its subsidiaries, designs, manufactures and sells high quality golf clubs (drivers, fairway woods, hybrids, irons, wedges and putters) and golf balls, and also sells golf accessories (such as GPS range finders, golf bags, gloves, footwear, apparel, headwear, eyewear, towels and umbrellas) under the Callaway Golf, Odyssey, Top-Flite, Ben Hogan, and uPro brand names.
837465_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Company generally sells its products to retailers, directly and through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and to third-party distributors.
837465_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	The Company sells pre-owned golf products through its website, www.callawaygolfpreowned.com.
837465_11_ITEM1_P3_S2	In addition, the Company has an online store where consumers can place an order for Callaway Golf, Top-Flite, Ben Hogan and Odyssey products through its website Shop.CallawayGolf.com.
837465_11_ITEM1_P3_S3	The Company also licenses its trademarks and service marks in exchange for a royalty fee to third parties for use on golf and lifestyle products, including apparel, rangefinders, practice aids and travel gear.
837465_11_ITEM1_P3_S4	The Company s products are sold in the United States and in over 100 countries around the world.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Certain Factors Affecting Callaway Golf Company The Company s business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We urge you to carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those risks set forth under the heading entitled Important Notice to Investors, and in other documents that the Company files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, before making any investment decision with respect to the Company s securities.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop, the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Under these circumstances, the trading prices of the Company s securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in the Company s securities.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P0_S4	U nfavorable economic conditions could have a negative impact on consumer discretionary spending and therefore reduce sales of the Company s products.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The Company sells golf clubs, golf balls and golf accessories.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These products are recreational in nature and are therefore discretionary purchases for consumers.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Discretionary spending is also affected by many other factors, including general business conditions, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxes, and consumer confidence in future economic conditions.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Purchases of the Company s products could decline during periods when disposable income is lower, or during periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	A significant or prolonged decline in general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that adversely affect consumer discretionary spending, whether in the United States or in the Company s international markets, could result in reduced sales of the Company s products, which could have a negative impact on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	A severe or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our customers financial condition, their levels of business activity and their ability to pay trade obligations.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The Company primarily sells its products to golf equipment retailers directly and through wholly-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries, and to foreign distributors.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally requires no collateral from these customers.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Historically, the Company s bad debt expense has been low.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	However, a prolonged downturn in the general economy could adversely affect the retail golf equipment market which in turn, would negatively impact the liquidity and cash flows of our customers, including the ability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and to pay their trade obligations.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P3_S4	This could result in increased delinquent or uncollectible accounts for some of the Company s significant customers.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P3_S5	A failure by the Company s customers to pay on a timely basis a significant portion of outstanding account receivable balances would adversely impact the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P3_S6	The Company has significant international sales and purchases, and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the Company s results of operations.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	A significant portion of the Company s purchases and sales are international purchases and sales, and the Company conducts transactions in approximately 14 currencies worldwide.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Conducting business in such various currencies exposes the Company to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The Company s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	As a result, transactions conducted in foreign currencies must be translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes based upon the applicable foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Fluctuations in these foreign currency exchange rates therefore may positively or negatively affect the Company s reported financial results and can significantly affect period-over-period comparisons.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The effect of the translation of foreign currencies on the Company s financial results can be significant.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The Company therefore from time to time engages in certain hedging activities to mitigate over time the impact of the translation of foreign currencies on the Company s financial results.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The Company s hedging activities can reduce, but will not eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	The extent to which the Company s hedging activities mitigate the effects of foreign currency translation varies based upon many factors, including the amount of transactions being hedged.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P5_S4	The Company generally only hedges a limited portion of its international transactions.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Other factors that could affect the effectiveness of the Company s hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts, volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Since the hedging activities are designed to reduce volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar but also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Company s future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts business.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Foreign currency fluctuations can also affect the prices at which products are sold in the Company s international markets.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The Company therefore adjusts its pricing based in part upon fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Significant unanticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates make it more difficult for the Company to manage pricing in its international markets.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	pricing in a timely manner to counteract the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, the Company s pricing may not be competitive in the marketplace and the Company s financial results in its international markets could be adversely affected.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The Company s obligations and certain financial covenants contained under the existing Line of Credit expose it to risks that could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Company s primary credit facility is comprised of a $250.0 million Line of Credit with a syndicate of eight banks under the terms of the November 5, 2004, Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as subsequently amended, the Line of Credit ).
837465_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The Line of Credit expires on February 15, 2012 and provides for revolving loans of up to $250.0 million, although actual borrowing availability can be effectively limited by the financial covenants contained therein, including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Both the maximum consolidated leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio are based in part upon the Company s trailing four quarters earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, as well as other non-cash expense and income items as defined in the agreement governing the Line of Credit ( adjusted EBITDA ).
837465_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	If the Company experiences a decline in revenues or adjusted EBITDA, the Company may have difficulty paying interest and principal amounts due on our Line of Credit or other indebtedness and meeting certain of the financial covenants contained in the Line of Credit.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If the Company is unable to make required payments under the Line of Credit, or if the Company fails to comply with the various covenants and other requirements of the Line of Credit or other indebtedness, the Company would be in default thereunder, which would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate the maturity thereof and increase the interest rate thereon.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Any default under the Line of Credit or other indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s liquidity, business, operating results and financial condition and ability to make any dividend or other payments on the Company s capital stock.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The Company relies on its Line of Credit to provide additional liquidity and if the Company could not replace its Line of Credit upon expiration, the Company s liquidity would be significantly adversely affected.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P9_S4	The Company s Line of Credit expires on February 15, 2012.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P9_S5	The Company expects to be able to replace its Line of Credit on or before its expiration.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P9_S6	If due to the economic environment, the Company s performance or financial condition, or other factors the Company is unable to obtain replacement financing at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, the Company s liquidity would be significantly adversely affected and the Company s business, operating results, financial condition and ability to make any dividend or other payments on the Company s capital stock, would be significantly adversely affected.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P9_S7	If the Company is unable to successfully manage the frequent introduction of new products that satisfy changing consumer preferences, it could adversely impact its financial performance and prospects for future growth.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Company s main products, like those of its competitors, generally have life cycles of two years or less, with sales occurring at a much higher rate in the first year than in the second.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Factors driving these short product life cycles include the rapid introduction of competitive products and quickly changing consumer preferences.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In this marketplace, a substantial portion of the Company s annual revenues is generated each year by products that are in their first year of life.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	These marketplace conditions raise a number of issues that the Company must successfully manage.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	For example, the Company must properly anticipate consumer preferences and design products that meet those preferences while also complying with significant restrictions imposed by the Rules of Golf (see further discussion of the Rules of Golf below) or its new products will not achieve sufficient market success to compensate for the usual decline in sales experienced by products already in the market.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	perform better than their predecessors many of which incorporate new or otherwise untested technology, suppliers or inputs.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Third, for new products to generate equivalent or greater revenues than their predecessors, they must either maintain the same or higher sales levels with the same or higher pricing, or exceed the performance of their predecessors in one or both of those areas.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Fourth, the relatively short window of opportunity for launching and selling new products requires great precision in forecasting demand and assuring that supplies are ready and delivered during the critical selling periods.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Finally, the rapid changeover in products creates a need to monitor and manage the closeout of older products both at retail and in the Company s own inventory.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Should the Company not successfully manage all of the risks associated with this rapidly moving marketplace, the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be significantly adversely affected.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P12_S5	A reduction in the number of rounds of golf played or in the number of golf participants could adversely affect the Company s sales.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The Company generates substantially all of its revenues from the sale of golf-related products, including golf clubs, golf balls and golf accessories.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The demand for golf-related products in general, and golf balls in particular, is directly related to the number of golf participants and the number of rounds of golf being played by these participants.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If golf participation or the number of rounds of golf played decreases, sales of the Company s products may be adversely affected.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	In the future, the overall dollar volume of the market for golf-related products may not grow or may decline.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P13_S4	In addition, the demand for golf products is also directly related to the popularity of magazines, cable channels and other media dedicated to golf, television coverage of golf tournaments and attendance at golf events.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P13_S5	The Company depends on the exposure of its products through advertising and the media or at golf tournaments and events.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Any significant reduction in television coverage of, or attendance at, golf tournaments and events or any significant reduction in the popularity of golf magazines or golf channels, could reduce the visibility of the Company s brand and could adversely affect the Company s sales.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P13_S7	The Company may have limited opportunities for future growth in sales of golf clubs and golf balls.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P13_S8	In order for the Company to significantly grow its sales of golf clubs or golf balls, the Company must either increase its share of the market for golf clubs or balls, or the market for golf clubs or balls must grow.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P13_S9	The Company already has a significant share of worldwide sales of golf clubs and golf balls.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P13_S10	Therefore, opportunities for additional market share may be limited.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P13_S11	The Company also believes that overall dollar volume of the worldwide market for golf equipment sales has declined over the past two years.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P13_S12	In the future, the overall dollar volume of worldwide sales of golf clubs or golf balls may not grow or may continue to decline.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If the Company inaccurately forecasts demand for its products, it may manufacture either insufficient or excess quantities, which, in either case, could adversely affect its financial performance.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The Company plans its manufacturing capacity based upon the forecasted demand for its products.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The nature of the Company s business makes it difficult to quickly adjust its manufacturing capacity if actual demand for its products exceeds or is less than forecasted demand.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If actual demand for its products exceeds the forecasted demand, the Company may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of new products in time to fulfill actual demand, which could limit the Company s sales and adversely affect its financial performance.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P14_S4	On the other hand, if actual demand is less than the forecasted demand for its products, the Company could produce excess quantities, resulting in excess inventories and related obsolescence charges that could adversely affect the Company s financial performance.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P14_S5	The Company depends on single source or a limited number of suppliers for some of its products, and the loss of any of these suppliers could harm its business.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Company is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for its clubheads and shafts, some of which are single sourced.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	techniques and processes which make it difficult to identify and utilize alternative suppliers quickly.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In addition, many of the Company s suppliers are not well capitalized and prolonged unfavorable economic conditions could increase the risk that they will go out of business.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If current suppliers are unable to deliver clubheads, shafts or other components, or if the Company is required to transition to other suppliers, the Company could experience significant production delays or disruption to its business.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P16_S3	The Company also depends on a single or a limited number of suppliers for the materials it uses to make its golf balls.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Many of these materials are customized for the Company.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Any delay or interruption in such supplies could have a material adverse impact upon the Company s golf ball business.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P16_S6	If the Company did experience any such delays or interruptions, the Company may not be able to find adequate alternative suppliers at a reasonable cost or without significant disruption to its business.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P16_S7	A significant disruption in the operations of the Company s golf club assembly and golf ball manufacturing and assembly facilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company s sales, profitability and results of operations.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P16_S8	A significant amount of the Company s golf club products are assembled at and shipped from its facilities in Carlsbad, California and a significant amount of the Company s golf ball products are manufactured at and shipped from its facilities in Chicopee, Massachusetts.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P16_S9	During the third quarter of 2010, the Company announced its plans to move most of the golf club assembly and golf ball manufacturing and assembly operations to its new facilities in Mexico.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P16_S10	This transition could result in a significant disruption to the operation of these facilities, which could substantially disrupt the Company s global supply chain coordination for the relevant golf club or golf ball business segment, including damage to inventory at the respective facilities.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P16_S11	In addition, the Company could incur significantly higher costs and longer delivery times associated with fulfilling orders and distributing product.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P16_S12	As a result, a significant disruption at any of the Company s golf club or golf ball manufacturing facilities as a result of the transition of the facilities to Mexico or otherwise could adversely affect the Company s sales, profitability and results of operations.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	If the Company is unable to obtain at reasonable costs materials or electricity necessary for the manufacture of its products, its business could be adversely affected.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The Company s size has made it a large consumer of certain materials, including steel, titanium alloys, carbon fiber and rubber.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The Company does not produce these materials itself, and must rely on its ability to obtain adequate supplies in the world marketplace in competition with other users of such materials.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	In the future, the Company may not be able to obtain its requirements for such materials at a reasonable price or at all.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P18_S3	An interruption in the supply of the materials used by the Company or a significant change in costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The Company s golf club and golf ball manufacturing facilities use, among other resources, significant quantities of electricity to operate.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	An interruption in the supply of electricity or a significant increase in the cost of electricity could have a significant adverse effect upon the Company s results of operations.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	A disruption in the service or a significant increase in the cost of the Company s primary delivery and shipping services for its products and component parts could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The Company uses United Parcel Service ( UPS ) for substantially all ground shipments of products to its U.S. customers.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The Company uses air carriers and ocean shipping services for most of its international shipments of products.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Furthermore, many of the components the Company uses to build its golf clubs, including clubheads and shafts, are shipped to the Company via air carrier and ship services.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P20_S3	The Company s inbound and outbound shipments are particularly dependent upon air carrier facilities at Los Angeles International Airport and ship service facilities at the Port of Los Angeles (Long Beach).
837465_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	alternative suppliers or to receive or ship goods through alternate sites in order to deliver its products or components in a timely and cost-efficient manner.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	As a result, the Company could experience manufacturing delays, increased manufacturing and shipping costs, and lost sales as a result of missed delivery deadlines and product demand cycles.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Any significant interruption in UPS services, air carrier services or ship services could have a material adverse effect upon the Company s business.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Furthermore, if the cost of delivery or shipping services were to increase significantly and the additional costs could not be covered by product pricing, the Company s operating results could be significantly adversely affected.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P21_S4	The Company faces intense competition in each of its markets and if it is unable to maintain a competitive advantage, loss of market share, revenue, or profitability may result.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The golf club business is highly competitive, and is served by a number of well-established and well-financed companies with recognized brand names.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	New product introductions, price reductions, consignment sales, extended payment terms, closeouts, including closeouts of products that were recently commercially successful, and significant tour and advertising spending by competitors continue to generate intense market competition.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Furthermore, continued downward pressure on pricing in the market for new clubs could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s pre-owned club business as the gap narrows between the cost of a new club and a pre-owned club.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Successful marketing activities, discounted pricing, consignment sales, extended payment terms or new product introductions by competitors could negatively impact the Company s future sales.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The golf ball business is also highly competitive.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	There are a number of well-established and well-financed competitors, including one competitor with an estimated U.S. market share of approximately 50%.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	As the Company s competitors continue to incur significant costs in the areas of advertising, tour and other promotional support, the Company will continue to incur significant expenses in both tour and advertising support and product development.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Unless there is a change in competitive conditions, these competitive pressures and increased costs will continue to adversely affect the profitability of the Company s golf ball business.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The Company s accessories include golf bags, golf gloves, golf footwear, golf and lifestyle apparel and other items.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The Company faces significant competition in every region with respect to each of these product categories.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In most cases, the Company is not the market leader with respect to its accessory markets.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P24_S3	The Company s golf ball business has a concentrated customer base.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P24_S4	The loss of one or more of the Company s top customers could have a significant negative impact on this business.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P24_S5	On a consolidated basis, no one customer that distributes golf clubs or golf balls in the United States accounted for more than 6% of the Company s consolidated revenues in 2010 and 2009 and 5% in 2008.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P24_S6	On a segment basis, the golf ball customer base is much more concentrated than the golf club customer base.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P24_S7	In 2010, the top five golf ball customers accounted for approximately 22% of the Company s total consolidated golf ball sales.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P24_S8	A loss of one or more of these customers could have a significant adverse effect upon the Company s golf ball sales.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P24_S9	International political instability and terrorist activities may decrease demand for the Company s products and disrupt its business.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P24_S10	Terrorist activities and armed conflicts could have an adverse effect upon the United States or worldwide economy and could cause decreased demand for the Company s products as consumers attention and interest are diverted from golf and become focused on issues relating to these events.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P24_S11	If such events disrupt domestic or international air, ground or sea shipments, or the operation of the Company s manufacturing facilities, the Company s ability to obtain the materials necessary to produce its products, to manufacture its products, and to deliver customer orders would be harmed, which would have a significant adverse affect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P24_S12	Furthermore, such events can negatively impact tourism, which could adversely affect the Company s sales to retailers at resorts and other vacation destinations.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The Company s business could be harmed by the occurrence of natural disasters or pandemic diseases.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, flood or hurricane, or the outbreak of a pandemic disease, could significantly adversely affect the Company s business.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	A natural disaster or a pandemic disease could significantly adversely affect both the demand for the Company s products as well as the supply of the components used to make the Company s products.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Demand for golf products also could be negatively affected as consumers in the affected regions restrict their recreational activities and as tourism to those areas declines.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P25_S4	If the Company s suppliers experienced a significant disruption in their business as a result of a natural disaster or pandemic disease, the Company s ability to obtain the necessary components to make its products could be significantly adversely affected.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P25_S5	In addition, the occurrence of a natural disaster or the outbreak of a pandemic disease generally restricts the travel to and from the affected areas, making it more difficult in general to manage the Company s international operations.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P25_S6	The Company s business and operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could result in fluctuations in its operating results and stock price.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The Company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The Company s first quarter sales generally represent the Company s sell-in to the golf retail channel of its golf club products for the new golf season.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Orders for many of these sales are received during the fourth quarter of the prior year.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	The Company s second and third quarter sales generally represent reorder business for golf clubs.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Sales of golf clubs during the second and third quarters are significantly affected not only by the sell-through of the Company s products that were sold into the channel during the first quarter but also by the sell-through of products by the Company s competitors.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Retailers are sometimes reluctant to reorder the Company s products in significant quantity when they already have excess inventory of products of the Company or its competitors.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The Company s sales of golf balls are generally associated with the level of rounds played in the areas where the Company s products are sold.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Therefore, golf ball sales tend to be greater in the second and third quarters, when the weather is good in most of the Company s key markets and rounds played are up.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Golf ball sales are also stimulated by product introductions as the retail channel takes on initial supplies.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Like golf clubs, reorders of golf balls depend on the rate of sell-through.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The Company s sales during the fourth quarter are generally significantly less than the other quarters because in many of the Company s principal markets fewer people are playing golf during that time of year due to cold weather.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Furthermore, the Company generally announces its new product line in the fourth quarter to allow retailers to plan for the new golf season.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Such early announcements of new products could cause golfers, and therefore the Company s customers, to defer purchasing additional golf equipment until the Company s new products are available.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Such deferments could have a material adverse effect upon sales of the Company s current products or result in closeout sales at reduced prices.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P29_S5	The seasonality of the Company s business could exacerbate the adverse effects of unusual or severe weather conditions on the Company s business.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Due to the seasonality of the Company s business, the Company s business can be significantly adversely affected by unusual or severe weather conditions.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Unfavorable weather conditions generally result in fewer golf rounds played, which generally results in reduced demand for all golf products, and in particular, golf balls.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Furthermore, catastrophic storms can negatively affect golf rounds played both during the storms and afterward, as storm damaged golf courses are repaired and golfers focus on repairing the damage to their homes, businesses and communities.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Consequently, sustained adverse weather conditions, especially during the warm weather months, could materially affect the Company s sales.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations and shareholders equity.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P30_S5	The Company s goodwill and intangible assets consist of goodwill from acquisitions, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, patents, and other intangible assets.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Accounting rules require that the Company s goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be evaluated for impairment at least annually.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In addition, accounting rules require that the Company s goodwill and intangible assets, including intangible assets with definite lives, be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Such indicators include a sustained decline in the Company s stock price or market capitalization, adverse changes in economic or market conditions or prospects, and changes in the Company s operations.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	An asset is considered to be impaired when its carrying value exceeds its fair value.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The Company determines the fair value of an asset based upon the discounted cash flows expected to be realized from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	If in conducting an impairment evaluation the Company were to determine that the carrying value of an asset exceeded its fair value, the Company would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P33_S2	If a significant amount of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets were deemed to be impaired, the Company s results of operations and shareholders equity would be significantly adversely affected.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P33_S3	The Company s ability to utilize all or a portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets may be limited significantly if the Company experiences an ownership change.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P33_S4	The Company has a significant amount of U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs ) and other losses.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P33_S5	The Company s ability to utilize the losses to offset future taxable income may be limited significantly if the Company were to experience an ownership change as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
837465_11_ITEM1A_P33_S6	In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in ownership of the Company s stock by 5-percent shareholders (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P33_S7	The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred for purposes of Section 382 is complex and requires significant judgment.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P33_S8	The extent to which the Company s ability to utilize the losses is limited as a result of such an ownership change depends on many variables, including the value of the Company s stock at the time of the ownership change.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P33_S9	Although the Company s ownership has changed significantly during the three-year period ended December 31, 2010 (due in significant part to the Company s June 2009 preferred stock offering), the Company does not believe there has been a cumulative increase in ownership in excess of 50 percentage points during that period.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P33_S10	The Company continues to monitor changes in ownership.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P33_S11	If such a cumulative increase did occur in any three year period and the Company were limited in the amount of losses it could use to offset taxable income, the Company s results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P33_S12	Changes in equipment standards under applicable Rules of Golf could adversely affect the Company s business.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P33_S13	The Company seeks to have its new golf club and golf ball products satisfy the standards published by the USGA and the R A in the Rules of Golf because these standards are generally followed by golfers, both professional and amateur, within their respective jurisdictions.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P33_S14	The USGA publishes rules that are generally followed in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and the R A publishes rules that are generally followed in most other countries throughout the world.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P33_S15	However, the Rules of Golf as published by the R A and the USGA are virtually the same, and are intended to be so pursuant to a Joint Statement of Principles issued in 2001.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In the future, existing USGA and/or R A standards may be altered in ways that adversely affect the sales of the Company s current or future products.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If a change in rules were adopted and caused one or more of the Company s current or future products to be nonconforming, the Company s sales of such products would be adversely affected.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The Company s sales could decline if professional golfers do not endorse or use the Company s products.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The Company establishes relationships with professional golfers in order to evaluate and promote Callaway Golf, Odyssey, Top-Flite and Ben Hogan branded products.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	arrangements with members of the various professional tours, including the Champions Tour, the PGA Tour, the LPGA Tour, the PGA European Tour, the Japan Golf Tour and the Nationwide Tour.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	While most professional golfers fulfill their contractual obligations, some have been known to stop using a sponsor s products despite contractual commitments.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	If certain of the Company s professional endorsers were to stop using the Company s products contrary to their endorsement agreements, the Company s business could be adversely affected in a material way by the negative publicity or lack of endorsement.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The Company believes that professional usage of its golf clubs and golf balls contributes to retail sales.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The Company therefore spends a significant amount of money to secure professional usage of its products.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Many other companies, however, also aggressively seek the patronage of these professionals and offer many inducements, including significant cash incentives and specially designed products.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	There is a great deal of competition to secure the representation of tour professionals.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	As a result, it is generally becoming increasingly difficult and more expensive to attract and retain such tour professionals.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P39_S2	The inducements offered by other companies could result in a decrease in usage of the Company s products by professional golfers or limit the Company s ability to attract other tour professionals.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P39_S3	A decline in the level of professional usage of the Company s products could have a material adverse effect on the Company s sales and business.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Failure to adequately enforce the Company s intellectual property rights could adversely affect its business.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The golf club industry, in general, has been characterized by widespread imitation of popular club designs.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The Company has an active program of monitoring, investigating and enforcing its proprietary rights against companies and individuals who market or manufacture counterfeits and knockoff products.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The Company asserts its rights against infringers of its copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade dress.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P41_S2	However, these efforts may not be successful in reducing sales of golf products by these infringers.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Additionally, other golf club manufacturers may be able to produce successful golf clubs which imitate the Company s designs without infringing any of the Company s copyrights, patents, trademarks, or trade dress.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P41_S4	The failure to prevent or limit such infringers or imitators could adversely affect the Company s reputation and sales.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P41_S5	The Company may become subject to intellectual property suits that could cause it to incur significant costs or pay significant damages or that could prohibit it from selling its products.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P41_S6	The Company s competitors also seek to obtain patent, trademark, copyright or other protection of their proprietary rights and designs for golf clubs and golf balls.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P41_S7	From time to time, third parties have claimed or may claim in the future that the Company s products infringe upon their proprietary rights.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P41_S8	The Company evaluates any such claims and, where appropriate, has obtained or sought to obtain licenses or other business arrangements.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P41_S9	To date, there have been no significant interruptions in the Company s business as a result of any claims of infringement.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P41_S10	However, in the future, intellectual property claims could force the Company to alter its existing products or withdraw them from the market or could delay the introduction of new products.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Various patents have been issued to the Company s competitors in the golf industry and these competitors may assert that the Company s golf products infringe their patent or other proprietary rights.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	If the Company s golf products are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights, the Company may be unable to obtain a license to use such technology, and it could incur substantial costs to redesign its products or to defend legal actions.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The Company s brands may be damaged by the actions of its licensees.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The Company licenses its trademarks to third-party licensees who produce, market and sell their products bearing the Company s trademarks.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The Company chooses its licensees carefully and imposes upon such licensees various restrictions on the products, and on the manner, on which such trademarks may be used.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P44_S2	In addition, the Company requires its licensees to abide by certain standards of conduct and the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Company s brands could be damaged.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	The Company s brands could also be damaged if a licensee becomes insolvent or by any negative publicity concerning a licensee or if the licensee does not maintain good relationships with its customers or consumers, many of which are also the Company s customers and consumers.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Sales of the Company s products by unauthorized retailers or distributors could adversely affect the Company s authorized distribution channels and harm the Company s reputation.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Some of the Company s products find their way to unauthorized outlets or distribution channels.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P45_S4	This gray market for the Company s products can undermine authorized retailers and foreign wholesale distributors who promote and support the Company s products, and can injure the Company s image in the minds of its customers and consumers.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P45_S5	On the other hand, stopping such commerce could result in a potential decrease in sales to those customers who are selling the Company s products to unauthorized distributors or an increase in sales returns over historical levels.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P45_S6	While the Company has taken some lawful steps to limit commerce of its products in the gray market in both the United States and abroad, it has not stopped such commerce.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The Company has significant international operations and is exposed to risks associated with doing business globally.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The Company s management believes that controlling the distribution of its products in certain major markets in the world has been and will be an element in the future growth and success of the Company.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The Company sells and distributes its products directly in many key international markets in Europe, Asia, North America and elsewhere around the world.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	These activities have resulted and will continue to result in investments in inventory, accounts receivable, employees, corporate infrastructure and facilities.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P47_S2	In addition, there are a limited number of suppliers of golf club components in the United States, and the Company has increasingly become more reliant on suppliers and vendors located outside of the United States.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P47_S3	The operation of foreign distribution in the Company s international markets, as well as the management of relationships with international suppliers and vendors, will continue to require the dedication of management and other Company resources.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The Company also manufactures a substantial amount of its products outside of the United States.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P48_S1	As a result of this international business, the Company is exposed to increased risks inherent in conducting business outside of the United States.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In addition to foreign currency risks, these risks include:
837465_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Increased exposure to interruptions in air carrier or ship services.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Any significant adverse change in circumstances or conditions could have a significant adverse effect upon the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P51_S2	We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Recently proposed legislation in the United States would change how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on their foreign income.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P52_S1	If such legislation is enacted, it may have a material adverse impact to our tax rate and in turn, our profitability.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The Company relies on increasingly complex information systems for management of its manufacturing, distribution, sales and other functions.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P53_S1	If the Company s information systems fail to perform these functions adequately or if the Company experiences an interruption in their operation, its business and results of operations could suffer.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	All of the Company s major operations, including manufacturing, distribution, sales and accounting, are dependent upon the Company s complex information systems.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The Company s information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:
837465_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Hackers, computer viruses, software bugs or glitches.
837465_11_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Any damage or significant disruption in the operation of such systems or the failure of the Company s information systems to perform as expected could disrupt the Company s business, result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess inventory and product shortages and otherwise adversely affect the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	Company occupies six buildings that are utilized in its Carlsbad operations, which are comprised of corporate offices and the Company s performance center, as well as manufacturing, research and development, warehousing and distribution facilities.
837465_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	These buildings comprise approximately 666,000 square feet of space.
837465_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	The Company owns five of these buildings, representing approximately 516,000 square feet of space, and leases a property representing approximately 150,000 square feet of space.
837465_11_ITEM2_P0_S3	The lease term expires in November 2017.
837465_11_ITEM2_P0_S4	The Company also owns a manufacturing plant, warehouse and offices that encompass approximately 869,000 square feet in Chicopee, Massachusetts in addition to a property in Gloversville, New York of approximately 77,000 square feet, representing a former golf ball manufacturing facility.
837465_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	and distribution centers located in Carlsbad, California, Toronto, Canada, and Chicopee, Massachusetts, the creation of third-party logistics sites in Dallas, Texas and Toronto, Canada, as well as the establishment of a new production facility in Monterrey, Mexico.
837465_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	In connection with the new production facility in Monterrey, Mexico, the Company leases a property of approximately 180,000 square feet.
837465_11_ITEM2_P1_S2	The Company intends to maintain limited manufacturing and distribution facilities in Carlsbad, California and Chicopee, Massachusetts.
837465_11_ITEM2_P1_S3	The Company owns and leases additional properties domestically and internationally, including properties in Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom, China, Thailand, Malaysia and India.
837465_11_ITEM2_P1_S4	The Company s operations at each of these properties are used to some extent for both the golf club and golf ball businesses.
837465_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Company believes that its facilities currently are adequate to meet its requirements.
837465_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Company s common stock is listed, and principally traded, on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ).
837465_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	The Company s symbol for its common stock is ELY.
837465_11_ITEM5_P0_S2	As of January 31, 2011, the approximate number of holders of record of the Company s common stock was 8,400.
837465_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table sets forth the range of high and low per share sales prices of the Company s common stock and per share dividends for the periods indicated.
837465_11_ITEM5_P1_S1	The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and quarterly determinations that cash dividends are in the best interests of its stockholders.
837465_11_ITEM5_P1_S2	Future dividends may be affected by, among other items, the Company s views on potential future capital requirements, projected cash flows and needs, changes to our business model and certain restrictions limiting dividends imposed by the Company s Line of Credit (see Item 7 Sources of Liquidity below).
837465_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	Performance Graph The following graph presents a comparison of the cumulative total shareholder return of the Company s common stock since December 31, 2005 to three indices: the Standard Poor s 500 Index ( S P 500 ), the Standard Poor s 400 Midcap Index ( S P 400 ) and the Standard Poor s 600 Smallcap Index ( S P 600 ).
837465_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	The S P 500 tracks the aggregate price performance of equity securities of 500 large-cap companies that are actively traded in the U.S., and is considered to be a leading indicator of U.S. equity securities.
837465_11_ITEM5_P3_S1	The S P 400 is a market value-weighted index that tracks the aggregate price performance of equity securities of companies with a market capitalization of $750.0 million to $3.0 billion from all major industries, including energy, technology, healthcare, financial and manufacturing.
837465_11_ITEM5_P3_S2	The S P 600 is a market value-weighted index that tracks the aggregate price performance of equity securities from a broad range of small-cap stocks traded in the U.S.
837465_11_ITEM5_P3_S3	The Company believes that the S P 600 is a more representative peer group than the S P 400 as it is more aligned with the Company s market capitalization.
837465_11_ITEM5_P3_S4	As such, the Company has elected to change its peer group from the S P 400 to the S P 600 as of January 1, 2010.
837465_11_ITEM5_P3_S5	The graph below presents both the S P 400 and S P 600 for comparative purposes.
837465_11_ITEM5_P3_S6	The graph assumes an initial investment of $100 at December 31, 2005 and reinvestment of all dividends.
837465_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	The Callaway Golf Company index is based upon the closing prices of Callaway Golf Company common stock on December 31, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 of $13.84, $14.41, $17.43, $9.29, $7.54 and $8.07, respectively.
837465_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers In November 2007, the Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program (the November 2007 repurchase program ) for the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock up to a maximum cost to the Company of $100.0 million, which will remain in effect until completed or otherwise terminated by the Board of Directors.
837465_11_ITEM5_P5_S1	During the three months ended December 31, 2010, the Company repurchased a nominal number of shares of its common stock at a weighted average cost per share of $7.68 under the November 2007 repurchase program.
837465_11_ITEM5_P5_S2	The Company acquired these shares to satisfy the Company s tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting and settlement of employee restricted stock unit awards.
837465_11_ITEM5_P5_S3	As of December 31, 2010, the Company remained authorized to repurchase up to an additional $75.2 million of its common stock under this program.
837465_11_ITEM5_P5_S4	The following table summarizes the purchases by the Company under its repurchase programs during the fourth quarter of 2010 (in thousands, except per share data):
837465_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	Consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the related consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 and notes thereto appear elsewhere in this report.

837465_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations, financial condition and liquidity are based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
837465_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, shareholders equity, sales and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
837465_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
837465_11_ITEM7_P1_S3	Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
837465_11_ITEM7_P1_S4	On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business and new information as it becomes available.
837465_11_ITEM7_P1_S5	Management believes the critical accounting policies discussed below affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
837465_11_ITEM7_P1_S6	For a complete discussion of all of the Company s significant accounting policies, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, as products are shipped to customers, net of an allowance for sales returns and accruals for sales programs.
837465_11_ITEM7_P1_S7	The Company records a reserve for anticipated returns through a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the period that the related sales are recorded.
837465_11_ITEM7_P1_S8	Sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through of products.
837465_11_ITEM7_P1_S9	In addition, from time to time, the Company offers sales programs that allow for specific returns.
837465_11_ITEM7_P1_S10	The Company records a reserve for anticipated returns related to these sales programs based on the terms of the sales program as well as historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through of products.
837465_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	Historically, the Company s actual sales returns have not been materially different from management s original estimates.
837465_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance for sales returns.
837465_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	However, if the actual costs of sales returns are significantly different than the recorded estimated allowance, the Company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
837465_11_ITEM7_P2_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase in the Company s 2010 sales returns, pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 would have been increased by approximately $3.0 million.
837465_11_ITEM7_P2_S4	The Company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings.
837465_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program, management s forecast of future product demand, and historical customer participation in similar programs.
837465_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Company s primary sales program, the Preferred Retailer Program, offers longer payment terms during the initial sell in period, as well as potential rebates and discounts, for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the Company, including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels, prime product placement and retailer staff training.
837465_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	Under this program, qualifying retailers can earn either discounts or rebates based upon the amount of product purchased.
837465_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	Discounts are applied and recorded at the time of sale.
837465_11_ITEM7_P4_S3	For rebates, the Company accrues an estimate of the rebate at the time of sale based on the customer s estimated qualifying current year product purchases.
837465_11_ITEM7_P4_S4	The estimate is based on the historical level of purchases, adjusted for any factors expected to affect the current year purchase levels.
837465_11_ITEM7_P4_S5	The estimated year-end rebate is adjusted quarterly based on actual purchase levels, as necessary.
837465_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Preferred Retailer Program is generally short term in nature and the actual costs of the program are known as of the end of the year and paid to customers shortly after year-end.
837465_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	Preferred Retailer Program, the Company from time to time offers additional sales program incentive offerings which are also generally short term in nature.
837465_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Historically the Company s actual costs related to its Preferred Retailer Program and other sales programs have not been materially different than its estimates.
837465_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed.
837465_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	In addition, the Company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws.
837465_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	The Company s gift cards have no expiration.
837465_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	To determine when redemption is remote, the Company analyzes an aging of unredeemed cards (based on the date the card was last used or the activation date if the card has never been used) and compares that information with historical redemption trends.
837465_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to determine the timing of recognition of gift card revenues.
837465_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	However, if the Company is not able to accurately determine when gift card redemption is remote, the Company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
837465_11_ITEM7_P9_S3	The deferred revenue associated with outstanding gift cards decreased from $4.5 million at December 31, 2009 to $3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2010.
837465_11_ITEM7_P9_S4	Revenues from course credits in connection with the use of the Company s uPro GPS on-course range finders are deferred when purchased and recognized when customers download the course credits for usage.
837465_11_ITEM7_P9_S5	Deferred revenue associated with unused course credits increased to $2.6 million at December 31, 2010 from $1.5 million at December 31, 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments.
837465_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	An estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, the customer s financial condition and current economic trends, all of which are subject to change.
837465_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	If the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance, the Company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected.
837465_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase in the Company s 2010 allowance for doubtful accounts, pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 would have been increased by approximately $0.9 million.
837465_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value.
837465_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
837465_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	The inventory balance, which includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs, is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory.
837465_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	The estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon current inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience as well as management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand, all of which are subject to change.
837465_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	The calculation of the Company s allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand and pricing, regulatory (USGA and R A) rule changes, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence.
837465_11_ITEM7_P13_S3	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance.
837465_11_ITEM7_P13_S4	However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner, the Company may need to increase its inventory allowance, which could significantly adversely affect the Company s operating results.
837465_11_ITEM7_P13_S5	Assuming there had been a 10% increase in the Company s 2010 allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory, pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 would have been increased by approximately $2.1 million.
837465_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company acquires tangible and intangible assets.
837465_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment, investments, goodwill and other intangible assets) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable or exceeds its fair value.
837465_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining the amount of undiscounted cash flows directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, the timing of the impairment test, and the asset s residual value, if any.
837465_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	To determine fair value, the Company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate.
837465_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the asset and a charge to earnings.
837465_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	The Company uses its best judgment based on current facts and circumstances related to its business when making these estimates.
837465_11_ITEM7_P15_S3	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses.
837465_11_ITEM7_P15_S4	However, if actual results are not consistent with the Company s estimates and assumptions used in calculating future cash flows and asset fair values, the Company may be exposed to losses that could be material.
837465_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company conducted its annual impairment test on its goodwill and intangible assets, including the trade names, trademarks and other intangible assets the Company acquired in 2003 as part of the acquisition of the assets of TFGC Estate, Inc. (f/k/a The Top-Flite Golf Company).
837465_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	In completing the impairment analysis, the Company determined that the discounted expected cash flows from the trade names and trademarks associated with the acquisition was $7.5 million less than the carrying value of those assets.
837465_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $7.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2010.
837465_11_ITEM7_P16_S3	The Company has a stated two-year warranty policy for its golf clubs.
837465_11_ITEM7_P16_S4	The Company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded.
837465_11_ITEM7_P16_S5	In estimating its future warranty obligations, the Company considers various relevant factors, including the Company s stated warranty policies and practices, the historical frequency of claims, and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty.
837465_11_ITEM7_P16_S6	The Company s estimates for calculating the warranty reserve are principally based on assumptions regarding the warranty costs of each club product line over the expected warranty period, where little or no claims experience may exist.
837465_11_ITEM7_P16_S7	Experience has shown that warranty rates can vary between product models.
837465_11_ITEM7_P16_S8	Therefore, the Company s warranty obligation calculation is based upon long-term historical warranty rates until sufficient data is available.
837465_11_ITEM7_P16_S9	As actual model-specific rates become available, the Company s estimates are modified to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes.
837465_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Historically, the Company s actual warranty claims have not been materially different from management s original estimated warranty obligation.
837465_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the warranty obligation.
837465_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	However, if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims significantly exceeds the estimated warranty reserve, the Company may be exposed to losses that could be material.
837465_11_ITEM7_P17_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase in the Company s 2010 warranty obligation, pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 would have been increased by approximately $0.8 million.
837465_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Income Taxes Current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year.
837465_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
837465_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	The Company provides a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
837465_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
837465_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	Likewise, should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be a charge to income in the period such determination was made.
837465_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Pursuant to ASC Topic 740-25-6, the Company is required to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to pay such additional taxes.
837465_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than 50% likelihood of being sustained.
837465_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions.
837465_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	The preparation of these income tax returns requires the Company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by the Company.
837465_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	As required under applicable accounting rules, the Company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability, including interest and penalties, for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return.
837465_11_ITEM7_P21_S3	The Company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available.
837465_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Historically, additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the Company s uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the Company s expectations.
837465_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	Information regarding income taxes is contained in Note 16 Income Taxes to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
837465_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Share-based Compensation The Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values.
837465_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	ASC Topic 718 further requires a reduction in share-based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	The forfeiture rate used by the Company is based on historical forfeiture trends.
837465_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	If actual forfeitures are not consistent with the Company s estimates, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods.
837465_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant.
837465_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the Company s expected stock price volatility, the expected dividend yield, the expected life of an option and the risk-free rate, which is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option.
837465_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected price volatility and the expected option life.
837465_11_ITEM7_P25_S3	The Company uses forecasted dividends to estimate the expected dividend yield.
837465_11_ITEM7_P25_S4	The Company believes a forecasted calculation is more appropriate than using historical data since the amount of dividends paid have decreased beginning in 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option.
837465_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee.
837465_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
837465_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Company records compensation expense for Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units (collectively restricted stock ) based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
837465_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	The estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the award date multiplied by the number of shares underlying the restricted stock awarded.
837465_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	Compensation expense related to unvested shares is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, reduced by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Phantom Stock Units are a form of share-based awards that are indexed to the Company s stock and are settled in cash.
837465_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	They are accounted for as a liability, which are initially measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant.
837465_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	The estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares underlying phantom stock.
837465_11_ITEM7_P29_S3	The liability is subsequently remeasured based on the fair value of the awards at the end of each interim reporting period through the settlement date of the awards.
837465_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	Total compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
837465_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	Recent Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by this reference.
837465_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	uPlay Asset Acquisition On December 31, 2008, the Company acquired certain assets and liabilities of uPlay, LLC ( uPlay ), a developer and marketer of GPS devices that provide accurate on-course measurements utilizing aerial imagery of each golf hole.
837465_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	The Company acquired uPlay in order to form synergies from co-branding these products with the Callaway Golf brand, promote the global distribution of these products through the Company s existing sales force and create incremental new business opportunities.
837465_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	Under SFAS No. 141, the estimated aggregate cost of the acquired assets was $11.4 million, which includes cash paid of $9.9 million, transaction costs of approximately $0.2 million, and assumed liabilities of approximately $1.3 million.
837465_11_ITEM7_P31_S3	The aggregate acquisition costs exceeded the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired.
837465_11_ITEM7_P31_S4	As a result, the Company has recorded goodwill of $0.6 million, none of which is deductible for tax purposes.
837465_11_ITEM7_P31_S5	The Company has recorded the fair values of uPlay s database and technology, trademarks and trade names, and non-compete agreements in the amounts of $7.9 million, $0.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, using an income valuation approach.
837465_11_ITEM7_P31_S6	This valuation technique provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on the cash flows that the asset can be expected to generate over its remaining useful life.
837465_11_ITEM7_P31_S7	These intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 4 to 8 years.
837465_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	In connection with this purchase, the Company could be required to pay an additional purchase price not to exceed $10.0 million based on a percentage of earnings generated from the sale of uPlay products over a period of three years ending on December 31, 2011.
837465_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	Any such additional purchase price paid at the end of the three year period will be recorded as goodwill.
837465_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	The preliminary allocation of the aggregate acquisition costs is as follows (in millions): The pro-forma effects of the uPlay, LLC asset acquisition would not have been material to our results of operations for fiscal year 2008 and, therefore, is not presented.
837465_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	Results of Operations Overview of Business and Seasonality The Company designs, manufactures and sells high quality golf clubs and golf balls and also sells golf and lifestyle apparel, golf footwear, golf bags, gloves, eyewear and other golf-related accessories, including uPro GPS on-course measurement devices.
837465_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	The Company designs its products to be technologically advanced and in this regard invests a considerable amount in research and development each year.
837465_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Company s golf products are designed for golfers of all skill levels, both amateur and professional.
837465_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	The Company has two operating segments that are organized on the basis of products, namely the golf clubs segment and golf balls segment.
837465_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	The golf clubs segment consists primarily of Callaway Golf, Top-Flite and Ben Hogan woods, hybrids, irons, wedges and putters as well as Odyssey putters.
837465_11_ITEM7_P35_S3	This segment also includes other golf-related accessories described above and royalties from licensing of the Company s trademarks and service marks as well as sales of pre-owned golf clubs.
837465_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	The golf balls segment consists primarily of Callaway Golf and Top-Flite golf balls.
837465_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	As discussed in Note 19 Segment Information to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company s operating segments exclude a significant amount of corporate general administrative expenses and other income (expense) not utilized by management in determining segment profitability.
837465_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	In most of the regions where the Company does business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis.
837465_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	Weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year-round, except in a few markets, with many of the Company s on-course customers closing for the cold weather months.
837465_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	The Company s business is therefore also subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_11_ITEM7_P38_S3	In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season.
837465_11_ITEM7_P38_S4	This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter.
837465_11_ITEM7_P38_S5	The Company s second quarter sales are also significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter.
837465_11_ITEM7_P38_S6	The Company s third quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but are generally less than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season.
837465_11_ITEM7_P38_S7	The Company s fourth quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company s key markets.
837465_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	fourth quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year.
837465_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	This seasonality, and therefore quarter to quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions.
837465_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	In general, however, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company s sales and most, if not all, of its profitability generally occurs during the first half of the year.
837465_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Approximately half of the Company s business is conducted outside of the United States and is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
837465_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	As a result, changes in foreign currency rates can have a significant effect on the Company s financial results.
837465_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	The Company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates.
837465_11_ITEM7_P40_S3	While these foreign currency exchange contracts can mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates, they do not eliminate those effects, which can be significant.
837465_11_ITEM7_P40_S4	These effects include (i) the translation of results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, (ii) the mark-to-market adjustments of certain intercompany balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies, and (iii) the mark-to-market adjustments on the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts.
837465_11_ITEM7_P40_S5	In general, the Company s overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts its business.
837465_11_ITEM7_P40_S6	As a result of the overall weakening of the U.S. dollar during 2010 compared to 2009, the translation of foreign currency exchange rates had a net positive impact on the Company s financial results during 2010.
837465_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	When the recent economic crisis hit the golf industry in mid-2008, the Company made the decision to weather the crisis with a balanced approach between managing costs and continuing to invest in initiatives that would benefit its business once the economic crisis subsided and the golf industry recovered.
837465_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	During 2010, the overall golf industry did not recover as management had anticipated.
837465_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	In 2010, the golf industry declined in the United States by approximately 2% compared to 2009, which declined by approximately 12% compared to 2008.
837465_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	The Company believes that there were similar declines in the golf industry internationally.
837465_11_ITEM7_P42_S3	During this period, consistent with its balanced approach strategy, the Company managed its costs but also invested in (i) new and emerging markets such as China, India and other countries in Southeast Asia, (ii) new technology, including its new forged composite technology and its uPro business, (iii) its growing accessories and apparel business, and (iv) in its global operations strategy initiatives targeted at improving gross margins, including the reorganization of its golf club and golf ball manufacturing and distribution operations.
837465_11_ITEM7_P42_S4	Although the Company s overall 2010 financial results were significantly affected by this industry decline and by these investments, as well as by some non-operational charges, the Company is encouraged by signs of improving general economic and market conditions and by improvements in the Company s underlying operational performance as a result of these investments.
837465_11_ITEM7_P42_S5	Despite the overall decline in the golf industry, the Company s net sales in 2010 increased 2% compared to 2009, primarily as a result of favorable foreign currency rates, an overall increase in average selling prices, and increased sales in the Company s accessories and apparel businesses and new and emerging markets.
837465_11_ITEM7_P42_S6	These improvements offset a decline in sales in the United States and Europe, which continued to be adversely affected by constrained consumer spending on discretionary durable products, particularly during the height of the golf season.
837465_11_ITEM7_P42_S7	The Company s gross profit as a percentage of net sales for 2010 improved by 2 percentage points to 38%, compared to 36% for 2009, despite absorbing an incremental $6.7 million in charges in 2010 related to the implementation of the Company s global operations strategy.
837465_11_ITEM7_P42_S8	This 2 percentage points increase is primarily the result of net favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, benefits derived from the Company s prior global operations strategy initiatives, and less promotional activity on in-line products in 2010 compared to 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	During 2010, the Company s operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 41% from 39% in 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	Operating expenses in 2010 include a $7.5 million non-cash impairment charge related to certain intangible assets acquired in 2003 as part of the Top-Flite acquisition.
837465_11_ITEM7_P43_S2	The operating expenses in 2010 also reflect increased costs related to the investments described above and the adverse net effect of changes in foreign currency rates.
837465_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	While the Company s overall net operating results discussed above benefited during 2010 from changes in foreign currency rates related to the translation of the Company s international results into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, these benefits were partially offset by the effect that foreign currency exchange rates had on the Company s other income (expense) for 2010.
837465_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	As a result of the net effect the relatively weak U.S. dollar had on the mark-to-market adjustments on the Company s accounts payable and accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency exchange contracts, the Company s other income (expense) was adversely affected by $11.7 million in 2010 compared to $0.5 million in 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	The Company s net loss increased by $3.5 million to $18.8 million in 2010 compared to $15.3 million in 2009 and loss per share increased to $0.46 in 2010 compared to $0.33 in 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P44_S3	Compared to 2009, the net loss and loss per share for 2010 was adversely affected by (i) the $7.5 million ($0.08 per share) non-cash impairment charge for the Top-Flite intangible assets, (ii) an incremental $5.4 million ($0.09 per share) of charges related to the Company s global operations strategy initiatives, and (iii) by an $11.2 million increase in other expense, primarily resulting from foreign currency exchange rates as discussed above.
837465_11_ITEM7_P44_S4	In addition, as compared to 2009, the Company s loss per share was adversely affected by an incremental $0.07 per share as a result of the Company s June 2009 preferred stock offering, which only affected 2009 results for approximately six months.
837465_11_ITEM7_P44_S5	While the Company s financial performance in 2011 will ultimately depend on the degree to which consumers return to purchasing golf equipment in general, and the Company s new 2011 products in particular, the Company is encouraged by some positive early indicators.
837465_11_ITEM7_P44_S6	Economic and market conditions appear generally to be improving, the price discounting that was pervasive in 2009 appears to have lessened in 2010, the Company s retail inventory levels are at reasonable levels, and the Company received more gold medals than any other manufacturer in Golf Digest s 2011 product review.
837465_11_ITEM7_P44_S7	The Company also expects to realize in 2011 additional benefits from its investments in its new and emerging markets, technology, accessories and apparel businesses and global operations strategy.
837465_11_ITEM7_P44_S8	As a result, the Company expects that in 2011 its underlying operational performance and financial results will continue to improve compared to 2010.
837465_11_ITEM7_P44_S9	Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 Net sales in 2010 increased by $16.9 million (2%) to $967.7 million compared to $950.8 million in 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P44_S10	Global economic conditions continued to be challenging during the current year and the golf industry overall did not recover in 2010 as the Company s management had anticipated at the beginning of the year.
837465_11_ITEM7_P44_S11	Although the unfavorable economic and industry conditions significantly affected sales volumes in 2010, favorable foreign currency rates and an overall increase in average selling prices, as a result of less promotional activity, were able to offset the volume decline.
837465_11_ITEM7_P44_S12	Net sales were favorably impacted by $29.0 million due to changes in foreign currency rates used to translate sales in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.
837465_11_ITEM7_P44_S13	This increase in net sales consists of a $18.9 million increase in net sales of the Company s golf clubs segment partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in net sales of the Company s golf balls segment as presented below (dollars in millions):
837465_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	(1) Certain prior period costs associated with gift card promotions have been reclassified from accessories and other into the applicable product categories to conform with the current year presentation.
837465_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	For further discussion of each operating segment s results, see Golf Club and Golf Ball Segments Results below.
837465_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	Net sales information by region is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	Net sales in the United States decreased $7.2 million (2%) to $468.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	The Company s sales in regions outside of the United States increased $24.1 million (5%) to $499.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	The Company s reported net sales in regions outside the United States in 2010 were favorably affected by the translation of foreign currency sales into U.S. dollars based upon 2010 exchange rates.
837465_11_ITEM7_P47_S3	If 2009 exchange rates were applied to 2010 reported sales in regions outside the United States and all other factors were held constant, net sales in such regions would have been $29.0 million less than the net sales reported during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010.
837465_11_ITEM7_P47_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2010, gross profit increased $21.7 million to $365.5 million from $343.8 million for the comparable period of 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P47_S5	Gross profit as a percentage of net sales ( gross margin ) increased to 38% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 36% for the same period in 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P47_S6	The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to: (i) net favorable changes in foreign currency rates; (ii) cost reductions on golf club components costs; (iii) a favorable shift in sales mix; (iv) lower promotional activity on in-line products in 2010 compared to 2009; and (v) a favorable shift in golf ball production to more cost efficient regions outside the United States.
837465_11_ITEM7_P47_S7	These increases were partially offset by price reductions taken on older golf club products, charges related to the Company s Global Operations Strategy Initiatives and an increase in excess and obsolete inventory related charges.
837465_11_ITEM7_P47_S8	See Segment Profitability below for further discussion of gross margins.
837465_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	Selling expenses decreased $3.3 million to $257.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $260.6 million in the comparable period of 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses were consistent at 27% in both 2010 and 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	The dollar decrease was primarily due to a $6.9 million reduction in advertising and promotional activities, partially offset by increases of $2.0 million and $1.6 million in consulting and employee related costs, respectively, which include the restoration of employee benefits in 2010 that had been temporarily suspended in 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P48_S3	General and administrative expenses increased $9.4 million to $90.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $81.5 million in the comparable period of 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P48_S4	As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses remained constant at 9% in both 2010 and 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P48_S5	The dollar increase was primarily due to a $7.9 million increase in employee related costs, including the restoration of employee benefits in 2010, as well as $2.0 million in costs associated with the Company s Global Operations Strategy.
837465_11_ITEM7_P48_S6	Research and development expenses increased $4.2 million to $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $32.2 million in the comparable period of 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P48_S7	As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased to 4% in 2010 from 3% in 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P48_S8	The dollar increase was primarily due to a $1.9 million increase in employee related costs, which includes the restoration of employee benefits in 2010, as well as a $1.9 million increase in the allocation of corporate shared building expenses due to an expansion in square footage occupied by the research and development department.
837465_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	Other income (expense), net increased to expense of $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from income of $0.9 million in the comparable period in 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	This $11.9 million increase in expense was primarily attributable to an $11.2 million increase in net foreign currency losses from the mark-to-market of foreign currency exchange contracts in 2010 as compared to 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010, was a benefit of 47.1% compared to a benefit of 48.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	Compared to the corporate statutory rate of 35.0%, the tax rates in 2010 and 2009 benefited from net reductions to previously estimated tax liabilities as a result of the release of tax contingencies related to the settlement of various issues under tax examination and the lapse of certain statutes of limitations.
837465_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased to $18.8 million from $15.3 million in the comparable period of 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P50_S3	Net loss allocable to common shareholders for 2010 and 2009 includes $10.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively, for dividends on preferred stock (as defined in Sources of Liquidity below).
837465_11_ITEM7_P50_S4	Losses per share for 2010 increased to $0.46 per share on 63.9 million weighted average shares outstanding compared to losses per share of $0.33 on 63.2 million weighted average shares outstanding for 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P50_S5	Net loss and losses per share for 2010 were negatively impacted by a $4.8 million ($0.08 per share) after-tax impairment charge related to a reduction in recorded book value of certain intangible assets acquired in 2003 as part of the Top-Flite Acquisition, after-tax charges of $9.2 million ($0.14 per share) in connection with the Company s Global Operations Strategy, and after-tax charges of $2.5 million ($0.04 per share) as a result of workforce reductions announced during the fourth quarter in 2010.
837465_11_ITEM7_P50_S6	Net loss and losses per share for 2009 were negatively impacted by after-tax charges of $3.7 million ($0.06 per share) related to costs incurred in connection with initiatives targeted at improving gross margins as well as by after-tax charges of $3.1 million ($0.05 per share) as a result of the workforce reductions announced in April 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P50_S7	Golf Clubs and Golf Balls Segments Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 Golf Clubs Segment Net sales information for the golf clubs segment by product category is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	(1) Certain prior period costs associated with gift card promotions have been reclassified from accessories and other into the applicable product categories to conform with the current year presentation.
837465_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	The $2.8 million (1%) increase in net sales of woods to $225.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily attributable to an increase in sales volume partially offset by a slight decrease in average selling prices.
837465_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	The increase in sales volume was primarily driven by a 44% increase in sales of fairway woods due to an increase in new fairway woods products in 2010, partially offset by a 20% decrease in sales of drivers, which had fewer new product releases in 2010.
837465_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	The slight decrease in average selling prices was primarily due to close-out activity on older driver models, partially offset by a decrease in promotional activity in 2010.
837465_11_ITEM7_P52_S3	The $9.1 million (4%) decrease in net sales of irons to $223.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily attributable to a decrease in both sales volume and average selling prices.
837465_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	volume was primarily attributable to the later timing of iron models launched in the first half of 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year.
837465_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	The Company launched its X-24 Hot irons in May of 2010 and therefore did not benefit from a full year worth of sales compared to twelve months of sales of the X-22 irons during 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of the Company s current year Diablo Edge irons compared to sales of the Diablo irons launched in 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P53_S3	The decrease in average selling prices was largely due to a shift in product mix with the 2010 launch of more moderately priced Diablo Edge irons compared to the higher priced X-22 and X Forged line of irons launched in 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P53_S4	In addition, average selling prices were negatively affected by increased close-out activity on certain irons and wedges which will be non-conforming in 2011.
837465_11_ITEM7_P53_S5	The $8.1 million (8%) increase in net sales of putters to $106.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily attributable to an increase in average selling prices partially offset by a slight decline in sales volumes.
837465_11_ITEM7_P53_S6	The increases in average selling prices was attributable to sales of the new White Ice series of putters introduced in 2010, which outpaced the decline in sales of the older White Hot XG series of putters.
837465_11_ITEM7_P53_S7	In addition, average selling prices were favorably affected by the current year launch of the premium Black Series iX line of putters and Backstryke putter models, which were introduced at higher prices compared to the models launched in 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P53_S8	The decrease in sales volume was primarily due to a decrease in sales of the Company s progressive putter models and lower close-out sales volumes of older putter models.
837465_11_ITEM7_P53_S9	The $17.1 million (8%) increase in net sales of accessories and other products to $235.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily attributable to: (i) increased sales of packaged sets, which include the current year launch of the women s Solaire line of golf clubs; (ii) increased sales of golf apparel under the Company s new distribution agreement with Perry Ellis International compared to licensing revenues recognized during the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 under the former agreement with the Company s prior licensee; and (iii) increased sales of golf bags.
837465_11_ITEM7_P53_S10	These increases were partially offset by a decline in sales of GPS on-course range finders, golf gloves and golf footwear.
837465_11_ITEM7_P53_S11	Golf Balls Segment Net sales information for the golf balls segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	(1) Certain prior period costs associated with gift card promotions have been reclassified from accessories and other into the applicable product categories to conform with the current year presentation.
837465_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	The $2.0 million (1%) decrease in net sales of golf balls to $176.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to a decrease in sales volume partially offset by an increase in average selling prices.
837465_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	The decrease in sales volume was driven by a decline in sales of TopFlite ball product lines partially offset by an increase in sales of the Callaway Golf product lines (primarily the premium Tour-i series) as well as the introduction of the new Solaire women s line of golf balls.
837465_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	The increase in average selling prices was generated by a shift in product mix to sales of more premium lines of golf balls in 2010 compared to 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Segment Profitability Profitability by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	(1) Certain prior period costs associated with gift card promotions have been reclassified from accessories and other into the applicable product categories to conform with the current year presentation.
837465_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	(2) As a result of the Global Operations Strategy implemented in 2010, during the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company incurred total pre-tax charges of $14.8 million, of which $12.1 million and $0.8 million were absorbed by the Company s golf clubs and golf balls operating segments, respectively.
837465_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company incurred total pre-tax charges of $6.2 million in connection with initiatives targeted at improving gross margins, of which $4.7 million and $1.5 million were absorbed by the Company s golf clubs and golf balls segments, respectively (see Note 3 Restructuring Initiatives in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K).
837465_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	(3) During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company incurred pre-tax charges of $4.0 million related to the workforce reductions announced in the fourth quarter in 2010, of which $1.3 million and $0.2 million were absorbed by the Company s golf clubs and golf balls operating segments, respectively.
837465_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company incurred pre-tax charges of $5.2 million in connection with the workforce reductions announced in April 2009, of which $3.1 million and $0.9 million were absorbed by the Company s golf clubs and golf balls operating segments, respectively.
837465_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	(4) Reconciling items represent the deduction of corporate general and administration expenses and other income (expenses), which are not utilized by management in determining segment profitability.
837465_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	The reconciling items for 2010 include a pre-tax impairment charge of $7.5 million that was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to certain trademarks and trade names (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Goodwill and Intangible Assets in this Form 10-K), and a $11.2 million increase in net realized and unrealized losses related to foreign currency hedging contracts included in other income (expense).
837465_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	For further information on segment reporting see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Segment Information in this Form 10-K. Pre-tax income in the Company s golf clubs operating segment increased to $44.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $41.4 million for the comparable period in 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P60_S3	The increase in the golf clubs operating segment pre-tax income was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales as discussed above combined with an increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses.
837465_11_ITEM7_P60_S4	The increase in gross margin was primarily due to: (i) favorable changes in foreign currency rates; (ii) cost savings provided by the Company s Global Operations Strategy Initiatives, including cost reductions on club components as a result of improved product designs and sourcing of lower cost raw materials; (iii) a favorable shift in product mix within the putters product category; and (iv) a decrease in golf club promotional activity in 2010 compared to 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P60_S5	These increases were partially offset by (i) price reductions taken on older club products in 2010; (ii) an unfavorable shift in product mix within irons products; (iii) charges related to the Company s Global Operations Strategy Initiatives; and (iv) an increase in excess and obsolete inventory related charges primarily for older, incomplete sets of irons and residual golf apparel from the Company s prior licensee arrangement.
837465_11_ITEM7_P60_S6	Pre-tax loss in the Company s golf balls operating segment decreased to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $16.3 million for the comparable period in 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	The increase in gross margin was primarily a result of favorable changes in foreign currency rates, cost savings provided by the Company s Global Operations Strategy Initiatives, including a favorable shift in golf ball production to more cost efficient regions outside the United States, as well as a favorable shift in product mix as a result of increased sales of higher margin Callaway Golf balls in 2010 compared to sales of value priced Top-Flite golf balls in 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	The adverse effects of the weak global economy experienced during 2009 had a significant negative impact on the golf industry in general and on consumer confidence and retailer demand.
837465_11_ITEM7_P61_S2	These conditions were further exacerbated by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_11_ITEM7_P61_S3	These factors contributed to a decline in net sales of $166.4 million (15%) to $950.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $1,117.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
837465_11_ITEM7_P61_S4	This decrease reflects a $121.8 million decline in net sales of the Company s golf club segment and a $44.6 million decline in net sales of the Company s golf balls segment as indicated below (dollars in millions):
837465_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	(1) Certain costs associated with gift card promotions have been reclassified from accessories and other into the applicable product categories to conform with the presentation as of December 31, 2010.
837465_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	The Company s gift card promotions during 2008 did not have a material impact to the Company s results of operations and therefore, the amounts presented for 2008 were not impacted by this reclassification.
837465_11_ITEM7_P62_S2	For further discussion of each operating segment s results, see Golf Club and Golf Ball Segments Results below.
837465_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	Net sales information by region is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	Net sales in the United States decreased $78.6 million (14%) to $475.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008.
837465_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	The Company s sales in regions outside of the United States decreased $87.8 million (16%) to $475.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008.
837465_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	The decrease in net sales in the United States and internationally was primarily attributable to the unfavorable economic conditions experienced in 2009, and a $36.0 million decline in net sales internationally as a result of unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates, primarily in Europe.
837465_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2009, gross profit decreased $143.0 million to $343.8 million from $486.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
837465_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	Gross profit as a percentage of net sales ( gross margin ) decreased to 36% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 compared to 44% for the comparable period in 2008.
837465_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	The decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to the unfavorable economic conditions and the resulting reduction in sales volume during 2009, as well as the impact of sales promotions, price reductions, and unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates.
837465_11_ITEM7_P65_S3	These declines were partially offset by cost reductions on golf club component costs as well as an overall improvement in manufacturing efficiencies for both golf clubs and golf balls as a result of the Company s gross margin improvement initiatives.
837465_11_ITEM7_P65_S4	See Segment Profitability below for further discussion of gross margins.
837465_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	Gross profit for 2009 was negatively affected by charges of $6.2 million related to the Company s gross margin improvement initiatives compared to $12.5 million in 2008.

837465_11_ITEM7_P66_S3	The dollar decrease in selling expenses was primarily due to cost reductions taken by the Company during 2009, which included decreases of $15.5 million in advertising and promotional activities, $5.1 million in employee costs and commissions and $4.6 million in travel and entertainment.
837465_11_ITEM7_P66_S4	General and administrative expenses decreased $4.0 million (5%) to $81.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $85.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

837465_11_ITEM7_P66_S6	The dollar decrease was primarily due to cost reductions taken by the Company during in 2009, including $4.6 million in employee costs.
837465_11_ITEM7_P66_S7	Research and development expenses increased $2.8 million (10%) to $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
837465_11_ITEM7_P66_S8	As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses remained consistent at 3% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.
837465_11_ITEM7_P66_S9	The increase was primarily due to an increase in employee costs as a result of the Company s entrance into the golf electronics market through the acquisition of uPlay, LLC, which was completed in December 2008.
837465_11_ITEM7_P66_S10	Other income decreased by $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, to $0.9 million compared to $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
837465_11_ITEM7_P66_S11	This decrease was attributable to the reversal in 2008 of an energy derivative valuation account, which resulted in a non-cash, non-operational benefit of $19.9 million in other income.
837465_11_ITEM7_P66_S12	For additional information regarding this valuation account, see Note 11 Derivatives and Hedging to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. This decrease in other income was partially offset by a favorable decline of $2.9 million in interest expense due to a decrease in average borrowings outstanding under the Company s line of credit.
837465_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009, was 48.5% compared to 34.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008.
837465_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	The tax rate in 2009 benefited from net favorable adjustments to previously estimated tax liabilities from the release of tax contingencies related to the settlement of various issues under tax examination and the expiration of the statute of limitations in significant states.
837465_11_ITEM7_P67_S2	The relative impact of these discrete events when compared to the pre-tax loss for 2009 was greater than the relative impact of similar discrete events when compared to pre-tax income for the prior year.
837465_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	Net income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2009, declined by $81.5 million to a net loss of $15.3 million from net income of $66.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
837465_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	Diluted earnings (loss) per common share decreased to a loss of $0.33 per share (based on 63.2 million weighted average shares outstanding) in the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 compared to diluted earnings of $1.04 per share (based on 63.8 million weighted average shares outstanding) in the comparable period of 2008.
837465_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	costs incurred in connection with the Company s gross margin initiatives and $3.1 million ($0.05 per share) as a result of the workforce reductions announced in April 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	In addition, net loss allocable to common shareholders and loss per share for 2009 were negatively affected by dividends on convertible preferred stock of $5.7 million ($0.09 per share).
837465_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	In 2008, net income and earnings per share were favorably affected by the reversal of a $19.9 million energy derivative valuation account, as mentioned above, which resulted in an after-tax benefit of $14.1 million ($0.22 per share).
837465_11_ITEM7_P69_S3	In 2008, net income and earnings per share were negatively affected by after-tax charges of $7.8 million ($0.12 per share) related to costs associated with the implementation of the Company s gross margin improvement initiatives.
837465_11_ITEM7_P69_S4	The overall decrease in net sales in 2009 was primarily due to the weak global economy as discussed above and its continued adverse effects on consumer confidence and retailer demand, which negatively affected sales volumes and average selling prices as further discussed below.
837465_11_ITEM7_P69_S5	This decline in net sales was further exacerbated by an unfavorable shift in foreign currency rates as a result of the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts its business during 2009 compared to 2008.
837465_11_ITEM7_P69_S6	Golf Clubs Segment Net sales information for the golf clubs segment by product category is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	(1) Certain costs associated with gift card promotions have been reclassified from accessories and other into the applicable product categories to conform with the presentation as of December 31, 2010.
837465_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	The Company s gift card promotions during 2008 did not have a material impact to the Company s results of operations and therefore, the amounts presented for 2008 were not impacted by this reclassification.
837465_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	The $45.7 million (17%) decrease in net sales of woods to $222.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, was primarily attributable to a decrease in average selling prices partially offset by an increase in sales volume.
837465_11_ITEM7_P70_S3	The decrease in average selling prices was primarily due to sales promotions initiated during 2009 and price reductions taken on Fusion Technology drivers and fairway woods during 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P70_S4	In addition, average selling prices were negatively affected by sales of FT-iQ drivers in the current year, which were offered at a lower price point compared to their predecessor, FT-i drivers, in the prior year.
837465_11_ITEM7_P70_S5	The increase in sales volume was primarily due to the success of the sales promotions during 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P70_S6	The $75.6 million (25%) decrease in net sales of irons to $232.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, resulted from a decrease in both average selling prices and sales volume.
837465_11_ITEM7_P70_S7	The decrease in average selling prices was primarily due to price reductions taken on the Company s older irons products that were in the second year of their product lifecycles, primarily X-20 and Big Bertha irons combined with an unfavorable shift in product mix from sales of the more premium Fusion irons during 2008 to sales of lower priced X-series irons during 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P70_S8	The decrease in sales volume was primarily due to fewer irons products offered in 2009 compared to 2008.
837465_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	The $3.6 million (4%) decrease in net sales of putters to $98.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, resulted from a reduction in average selling prices partially offset by an increase in sales volume.
837465_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	The decrease in average selling prices was primarily attributable to an unfavorable shift in product mix from sales of the more premium Black Series putters during 2008 to sales of the lower priced Crimson putters during 2009, which also contributed to the increase in sales volume.
837465_11_ITEM7_P71_S2	In addition, sales volume was positively affected by the launch of the new White Ice putters during the fourth quarter of 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P71_S3	The $3.1 million (1%) increase in sales of accessories and other products to $218.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, was primarily attributable to sales of the Company s new uPro GPS on-course range finders introduced in 2009, partially offset by a decline in sales of golf bags and footwear.
837465_11_ITEM7_P71_S4	Golf Balls Segment Net sales information for the golf balls segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	(1) Certain costs associated with gift card promotions have been reclassified from accessories and other into the applicable product categories to conform with the presentation as of December 31, 2010.
837465_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	The Company s gift card promotions during 2008 did not have a material impact to the Company s results of operations and therefore, the amounts presented for 2008 were not impacted by this reclassification.
837465_11_ITEM7_P72_S2	The $44.6 million (20%) decrease in net sales of golf balls to $178.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, was primarily due to decreases of $32.0 million in Callaway Golf ball sales and $10.0 million in Top-Flite golf balls sales.
837465_11_ITEM7_P72_S3	These decreases were primarily due to decreases in average selling prices and sales volume for both Callaway Golf and Top-Flite golf balls.
837465_11_ITEM7_P72_S4	The decrease in average selling prices was negatively affected by a shift in mix as a result of the launch of moderately priced golf balls in 2009 compared to more premium golf balls in 2008 for both the Callaway Golf and Top-Flite brands, in addition to various sales promotions during 2009 and price reductions taken on older Tour Series golf balls.
837465_11_ITEM7_P72_S5	The decrease in sales volumes was affected by fewer golf ball models launched during 2009 compared to 2008 for both the Callaway Golf and Top-Flite brands.
837465_11_ITEM7_P72_S6	Segment Profitability Profitability by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	(1) Certain costs associated with gift card promotions have been reclassified from accessories and other into the applicable product categories to conform with the presentation as of December 31, 2010.
837465_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	The Company s gift card promotions during 2008 did not have a material impact to the Company s results of operations and therefore, the amounts presented for 2008 were not impacted by this reclassification.
837465_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	(2) The Company has been actively implementing the Company s gross margin improvement initiatives, which were announced during the fourth quarter of 2006.
837465_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	As a result of these initiatives, the Company incurred total pre-tax charges of $6.2 million and $12.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
837465_11_ITEM7_P74_S2	Of these pre-tax charges, $4.7 million and $1.5 million were absorbed by the Company s golf clubs and golf balls operating segments during 2009, respectively, and $6.0 million and $6.5 million were absorbed by the Company s golf clubs and golf balls operating segments during 2008, respectively.
837465_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	(3) In connection with the workforce reductions announced in April 2009, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $5.2 million, of which $3.1 million and $0.9 million were absorbed by the Company s golf clubs and golf balls operating segments, respectively, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	(4) Reconciling items represent the deduction of corporate general and administration expenses and other income (expenses), which are not utilized by management in determining segment profitability.
837465_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	For further information on segment reporting see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Segment Information in this Form 10-K. Reconciling items for 2008 include the reversal of an energy derivative valuation account, which resulted in a non-cash, non-operational benefit to income of $19.9 million.
837465_11_ITEM7_P76_S2	See Note 11 Derivatives and Hedging to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. Pre-tax income in the Company s golf clubs operating segment decreased to $41.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, from $134.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
837465_11_ITEM7_P76_S3	This decrease was primarily attributable to the unfavorable economic conditions which resulted in an overall decline in net sales as discussed above combined with a decline in gross margin.
837465_11_ITEM7_P76_S4	The decline in gross margin is primarily due to sales promotions initiated during 2009 and price reductions taken on drivers and irons, as well as the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates during 2009 compared to 2008.
837465_11_ITEM7_P76_S5	These decreases in gross margin were partially offset by cost savings resulting from the Company s gross margin improvement initiatives, including cost reductions on club components derived from more cost efficient club designs and sourcing of raw materials, a favorable shift in golf club production to more cost efficient regions outside the U.S and an increase in labor efficiencies.
837465_11_ITEM7_P76_S6	Pre-tax income (loss) in the Company s golf balls operating segment decreased to a pre-tax loss of $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, from pre-tax income of $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
837465_11_ITEM7_P76_S7	This decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable economic conditions which resulted in an overall decline in net sales as discussed above as well as a decline in gross margin, which was largely due to various sales promotions initiated during 2009, price reductions taken on older golf ball models as well as increases in the cost of golf ball raw materials.
837465_11_ITEM7_P76_S8	These decreases were partially offset by cost savings resulting from the Company s gross margin improvement initiatives, including a shift in golf ball production to more cost efficient regions outside the U.S. Operating expenses related to both the golf club and golf ball segments decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008 as a result of cost reductions taken by the Company, primarily related to advertising and promotional activities, employee costs, and travel and entertainment expenses as well as a decrease in employee costs.
837465_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	Financial Condition The Company s cash and cash equivalents decreased $23.3 million (30%) to $55.0 million at December 31, 2010, from $78.3 million at December 31, 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	This decrease was primarily due to a net loss of $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010.
837465_11_ITEM7_P77_S2	The Company used cash of $22.2 million to fund capital expenditures and $13.1 million to pay dividends during 2010.
837465_11_ITEM7_P77_S3	These expenditures were partially funded by cash generated from operating activities of $9.6 million during the period.
837465_11_ITEM7_P77_S4	The Company concluded 2010 with no amounts outstanding under its primary credit facility.
837465_11_ITEM7_P77_S5	Management expects to fund the Company s future operations from cash provided by its operating activities combined with borrowings from its current or future credit facilities, as deemed necessary (see further information on the Company s primary credit facility in Sources of Liquidity below).
837465_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	The Company s accounts receivable balance fluctuates throughout the year as a result of the general seasonality of the Company s business.
837465_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	The Company s accounts receivable balance will generally be at its highest during the first and second quarters and decline significantly during the third and fourth quarters as a result of an increase in cash collections and lower sales.
837465_11_ITEM7_P78_S2	As of December 31, 2010, the Company s net accounts receivable increased $4.8 million to $144.6 million from $139.8 million as of December 31, 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P78_S3	This increase was primarily due to an increase in past-due balances partially offset by a reduction in average payment terms.
837465_11_ITEM7_P78_S4	The Company believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2010 is adequate to provide for any potential bad debts.
837465_11_ITEM7_P78_S5	The Company s inventory balance also fluctuates throughout the year as a result of the general seasonality of the Company s business.
837465_11_ITEM7_P78_S6	Generally, the Company s buildup of inventory levels begins during the fourth quarter and continues heavily into the first quarter as well as into the beginning of the second quarter in order to meet demand during the height of the golf season.
837465_11_ITEM7_P78_S7	Inventory levels start to decline toward the end of the second quarter and are at their lowest during the third quarter.
837465_11_ITEM7_P78_S8	The Company s net inventory increased $49.4 million to $268.6 million as of December 31, 2010 compared to $219.2 million as of December 31, 2009.
837465_11_ITEM7_P78_S9	This increase is driven primarily by the earlier timing of planned product launches for the 2011 golf season compared to 2010, in addition to lower than anticipated sales on certain of the Company s older in-line golf products primarily due to the continued delay in the recovery of the golf industry in 2010.
837465_11_ITEM7_P78_S10	The Company expects to sell this inventory in the normal course of business in 2011.
837465_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity The Company s primary credit facility is a $250.0 million Line of Credit with a syndicate of eight banks under the terms of the Company s November 5, 2004 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as subsequently amended, the Line of Credit ).
837465_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	The Line of Credit expires February 15, 2012.
837465_11_ITEM7_P79_S2	The Company expects to extend its current Line of Credit or replace it with another financing facility to supplement the Company s cash flows from operations.
837465_11_ITEM7_P79_S3	The lenders in the syndicate are Bank of America, N.A., Union Bank of California, N.A., Barclays Bank, PLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., US Bank, N.A., Comerica West Incorporation, Fifth Third Bank, and Citibank, N.A.
837465_11_ITEM7_P79_S4	To date, all of the banks in the syndicate have continued to meet their commitments under the Line of Credit despite the recent turmoil in the financial markets.
837465_11_ITEM7_P79_S5	If any of the banks in the syndicate were unable to perform on their commitments to fund the Line of Credit, the Company s liquidity would be impaired, unless the Company were able to find a replacement source of funding under the Line of Credit or from other sources.
837465_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	The Line of Credit provides for revolving loans of up to $250.0 million, although actual borrowing availability can be effectively limited by the financial covenants contained therein.
837465_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	The financial covenants are tested as of the end of a fiscal quarter (i.e. on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, each year).
837465_11_ITEM7_P80_S2	So long as the Company is in compliance with the financial covenants on each of those four days, the Company has access to the full $250.0 million.
837465_11_ITEM7_P80_S3	In accordance with the Company s business seasonality, average outstanding borrowings will typically be higher during the first half of the year during the height of the golf season, and lower during the second half of the year.
837465_11_ITEM7_P80_S4	The financial covenants include a consolidated leverage ratio covenant and an interest coverage ratio covenant, both of which are based in part upon the Company s trailing four quarters earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, as well as other non-cash expense and income items as defined in the agreement governing the Line of Credit ( adjusted EBITDA ).
837465_11_ITEM7_P80_S5	The consolidated leverage ratio provides that as of the end of the quarter the Company s Consolidated Funded Indebtedness (as defined in the Line of Credit) may not exceed 2.75 times the Company s adjusted EBITDA for the previous four quarters then ended.
837465_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	then ended must be at least 3.5 times the Company s Consolidated Interest Charges (as defined in the Line of Credit) for such period.
837465_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	Many factors, including unfavorable economic conditions and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, can have a significant adverse effect upon the Company s adjusted EBITDA and therefore compliance with these financial covenants.
837465_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	If the Company were not in compliance with the financial covenants under the Line of Credit, it would not be able to borrow funds under the Line of Credit and its liquidity would be significantly adversely affected.
837465_11_ITEM7_P82_S2	Based on the Company s consolidated leverage ratio covenant and adjusted EBITDA for the four quarters ended December 31, 2010, the maximum amount of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness, including borrowings under the Line of Credit, that could have been outstanding on December 31, 2010, was $63.8 million.
837465_11_ITEM7_P82_S3	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Line of Credit and had $55.0 million of cash and cash equivalents.
837465_11_ITEM7_P82_S4	In accordance with the Company s business seasonality, average outstanding borrowings will typically be higher during the first half of the year during the height of the golf season, and lower during the second half of the year.
837465_11_ITEM7_P82_S5	Average outstanding borrowings during the first half of 2010 were $31.2 million and peaked at $69.0 million.
837465_11_ITEM7_P82_S6	Average outstanding borrowings during the second half of 2010 were $2.7 million and peaked at $17.0 million.
837465_11_ITEM7_P82_S7	As of December 31, 2010, the Company remained in compliance with the consolidated leverage ratio as well as with the interest coverage ratio covenants.
837465_11_ITEM7_P82_S8	Because the Company remained in compliance with these financial covenants, as of January 1, 2011, the Company had access to the full $250.0 million under the Line of Credit (subject to compliance with other terms of the Line of Credit).
837465_11_ITEM7_P82_S9	In addition to these financial covenants, the Line of Credit includes certain other restrictions, including restrictions limiting dividends, stock repurchases, capital expenditures and asset sales.
837465_11_ITEM7_P82_S10	As of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with these restrictions and the other terms of the Line of Credit.
837465_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	Under the Line of Credit, the Company is required to pay certain fees, including an unused commitment fee of between 10.0 to 25.0 basis points per annum of the unused commitment amount, with the exact amount determined based upon the Company s consolidated leverage ratio.
837465_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	Outstanding borrowings under the Line of Credit accrue interest, at the Company s election, based upon the Company s consolidated leverage ratio, at (i) the higher of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 50.0 basis points or (b) Bank of America s prime rate, or (ii) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the agreement governing the Line of Credit) plus a margin of 50.0 to 125.0 basis points.
837465_11_ITEM7_P83_S2	The total origination fees incurred in connection with the Line of Credit, including fees incurred in connection with the amendments to the Line of Credit, were $2.2 million and are being amortized into interest expense over the remaining term of the Line of Credit agreement.
837465_11_ITEM7_P83_S3	Unamortized origination fees were $0.3 million as of December 31, 2010, which was included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
837465_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	In November 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized it to repurchase shares of its common stock in the open market or in private transactions, subject to the Company s assessment of market conditions and buying opportunities, up to a maximum cost to the Company of $100.0 million, which would remain in effect until completed or otherwise terminated by the Board of Directors (the November 2007 repurchase program ).
837465_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	The November 2007 repurchase program supersedes all prior stock repurchase authorizations.
837465_11_ITEM7_P84_S2	During 2010, the Company repurchased approximately 88,000 shares of its common stock under the November 2007 repurchase program at an average cost per share of $8.32 for a total cost of $0.7 million.
837465_11_ITEM7_P84_S3	The Company acquired these shares to satisfy the Company s tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting and settlement of employee restricted stock unit awards.
837465_11_ITEM7_P84_S4	The Company s repurchases of shares of common stock are recorded at cost and result in a reduction of shareholders equity.
837465_11_ITEM7_P84_S5	As of December 31, 2010, the Company remained authorized to repurchase up to an additional $75.2 million of its common stock under this program.
837465_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	The following table summarizes certain significant cash obligations as of December 31, 2010 that will affect the Company s future liquidity (in millions):
837465_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	(1) During the normal course of its business, the Company enters into agreements to purchase goods and services, including purchase commitments for production materials, endorsement agreements with professional golfers and other endorsers, employment and consulting agreements, and intellectual property licensing agreements pursuant to which the Company is required to pay royalty fees.
837465_11_ITEM7_P86_S1	It is not possible to determine the amounts the Company will ultimately be required to pay under these agreements as they are subject to many variables including performance-based bonuses, reductions in payment obligations if designated minimum performance criteria are not achieved, and severance arrangements.
837465_11_ITEM7_P86_S2	The amounts listed approximate minimum purchase obligations, base compensation, and guaranteed minimum royalty payments the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements.
837465_11_ITEM7_P86_S3	The actual amounts paid under some of these agreements may be higher or lower than the amounts included.
837465_11_ITEM7_P86_S4	In the aggregate, the actual amount paid under these obligations is likely to be higher than the amounts listed as a result of the variable nature of these obligations.
837465_11_ITEM7_P86_S5	In addition, the Company also enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders or other documentation or that are undocumented except for an invoice.
837465_11_ITEM7_P86_S6	Such unconditional purchase obligations are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected in this line item.
837465_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	(2) The Company may elect, on or prior to June 15, 2012, to mandatorily convert some or all of the preferred stock into shares of the Company s common stock if the closing price of the Company s common stock has exceeded 150% of the conversion price for at least 20 of the 30 consecutive trading days ending the day before the Company sends the notice of mandatory conversion.
837465_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	Given these factors, if the Company elects to mandatorily convert any preferred stock, it will make a payment on the preferred stock equal to the aggregate amount of dividends that would have accrued and become payable through and including June 15, 2012, less any dividends already paid on preferred stock (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Preferred Stock Offering in this Form 10-K).
837465_11_ITEM7_P87_S2	The amounts included in the table above represent the Company s total commitment to pay preferred dividends through June 15, 2012 should it opt to mandatorily convert any preferred stock.
837465_11_ITEM7_P87_S3	However, if the preferred stock were to remain outstanding subsequent to June 15, 2012, the Company would be required to continue to pay dividends subject to the terms and conditions of the preferred stock.
837465_11_ITEM7_P87_S4	These additional dividends are not reflected in this table.
837465_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	(3) The Company leases certain warehouse, distribution and office facilities, vehicles and office equipment under operating leases.
837465_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	The amounts presented in this line item represent commitments for minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases.
837465_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	(4) Amount represents total uncertain income tax positions pursuant to the adoption of ASC Topic 740-25-6.
837465_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	For further discussion see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Income Taxes in this Form 10-K. During its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions.
837465_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	and/or license of Company products or trademarks, (ii) indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facilities or leases, (iii) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to the goods or services provided to the Company or based on the negligence or willful misconduct of the Company and (iv) indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts.
837465_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	In addition, the Company has made contractual commitments to each of its officers and certain other employees providing for severance payments upon the termination of employment.
837465_11_ITEM7_P90_S2	The Company also has consulting agreements that provide for payment of nominal fees upon the issuance of patents and/or the commercialization of research results.
837465_11_ITEM7_P90_S3	The Company has also issued guarantees in the form of a standby letter of credit as security for contingent liabilities under certain workers compensation insurance policies.
837465_11_ITEM7_P90_S4	In addition, in connection with the uPlay asset acquisition, the Company could be required to pay an additional purchase price of up to $10.0 million based on a percentage of earnings generated from the sale of uPlay products over a period of three years ending on December 31, 2011 (see Note 7 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
837465_11_ITEM7_P90_S5	As of December 31, 2010, based on the Company s preliminary assessment of certain performance indicators in connection with the sale of uPlay products, the probability of the Company fulfilling this additional purchase price obligation at the end of the three year period ending December 31, 2011, is remote.
837465_11_ITEM7_P90_S6	The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases may be indefinite.
837465_11_ITEM7_P90_S7	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be obligated to make.
837465_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	Historically, costs incurred to settle claims related to indemnities have not been material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	In addition, the Company believes the likelihood is remote that payments under the commitments and guarantees described above will have a material effect on the Company s financial condition.
837465_11_ITEM7_P91_S2	The fair value of indemnities, commitments and guarantees that the Company issued during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 was not material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_11_ITEM7_P91_S3	In addition to the contractual obligations listed above, the Company s liquidity could also be adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome with respect to claims and litigation that the Company is subject to from time to time.
837465_11_ITEM7_P91_S4	See Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
837465_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	Sufficiency of Liquidity Based upon its current operating plan, analysis of its consolidated financial position and projected future results of operations, the Company believes that its operating cash flows, together with its current or future credit facilities, will be sufficient to finance current operating requirements, planned capital expenditures, contractual obligations and commercial commitments, for at least the next 12 months.
837465_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	There can be no assurance, however, that future industry-specific or other developments (including noncompliance with the financial covenants under its Line of Credit), general economic trends, foreign currency exchange rates, or other matters will not adversely affect the Company s operations or its ability to meet its future cash requirements (see above, Sources of Liquidity and Certain Factors Affecting Callaway Golf Company contained in Item 1A).
837465_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	Capital Resources The Company does not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures.
837465_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	At December 31, 2010, the Company had total outstanding commitments on non-cancelable operating leases of approximately $39.6 million related to certain warehouse, distribution and office facilities, vehicles as well as office equipment.
837465_11_ITEM7_P93_S2	Lease terms range from 1 to 8 years expiring at various dates through February 2018, with options to renew at varying terms.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes to limit its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Transactions involving these financial instruments are with creditworthy banks, including the banks that are parties to the Company s Line of Credit (see Note 10 Financing Arrangements to the Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements).
837465_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The use of these instruments exposes the Company to market and credit risk which may at times be concentrated with certain counterparties, although counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk from its Line of Credit.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P0_S4	In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions of its international subsidiaries, including certain balance sheet exposures (payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies) (see Note 11 Derivatives and Hedging to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
837465_11_ITEM7A_P0_S5	In addition, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from the translation of the operating results of the Company s international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	As part of its strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts and put and call option contracts ( foreign currency exchange contracts ) to hedge transactions that are denominated primarily in British Pounds, Euros, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Korean Won.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	For most currencies, the Company is a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefits from a weaker U.S. dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which the Company transacts significant amounts of business.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Foreign currency exchange contracts are used only to meet the Company s objectives of offsetting gains and losses from foreign currency exchange exposures with gains and losses from the contracts used to hedge them in order to reduce volatility of earnings.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P1_S3	The extent to which the Company s hedging activities mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates varies based upon many factors, including the amount of transactions being hedged.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P1_S4	The Company generally only hedges a limited portion of its international transactions.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Foreign currency rates for financial reporting purposes had a significant positive impact upon the Company s consolidated reported financial results in 2010 compared to 2009 (see above, Certain Factors Affecting Callaway Golf Company contained in Item 1A and Results of Operations contained in Item 7).
837465_11_ITEM7A_P1_S6	The Company does not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for speculative purposes.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P1_S7	Foreign currency exchange contracts generally mature within twelve months from their inception.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P1_S8	The Company does not designate foreign currency exchange contracts as derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P1_S9	As such, changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized in earnings in the period of change.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the notional amounts of the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts used to hedge the exposures discussed above were approximately $314.2 million, $101.7 million and $23.7 million, respectively.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no outstanding foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for anticipated sales denominated in foreign currencies.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	As part of the Company s risk management procedure, a sensitivity analysis model is used to measure the potential loss in future earnings of market-sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates or foreign currency values.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The sensitivity analysis model quantifies the estimated potential effect of unfavorable movements of 10% in foreign currencies to which the Company was exposed at December 31, 2010 through its foreign currency exchange contracts.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The estimated maximum one-day loss from the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts, calculated using the sensitivity analysis model described above, is $33.6 million at December 31, 2010.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities is $33.6 million at December 31, 2010 and would impact earnings.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The Company believes that such a hypothetical loss from its foreign currency exchange contracts would be partially offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The sensitivity analysis model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in earnings that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P5_S1	It also does not represent the maximum possible loss that may occur.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The Company is exposed to interest rate risk from its Line of Credit (see Note 10 Financing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
837465_11_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Outstanding borrowings under the Line of Credit accrue interest at the Company s election, based upon the Company s consolidated leverage ratio and trailing four quarters EBITDA, of (i) the higher of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 50.0 basis points or (b) Bank of America s prime rate, or (ii) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the agreement governing the Line of Credit) plus a margin of 50.0 to 125.0 basis points.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P7_S0	As part of the Company s risk management procedures, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of unfavorable changes in interest rates on the Company s cash flows.
837465_11_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The sensitivity analysis quantified that the incremental expense incurred by an increase of 10% in interest rates would be nominal over a twelve month period.

837465_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
837465_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act).
837465_11_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.
837465_11_ITEM9A_P1_S3	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in its report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework.
837465_11_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Based on that assessment, management concluded that as of December 31, 2010, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the COSO criteria.
837465_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting .
837465_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2010, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
837465_11_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
837465_11_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
837465_11_ITEM9A_P2_S4	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.

837465_11_ITEM9B_P0_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

837465_11_ITEM9B_P1_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

837465_11_ITEM15_P27_S0	ASU 2009-17 changed how a reporting entity determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated.
837465_11_ITEM15_P27_S1	The determination of whether a reporting entity is required to consolidate another entity is based on, among other things, the other entity s purpose and design and the reporting entity s ability to direct the activities of the other entity that most significantly impact the other entity s economic performance.
837465_11_ITEM15_P27_S2	This standard requires a number of new disclosures, including additional disclosures about the reporting entity s involvement with variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement.

837465_11_ITEM15_P31_S3	The amendments in this ASU also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable.
837465_11_ITEM15_P31_S4	Significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor s multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, including information about the nature and terms, significant deliverables, and its performance within arrangements.
837465_11_ITEM15_P31_S5	The amendments also require providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling-price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition.
837465_11_ITEM15_P31_S6	The amendments in this ASU are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.

837465_11_ITEM15_P32_S2	The new guidance will include factors to help companies determine what software elements are considered essential to the functionality.
837465_11_ITEM15_P32_S3	The amendments will now subject software-enabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements, such as guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple-deliverables.
837465_11_ITEM15_P32_S4	The amendments in this ASU are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
837465_11_ITEM15_P32_S5	Based on the Company s evaluation of this ASU, the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

837465_11_ITEM15_P36_S1	In addition, the Company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws.
837465_11_ITEM15_P36_S2	The Company s gift cards have no expiration.
837465_11_ITEM15_P37_S0	To determine when redemption is remote, the Company analyzes an aging of unredeemed cards (based on the date the card was last used or the activation date if the card has never been used) and compares that information with historical redemption trends.

837465_11_ITEM15_P40_S2	In estimating its future warranty obligations, the Company considers various relevant factors, including the Company s stated warranty policies and practices, the historical frequency of claims, and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty.
837465_11_ITEM15_P40_S3	The decrease in the estimated future warranty obligation is primarily due to a decline in sales and in warranty return rates primarily due to improved durability of newer products combined with an increase in customer paid repairs.
837465_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to the Company s reserve for warranty expense: Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and payables, forward foreign currency exchange and option contracts (see Note 11) and its financing arrangements (see Note 10).
837465_11_ITEM15_P41_S1	The carrying amounts of these instruments approximate fair value because of their short-term maturities and variable interest rates.
837465_11_ITEM15_P41_S2	In addition, through October 1, 2009, the Company had a Company-owned life insurance policy in order to support a deferred compensation plan that was offered to certain employees.

837465_11_ITEM15_P46_S1	The derivative instruments are accounted for pursuant to ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, measure those instruments at fair value and recognize changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change unless the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge that offsets certain exposures.
837465_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less.
837465_11_ITEM15_P47_S1	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments.

837465_11_ITEM15_P56_S1	An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.
837465_11_ITEM15_P56_S2	The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group.
837465_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets consist of goodwill, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, patents and other intangible assets acquired during the acquisition of Odyssey Sports, Inc., the Top-Flite assets, FrogTrader, Inc., the Tour Golf Group assets, the uPlay, LLC assets and certain foreign distributors.
837465_11_ITEM15_P57_S1	In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists.
837465_11_ITEM15_P57_S2	The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets over their estimated fair value.
837465_11_ITEM15_P57_S3	If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded.
837465_11_ITEM15_P58_S0	To determine fair value, the Company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals when appropriate.

837465_11_ITEM15_P59_S1	As a result, the Company identified a pre-tax impairment charge of $7,547,000 related to trade names, trademarks and other intangible assets the Company acquired in 2003 as part of the acquisition of the assets of TFGC Estate, Inc. (f/k/a the Top-Flite Golf Company) (see Note 9).
837465_11_ITEM15_P60_S0	Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-05 discussed above.
837465_11_ITEM15_P60_S1	See Note 9 for further discussion of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets.
837465_11_ITEM15_P61_S0	Investments The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of acquisition and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date.
837465_11_ITEM15_P61_S1	Investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are stated at cost and are reported in other assets.

837465_11_ITEM15_P62_S0	The Company accounts for its share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ( ASC Topic 718 ), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values.
837465_11_ITEM15_P62_S1	ASC Topic 718 further requires a reduction in share-based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_11_ITEM15_P63_S0	The forfeiture rate used by the Company is based on historical forfeiture trends.
837465_11_ITEM15_P63_S1	If actual forfeiture rates are not consistent with the Company s estimates, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods.
837465_11_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant.
837465_11_ITEM15_P65_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions to calculate the value of stock options.
837465_11_ITEM15_P65_S1	The Company uses historical data among other information to estimate the expected price volatility, option life, dividend yield and forfeiture rate.
837465_11_ITEM15_P65_S2	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option.

837465_11_ITEM15_P67_S1	The estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the award date multiplied by the number of shares underlying the restricted stock awarded.
837465_11_ITEM15_P67_S2	Total compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
837465_11_ITEM15_P68_S0	Phantom Stock Units are a form of share-based awards that are indexed to the Company s stock and are settled in cash.
837465_11_ITEM15_P68_S1	They are accounted for as liabilities, which are initially measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant.
837465_11_ITEM15_P68_S2	The estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the award date multiplied by the number of shares underlying the phantom stock awarded.
837465_11_ITEM15_P68_S3	The liabilities are subsequently remeasured based on the fair value of the awards at the end of each interim reporting period through the settlement date of the awards.
837465_11_ITEM15_P69_S0	Total compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
837465_11_ITEM15_P70_S0	Income Taxes Current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year.
837465_11_ITEM15_P71_S0	A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to ASC Topic 740 and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
837465_11_ITEM15_P71_S1	The Company provides a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
837465_11_ITEM15_P71_S2	In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.
837465_11_ITEM15_P71_S3	These assessments require significant judgment about future financial forecasts that are required to be consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying business.
837465_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	In the event the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
837465_11_ITEM15_P72_S1	Likewise, should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be a charge to income in the period such determination was made.
837465_11_ITEM15_P73_S0	Pursuant to ASC Topic 740-25-6, the Company is required to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to pay such additional taxes.

837465_11_ITEM15_P74_S0	The Company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions.
837465_11_ITEM15_P74_S1	The preparation of these income tax returns requires the Company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by the Company.
837465_11_ITEM15_P74_S2	As required under applicable accounting rules, the Company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability, including interest and penalties, for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return.
837465_11_ITEM15_P74_S3	The Company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available.
837465_11_ITEM15_P75_S0	Historically, additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the Company s uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the Company s expectations.
837465_11_ITEM15_P75_S1	For further information, see Note 16 Income Taxes.

837465_11_ITEM15_P78_S0	Diversification of Credit Risk The Company s financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, trade receivables and foreign currency exchange contracts.
837465_11_ITEM15_P78_S1	The Company historically invests its excess cash in money market accounts and short-term U.S. government securities and has established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities in an effort to maintain safety and liquidity.
837465_11_ITEM15_P78_S2	These guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of trends in yields and interest rates.
837465_11_ITEM15_P79_S0	The Company operates in the golf equipment industry and primarily sells its products to golf equipment retailers (including pro shops at golf courses and off-course retailers), sporting goods retailers and mass merchants, directly and through wholly-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries, and to foreign distributors.

837465_11_ITEM15_P81_S0	From time to time, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and put or call options for the purpose of hedging foreign exchange rate exposures on existing or anticipated transactions.
837465_11_ITEM15_P81_S1	In the event of a failure to honor one of these contracts by one of the banks with which the Company has contracted, management believes any loss would be limited to the exchange rate differential from the time the contract was made until the time it was settled.
837465_11_ITEM15_P82_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company began the implementation of certain gross margin improvement initiatives.
837465_11_ITEM15_P82_S1	Since its inception and through the end of 2009, these initiatives primarily consisted of process improvements in the procurement of direct materials, including all components used in finished products, and the procurement of indirect goods and services as well as value engineering and automation to create efficiencies within the Company s operational areas.
837465_11_ITEM15_P82_S2	In 2010, the Company began the implementation of the next phase of the gross margin improvement initiatives, which (as discussed below) targets the Company s manufacturing and distribution processes including streamlining the process in which the Company distributes components and finished goods worldwide (the Global Operations Strategy ).
837465_11_ITEM15_P82_S3	The Company expects to continue implementing this phase of the gross margin improvement initiatives through 2011.
837465_11_ITEM15_P83_S0	During the third quarter of 2010, as part of the Company s Global Operations Strategy, the Company announced the restructuring of its golf club and golf ball manufacturing and distribution operations.
837465_11_ITEM15_P83_S1	This restructuring, which is designed to add speed and flexibility to customer service demands, optimize efficiencies, and facilitate long-term gross margin improvements, includes the reorganization of the Company s manufacturing and distribution centers located in Carlsbad, California, Toronto, Canada, and Chicopee, Massachusetts, the creation of third-party logistics sites in Dallas, Texas and Toronto, Canada, as well as the establishment of a new production facility in Monterrey, Mexico.
837465_11_ITEM15_P83_S2	It is estimated that the restructuring will take approximately 18 months to complete from the time of its announcement.
837465_11_ITEM15_P84_S0	The Company intends to maintain limited manufacturing and distribution facilities in Carlsbad, California and Chicopee, Massachusetts.
837465_11_ITEM15_P84_S1	As a result of this restructuring, the Company has recognized and will recognize non-cash charges for the acceleration of depreciation on certain golf club and golf ball manufacturing equipment and cash charges related to severance benefits and transition costs, which consist primarily of consulting expenses, costs associated with redundancies during the start-up and training phase of the new production facility in Monterrey, Mexico, start-up costs associated with the establishment of third-party logistics sites, travel expenses, and costs associated with the transfer of inventory and equipment.
837465_11_ITEM15_P84_S2	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $14,816,000 in connection with this restructuring, of which $12,827,000 and $1,989,000 was recognized within cost of goods sold and general and administrative expenses, respectively, and of which $12,065,000 and $762,000 was absorbed by the Company s golf clubs and golf balls segments, respectively.
837465_11_ITEM15_P84_S3	Charges related to corporate general and administrative expenses were excluded from the Company s operating segments.
837465_11_ITEM15_P84_S4	The Company currently estimates that the total costs related to this restructuring will be approximately $35,000,000-$40,000,000, including the amounts recognized during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010.
837465_11_ITEM15_P84_S5	As of December 31, 2010, the total future estimated charges are $23,000,000, of which approximately $20,000,000 will be settled in cash and approximately $3,000,000 will be non-cash charges, and $17,000,000 and $6,000,000 will be absorbed by the golf clubs and golf balls segments, respectively.
837465_11_ITEM15_P84_S6	These estimated charges reflect the Company s best estimate as of the filing of this report based upon the Company s current plans.
837465_11_ITEM15_P84_S7	Any change in the Company s plans during implementation, or any delays, difficulties, or change in costs associated with the implementation of these initiatives, could affect the estimated amounts or timing of the charges.

837465_11_ITEM15_P85_S1	Amounts payable as of December 31, 2010 were included within accounts payable and accrued expenses, and accrued employee compensation and benefits on the Company s consolidated balance sheet.
837465_11_ITEM15_P86_S0	In connection with the Company s gross margin improvement initiatives and its actions to improve the profitability of its golf ball business, the Company has taken actions to consolidate its golf ball operations into other existing locations.
837465_11_ITEM15_P86_S1	As a result of these initiatives, in May 2008, the Company announced the closure of its golf ball manufacturing facility in Gloversville, New York.
837465_11_ITEM15_P86_S2	This closure resulted in the recognition of non-cash charges for the write-down of the manufacturing facility to its fair value and the acceleration of depreciation on certain golf ball manufacturing equipment, and cash charges related to severance benefits and facility costs.
837465_11_ITEM15_P86_S3	In the aggregate through December 31, 2010, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $5,031,000 in connection with the closure of this facility.

837465_11_ITEM15_P89_S2	Based on the initial conversion rate, approximately 19,900,000 shares of common stock would be issuable upon conversion of all of the outstanding shares of preferred stock.
837465_11_ITEM15_P89_S3	The Company may also elect, on or prior to June 15, 2012, to mandatorily convert some or all of the preferred stock into shares of the Company s common stock if the closing price of the Company s common stock has exceeded 150% of the conversion price for at least 20 of the 30 consecutive trading days ending the day before the Company sends the notice of mandatory conversion.
837465_11_ITEM15_P89_S4	If the Company elects to mandatorily convert any preferred stock, it will make an additional payment on the preferred stock equal to the aggregate amount of dividends that would have accrued and become payable through and including June 15, 2012, less any dividends already paid on the preferred stock.
837465_11_ITEM15_P89_S5	As of December 31, 2010, this amount would have been $15,313,000.

837465_11_ITEM15_P90_S1	The Company accounted for this investment in accordance with ASC Topic 325, Investments Other using the cost method, as the Company owned less than a 20% interest in GEI and did not have the ability to significantly influence the operating and financial policies of GEI.
837465_11_ITEM15_P90_S2	Accordingly, this investment was recorded at cost and is included in other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.
837465_11_ITEM15_P90_S3	In addition, the Company and GEI entered into a Preferred Partner Agreement under which the Company is granted preferred signage rights, rights as the preferred supplier of golf products used or offered for use at TopGolf facilities at prices no less than those paid by the Company s customers, preferred retail positioning in the TopGolf retail stores, access to consumer information obtained by TopGolf, and other rights incidental to those listed.

837465_11_ITEM15_P92_S1	The table below summarizes the principal amounts under the loans as well as accrued interest and fees as of December 31, 2010 (in thousands).
837465_11_ITEM15_P92_S2	The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of this investment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of this investment may not be fully recoverable or exceeds its fair value.
837465_11_ITEM15_P93_S0	Late in the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company was informed that third party investors would be making a significant investment in GEI to fund GEI s site expansion and for other working capital purposes.
837465_11_ITEM15_P93_S1	The Company was also informed that the reincorporation of GEI from the United Kingdom to the United States would be completed in early January 2011.
837465_11_ITEM15_P93_S2	In connection with these transactions, the Company agreed to the conversion of all shareholder loans into preferred stock in early January 2011 and consequently, the Company received full value for the principal and accrued fees and interest in the form of additional preferred stock of GEI.
837465_11_ITEM15_P93_S3	As a result, the Company, with the assistance of an external valuation firm, conducted a valuation analysis of the Company s investment in GEI assuming the loans were converted into preferred stock.
837465_11_ITEM15_P93_S4	The valuation consisted of a market approach model as well as a discounted cash flow model.
837465_11_ITEM15_P93_S5	The valuation analysis was completed in January 2011, (following the third party investments, the reincorporation, and the loan conversions) and concluded that the fair value of the Company s investment in GEI with all loans converted into preferred stock exceeded the carrying value of the Company s investment.
837465_11_ITEM15_P93_S6	The Company will continue to monitor the recoverability of this investment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or exceeds its fair value.
837465_11_ITEM15_P94_S0	Following the additional investments and the loan conversions, the Company s percentage ownership decreased in TopGolf International, Inc. (successor-in-interest to Golf Entertainment International Limited).
837465_11_ITEM15_P94_S1	As such, the Company will continue to account for its investment using the cost method under ASC Topic 325.
837465_11_ITEM15_P95_S0	In addition to the investment and loans referenced above, in April 2010 the Company entered into an arrangement to provide collateral in the form of a letter of credit up to $8,000,000 for a loan that was issued to GEI.
837465_11_ITEM15_P95_S1	The Company did not renew this letter of credit, which expired in February 2011.

837465_11_ITEM15_P99_S1	The Company acquired uPlay in order to form synergies from co-branding these products with the Callaway Golf brand, promote the global distribution of these products through the Company s existing sales force and create incremental new business opportunities.
837465_11_ITEM15_P99_S2	Under SFAS No. 141, the estimated aggregate cost of the acquired assets was $11,377,000, which includes cash paid of $9,880,000, transaction costs of $204,000, and assumed liabilities of $1,293,000.
837465_11_ITEM15_P99_S3	The aggregate acquisition costs exceeded the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired.
837465_11_ITEM15_P99_S4	As a result, the Company has recorded goodwill of $629,000, none of which is deductible for tax purposes.
837465_11_ITEM15_P99_S5	The Company has recorded the fair values of uPlay s database and technology, trademarks and trade names, and non-compete agreements in the amounts of $7,900,000, $540,000 and $760,000, respectively, using an income valuation approach.
837465_11_ITEM15_P99_S6	This valuation technique provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on the cash flows that the asset can be expected to generate over its remaining useful life.
837465_11_ITEM15_P99_S7	These intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 4 to 8 years.
837465_11_ITEM15_P100_S0	In connection with this purchase, the Company could be required to pay an additional purchase price not to exceed $10,000,000 based on a percentage of earnings generated from the sale of uPlay products over a period of three years ending on December 31, 2011.
837465_11_ITEM15_P100_S1	As of December 31, 2010, based on the Company s preliminary assessment of certain performance indicators in connection with the sale of uPlay products, the probability of the Company fulfilling this additional purchase price obligation at the end of the three year period ending December 31, 2011, is remote.
837465_11_ITEM15_P100_S2	However, in the event that a portion of this obligation is met, any such additional purchase price paid at the end of the three year period will be recorded as goodwill.
837465_11_ITEM15_P100_S3	The allocation of the aggregate acquisition costs is as follows (in thousands): The pro-forma effects of the uPlay, LLC asset acquisition would not have been material to the Company s results of operations for fiscal 2008 and, therefore, are not presented.

837465_11_ITEM15_P102_S1	The following sets forth the intangible assets by major asset class: The increase in other amortizing intangibles is related to the acquisition of amortizing trademarks.
837465_11_ITEM15_P102_S2	Aggregate amortization expense on intangible assets was approximately $4,181,000, $4,261,000 and $3,203,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
837465_11_ITEM15_P102_S3	Amortization expense related to intangible assets at December 31, 2010 in each of the next five fiscal years and beyond is expected to be incurred as follows (in thousands): The Company performs an impairment analysis on its goodwill and intangible assets at least annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be fully recoverable.
837465_11_ITEM15_P103_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company conducted its annual impairment test on its goodwill and intangible assets, including the trade names, trademarks and other intangible assets the Company acquired in 2003 as part of the Top-Flite acquisition.
837465_11_ITEM15_P103_S1	The current fair value of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets was calculated by taking the expected future cash flows of those assets over their estimated useful lives and discounting the cash flows based upon an appropriate discount rate.
837465_11_ITEM15_P103_S2	The discounted cash flow analysis was based upon reasonable assumptions relating to the Company s intangible assets such as (i) forecasted sales, (ii) estimated royalty rates, (iii) estimated growth rates, and (iv) the discount rate.
837465_11_ITEM15_P104_S0	In calculating the expected future cash flows from the trade names and trademarks acquired as part of the Top-Flite acquisition, the Company considered the negative impact of a recent trend in the golf industry where premium branded competitor golf balls are now being sold through the sporting goods and mass market channels.
837465_11_ITEM15_P104_S1	This increase in premium branded balls in these retail channels over the past couple of years has negatively impacted sales of Top-Flite branded golf balls.
837465_11_ITEM15_P105_S0	In completing the impairment analysis, the Company determined that the discounted expected cash flows from the trade names and trademarks associated with the Top-Flite acquisition was $7,547,000 less than the carrying value of those assets.
837465_11_ITEM15_P105_S1	As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $7,547,000 during the fourth quarter of 2010, which was reflected in the accompanying Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2010.
837465_11_ITEM15_P105_S2	Goodwill additions during the year ended December 31, 2009 consisted of approximately $268,000, as a result of adjustments in connection with the uPlay asset acquisition.
837465_11_ITEM15_P105_S3	There were no goodwill additions during 2010.
837465_11_ITEM15_P105_S4	In addition, the goodwill balance decreased by $482,000 at December 31, 2010 and increased by $1,101,000 at December 31, 2009 as a result of the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments on goodwill balances held in foreign currencies.
837465_11_ITEM15_P106_S0	Financing Arrangements The Company s primary credit facility is a $250,000,000 Line of Credit with a syndicate of eight banks under the terms of the Company s November 5, 2004 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as subsequently amended, the Line of Credit ).
837465_11_ITEM15_P106_S1	The Line of Credit expires February 15, 2012.
837465_11_ITEM15_P106_S2	The Company expects to extend its current Line of Credit or replace it with another financing facility to supplement the Company s cash flows from operations.
837465_11_ITEM15_P106_S3	The lenders in the syndicate are Bank of America, N.A., Union Bank of California, N.A., Barclays Bank, PLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., US Bank, N.A., Comerica West Incorporation, Fifth Third Bank, and Citibank, N.A.
837465_11_ITEM15_P106_S4	To date, all of the banks in the syndicate have continued to meet their commitments under the Line of Credit despite the recent turmoil in the financial markets.
837465_11_ITEM15_P106_S5	If any of the banks in the syndicate were unable to perform on their commitments to fund the Line of Credit, the Company s liquidity would be impaired, unless the Company were able to find a replacement source of funding under the Line of Credit or from other sources.
837465_11_ITEM15_P107_S0	The Line of Credit provides for revolving loans of up to $250,000,000, although actual borrowing availability can be effectively limited by the financial covenants contained therein.
837465_11_ITEM15_P107_S1	The financial covenants are tested as of the end of a fiscal quarter (i.e. on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, each year).
837465_11_ITEM15_P107_S2	So long as the Company is in compliance with the financial covenants on each of those four days, the Company has access to the full $250,000,000.
837465_11_ITEM15_P107_S3	The financial covenants include a consolidated leverage ratio covenant and an interest coverage ratio covenant, both of which are based in part upon the Company s trailing four quarters earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, as well as other non-cash expense and income items as defined in the agreement governing the Line of Credit ( adjusted EBITDA ).
837465_11_ITEM15_P107_S4	The consolidated leverage ratio provides that as of the end of the quarter the Company s Consolidated Funded Indebtedness (as defined in the Line of Credit) may not exceed 2.75 times the Company s adjusted EBITDA for the previous four quarters then ended.
837465_11_ITEM15_P107_S5	The interest coverage ratio covenant provides that the Company s adjusted EBITDA for the previous four quarters then ended must be at least 3.50 times the Company s Consolidated Interest Charges (as defined in the Line of Credit) for such period.
837465_11_ITEM15_P107_S6	Many factors, including unfavorable economic conditions and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, can have a significant adverse effect upon the Company s adjusted EBITDA and therefore compliance with these financial covenants.
837465_11_ITEM15_P107_S7	If the Company were not in compliance with the financial covenants under the Line of Credit, it would not be able to borrow funds under the Line of Credit and its liquidity would be significantly affected.
837465_11_ITEM15_P107_S8	Based on the Company s consolidated leverage ratio covenant and adjusted EBITDA for the four quarters ended December 31, 2010, the maximum amount of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness, including borrowings under the Line of Credit, that could have been outstanding on December 31, 2010, was approximately $63,775,000.
837465_11_ITEM15_P108_S0	and had $55,043,000 of cash and cash equivalents.
837465_11_ITEM15_P108_S1	In accordance with the Company s business seasonality, average outstanding borrowings will typically be higher during the first half of the year during the height of the golf season, and lower during the second half of the year.
837465_11_ITEM15_P108_S2	Average outstanding borrowings during the first half of 2010 were $31,211,000 and peaked at $69,000,000.
837465_11_ITEM15_P108_S3	Average outstanding borrowings during the second half of 2010 were $2,679,000 and peaked at $17,000,000.
837465_11_ITEM15_P108_S4	As of December 31, 2010, the Company remained in compliance with the consolidated leverage ratio as well as with the interest coverage ratio covenants.
837465_11_ITEM15_P108_S5	Because the Company remained in compliance with these financial covenants, as of January 1, 2011, the Company had access to the full $250,000,000 under the Line of Credit (subject to compliance with other terms of the Line of Credit).
837465_11_ITEM15_P108_S6	In addition to these financial covenants, the Line of Credit includes certain other restrictions, including restrictions limiting dividends, stock repurchases, capital expenditures and asset sales.
837465_11_ITEM15_P108_S7	As of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with these restrictions and the other terms of the Line of Credit.
837465_11_ITEM15_P109_S0	Under the Line of Credit, the Company is required to pay certain fees, including an unused commitment fee of between 10.0 to 25.0 basis points per annum of the unused commitment amount, with the exact amount determined based upon the Company s consolidated leverage ratio.
837465_11_ITEM15_P109_S1	Outstanding borrowings under the Line of Credit accrue interest, at the Company s election, based upon the Company s consolidated leverage ratio, at (i) the higher of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 50.0 basis points or (b) Bank of America s prime rate, or (ii) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the agreement governing the Line of Credit) plus a margin of 50.0 to 125.0 basis points.
837465_11_ITEM15_P109_S2	The total origination fees incurred in connection with the Line of Credit, including fees incurred in connection with the amendments to the Line of Credit, were $2,250,000 and are being amortized into interest expense over the remaining term of the Line of Credit agreement.
837465_11_ITEM15_P109_S3	Unamortized origination fees were $338,000 as of December 31, 2010, of which $315,000 was included in other current assets and $23,000 in other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
837465_11_ITEM15_P110_S0	Derivatives and Hedging Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts The Company accounts for its foreign currency exchange contracts in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ( ASC 815 ).
837465_11_ITEM15_P110_S1	ASC 815 requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, the measurement of those instruments at fair value and the recognition of changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change, unless the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge that offsets certain exposures.
837465_11_ITEM15_P110_S2	In addition, it requires enhanced disclosures regarding derivative instruments and hedging activities to better convey the purpose of derivative use in terms of the risks the Company is intending to manage, specifically about (a) how and why the Company uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under ASC 815, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the Company s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows.
837465_11_ITEM15_P111_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions of its international subsidiaries, including certain balance sheet exposures (payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies).
837465_11_ITEM15_P111_S1	In addition, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from the translation of the operating results of the Company s international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.
837465_11_ITEM15_P112_S0	As part of its strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts and put and call option contracts ( foreign currency exchange contracts ) to hedge transactions that are denominated primarily in British Pounds, Euros, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Korean Won.
837465_11_ITEM15_P113_S0	The Company does not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for speculative purposes.
837465_11_ITEM15_P113_S1	Foreign currency exchange contracts usually mature within twelve months from their inception.
837465_11_ITEM15_P113_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company did not designate any foreign currency exchange contracts as derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting under ASC 815.
837465_11_ITEM15_P113_S3	At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the notional amounts of the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts used to hedge the exposures discussed above were approximately $314,190,000, $101,723,000 and $23,742,000, respectively.
837465_11_ITEM15_P114_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company began hedging the translation of certain revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies.
837465_11_ITEM15_P114_S1	As a result, the notional amounts of the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 include $217,770,000 and $80,167,000, respectively, relating to exposures in operating results from revenues and expenses of the Company s international subsidiaries.
837465_11_ITEM15_P115_S0	The Company estimates the fair values of foreign currency exchange contracts based on pricing models using current market rates, and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the statement of operations.
837465_11_ITEM15_P115_S1	The following table summarizes the fair value of derivative instruments by contract type as well as the location of the asset and/or liability on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):
837465_11_ITEM15_P116_S0	$ The following table summarizes the location of gains and losses on the consolidated statements of operations that were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in addition to the derivative contract type (in thousands):
837465_11_ITEM15_P117_S0	The net realized and unrealized contractual net losses noted in the table above for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were used by the Company to offset actual foreign currency transactional net gains associated with assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as well as net gains associated with the translation of foreign currencies in operating results.
837465_11_ITEM15_P118_S0	Supply of Electricity and Energy Contracts The Company previously had an energy supply contract, which the Company accounted for as a derivative instrument.
837465_11_ITEM15_P118_S1	The Company terminated this contract in 2001, and upon termination, the contract ceased to be a derivative instrument.
837465_11_ITEM15_P118_S2	At the time of termination, the Company did not meet the criteria to extinguish the $19,922,000 unrealized loss liability associated with the derivative instrument.
837465_11_ITEM15_P119_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company, in consultation with its outside advisors, determined that the Company had met the criteria under ASC 405-20 and therefore reversed the derivative liability.
837465_11_ITEM15_P119_S1	As a result, the Company recorded in other income in the fourth quarter of 2008, a $19,922,000 non-cash, non-operational benefit.
837465_11_ITEM15_P120_S0	Earnings (Loss) per Common Share Earnings (loss) per common share, basic, is computed by dividing net income (loss) allocable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
837465_11_ITEM15_P120_S1	Earnings (loss) per common share, diluted, is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common and potentially dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding for the period.
837465_11_ITEM15_P120_S2	Weighted-average common shares outstanding diluted is the same as weighted-average common shares outstanding basic in periods when a net loss is reported, or in periods when diluted earnings (loss) per share is more favorable than basic earnings (loss) per share.
837465_11_ITEM15_P121_S0	Dilutive securities include the common stock equivalents of convertible preferred stock, options granted pursuant to the Company s stock option plans, potential shares related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ) and outstanding restricted stock awards and units granted to employees and non-employees (see Note 14).
837465_11_ITEM15_P121_S1	Dilutive securities are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share using the treasury stock method in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share ( ASC 260 ).
837465_11_ITEM15_P121_S2	Dilutive securities related to the ESPP are calculated by dividing the average withholdings during the period by 85% of the market value of the Company s common stock at the end of the period.
837465_11_ITEM15_P122_S0	In June 2009, the Company completed its offering of 1,400,000 shares of convertible preferred stock.
837465_11_ITEM15_P122_S1	The preferred stock is generally convertible into shares of common stock and earns cumulative dividends from the date of original issue at an initial rate of 7.50% per annum.
837465_11_ITEM15_P122_S2	In accordance with ASC 260, dividends on cumulative preferred stock are subtracted from net income (loss) to calculate net income (loss) allocable to common shareholders in the basic earnings (loss) per share calculation.
837465_11_ITEM15_P122_S3	As of December 31, 2010, the Company paid $10,500,000 in dividends to preferred shareholders and accrued $438,000.
837465_11_ITEM15_P123_S0	The following table summarizes the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock, and reconciles the weighted-average common shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share:
837465_11_ITEM15_P124_S0	Options with an exercise price in excess of the average market value of the Company s common stock during the period have been excluded from the calculation as their effect would be antidilutive.
837465_11_ITEM15_P125_S0	ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, options outstanding totaling approximately 9,873,000, 8,932,000 and 5,702,000 shares, respectively, were excluded from the calculations as their effect would have been antidilutive.
837465_11_ITEM15_P125_S1	Additionally, potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation in periods in which a net loss is reported as their effect would be antidilutive, including weighted average common stock equivalents of 19,858,000 and 10,747,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to convertible preferred shares outstanding.
837465_11_ITEM15_P125_S2	There were no convertible preferred shares outstanding in 2008.
837465_11_ITEM15_P126_S0	Capital Stock Common Stock and Preferred Stock The Company has an authorized capital of 243,000,000 shares, $0.01 par value, of which 240,000,000 shares are designated common stock, and 3,000,000 shares are designated preferred stock.
837465_11_ITEM15_P126_S1	Of the preferred stock, 240,000 shares are designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

837465_11_ITEM15_P126_S3	The remaining shares of preferred stock are undesignated as to series, rights, preferences, privileges or restrictions.
837465_11_ITEM15_P127_S0	The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the Company s shareholders.
837465_11_ITEM15_P127_S1	Although to date no shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock have been issued, if such shares were issued, each share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock would entitle the holder thereof to 1,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company.
837465_11_ITEM15_P128_S0	The 7.50% Series B Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock has no maturity date or, except in limited circumstances, voting rights prior to conversion to common stock.
837465_11_ITEM15_P129_S0	The holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of common stock shall generally vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of the Company s shareholders.
837465_11_ITEM15_P129_S1	Shareholders entitled to vote for the election of directors are entitled to vote cumulatively for one or more nominees.

837465_11_ITEM15_P130_S1	The November 2007 repurchase program supersedes all prior stock repurchase authorizations.
837465_11_ITEM15_P130_S2	During 2010, the Company repurchased 88,000 shares of its common stock under the November 2007 repurchase program at an average cost per share of $8.32 for a total cost of $725,000.
837465_11_ITEM15_P130_S3	These shares were repurchased to settle shares withheld for taxes due by holders of restricted stock awards.
837465_11_ITEM15_P130_S4	The Company s repurchases of shares of common stock are recorded at cost and result in a reduction of shareholders equity.
837465_11_ITEM15_P130_S5	As of December 31, 2010, the Company remained authorized to repurchase up to an additional $75,165,000 of its common stock under the November 2007 repurchase program.
837465_11_ITEM15_P131_S0	In July 1995, the Company established the Callaway Golf Company Grantor Stock Trust (the GST ) for the purpose of funding the Company s obligations with respect to one or more of the Company s nonqualified or qualified employee benefit plans.
837465_11_ITEM15_P131_S1	The GST shares are used primarily for the settlement of employee equity-based awards, including restricted stock awards and units, stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases.
837465_11_ITEM15_P131_S2	The existence of the GST will have no impact upon the amount of benefits or compensation that will be paid under the Company s employee benefit plans.
837465_11_ITEM15_P132_S0	The GST acquires, holds and distributes shares of the Company s common stock in accordance with the terms of the trust.
837465_11_ITEM15_P132_S1	Shares held by the GST are voted in accordance with voting directions from eligible employees of the Company as specified in the GST.
837465_11_ITEM15_P133_S0	In conjunction with the formation of the GST, the Company issued 4,000,000 shares of newly issued common stock to the GST in exchange for a promissory note in the amount of $60,575,000 ($15.14 per share).
837465_11_ITEM15_P133_S1	In December 1995, the Company issued an additional 1,300,000 shares of newly issued common stock to the GST in exchange for a promissory note in the amount of $26,263,000 ($20.20 per share).

837465_11_ITEM15_P133_S3	The issuance of these shares to the GST had no net impact on shareholders equity.
837465_11_ITEM15_P134_S0	For financial reporting purposes, the GST is consolidated with the Company.
837465_11_ITEM15_P134_S1	The value of shares owned by the GST are accounted for as a reduction to shareholders equity until the shares are issued.
837465_11_ITEM15_P134_S2	Each period, the shares owned by the GST are valued at the closing market price, with corresponding changes in the GST balance reflected in additional paid-in capital.
837465_11_ITEM15_P134_S3	The issuance of shares by the GST is accounted for by reducing the GST and additional paid-in capital accounts proportionately as the shares are released.
837465_11_ITEM15_P134_S4	The GST does not impact the determination or amount of compensation expense for the benefit plans being settled.
837465_11_ITEM15_P134_S5	The GST shares do not have any impact on the Company s earnings per share until they are issued in connection with the settlement of restricted stock units, stock option exercises, employee stock plan purchases or other awards.
837465_11_ITEM15_P134_S6	The following table presents shares released from the GST for the settlement of employee stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:
837465_11_ITEM15_P135_S0	The Company accounts for its share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 718, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values.
837465_11_ITEM15_P135_S1	ASC Topic 718 further requires a reduction in share-based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_11_ITEM15_P136_S0	The forfeiture rate used by the Company is based on historical forfeiture trends.
837465_11_ITEM15_P136_S1	If actual forfeiture rates are not consistent with the Company s estimates, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods.
837465_11_ITEM15_P136_S2	The Company uses the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation pursuant to ASC Topic 718.
837465_11_ITEM15_P136_S3	The alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool ( APIC Pool ) related to the tax effects of employee share-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC Pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee and director share-based awards that were outstanding upon adoption of ASC Topic 718.

837465_11_ITEM15_P139_S6	The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
837465_11_ITEM15_P139_S7	The model uses various assumptions, including a risk-free interest rate, the expected term of the options, the expected stock price volatility, and the expected dividend yield.
837465_11_ITEM15_P140_S0	Compensation expense for employee stock options is recognized ratably over the vesting term and is reduced by an estimate for pre-vesting forfeitures, which is based on the Company s historical forfeitures of unvested options and awards.
837465_11_ITEM15_P140_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the average estimated pre-vesting forfeiture rate used was 3.5%, 4.4% and 4.8%, respectively.

837465_11_ITEM15_P142_S2	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected term of the options at the date of the grant.
837465_11_ITEM15_P142_S3	The expected life of the Company s options is based on evaluations of historical and expected future employee exercise behavior, forfeitures, cancellations and other factors.
837465_11_ITEM15_P143_S0	applied in this calculation utilizes highly subjective assumptions that could potentially change over time.
837465_11_ITEM15_P143_S1	Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option.
837465_11_ITEM15_P143_S2	Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by the employee holding the option.

837465_11_ITEM15_P149_S0	The fair value of nonvested Restricted Stock awards, Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Units (collectively nonvested shares ) is determined based on the closing trading price of the Company s common stock on the grant date.
837465_11_ITEM15_P149_S1	A summary of the Company s nonvested share activity for the year ended December 31, 2010 is as follows (in thousands, except fair value amounts):

837465_11_ITEM15_P152_S1	These awards cliff vest over two and three year periods and are accounted for in long-term compensation.
837465_11_ITEM15_P152_S2	The estimated fair value of these awards on the date of grant is based on the closing price of the Company s common stock multiplied by the number of shares underlying the phantom stock units awarded.
837465_11_ITEM15_P152_S3	The long-term compensation liability is subsequently remeasured based on the fair value of the awards at the end of each interim reporting period through the settlement date of the awards.
837465_11_ITEM15_P152_S4	Once these awards have one year left remaining in the vesting period, that portion of the liability is reclassified to accrued employee compensation expense and benefits in current liabilities.
837465_11_ITEM15_P153_S0	Total compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

837465_11_ITEM15_P160_S0	During 2010, 2009 and 2008, tax benefits related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards were $492,000, $1,028,000 and $1,379,000, respectively.
837465_11_ITEM15_P160_S1	Such benefits were recorded as a reduction of income taxes payable with a corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital or a decrease to deferred tax assets in connection with compensation cost previously recognized in income.
837465_11_ITEM15_P161_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent according to the classification of the related asset or liability.
837465_11_ITEM15_P161_S1	Significant components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows (in thousands):
837465_11_ITEM15_P162_S0	The current year change in net deferred taxes of $4,368,000 is comprised of a net deferred expense of $52,000 related to ASC Topic 740-25-6 reserves offset by a net deferred benefit of $4,420,000 recorded through current income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2010.
837465_11_ITEM15_P162_S1	The Company has federal and state income tax credit carryforwards of $2,239,000 and $5,885,000 respectively, which will expire at various dates beginning in 2011.
837465_11_ITEM15_P162_S2	Such credit carryforward expire as follows: The Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $4,766,000 reflecting the benefit of operating loss carryforwards.
837465_11_ITEM15_P162_S3	The deferred tax assets expire as follows: Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are anticipated to be in effect at the time the differences are expected to reverse.
837465_11_ITEM15_P162_S4	The realization of the deferred the tax assets, including the loss and credit carryforwards listed above, is subject to the Company generating sufficient taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become realizable.
837465_11_ITEM15_P163_S0	allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
837465_11_ITEM15_P164_S0	In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire.
837465_11_ITEM15_P164_S1	These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment, including estimates of future taxable income.
837465_11_ITEM15_P164_S2	These estimates are based on the Company s best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions.
837465_11_ITEM15_P164_S3	At December 31, 2010, the Company had deferred tax assets of $69,237,000.
837465_11_ITEM15_P164_S4	Approximately $62,694,000 of the deferred tax assets pertain to the Company s U.S. business and $6,543,000 pertain to foreign jurisdictions.
837465_11_ITEM15_P164_S5	In evaluating the likelihood that these deferred tax assets will be realized, the Company considered the Company s taxable loss in the United States in each of the past two years, the reasons for such loss, the Company s projected financial forecast for 2011 and 2012, and any applicable expiration dates.
837465_11_ITEM15_P164_S6	As a result of this evaluation, the Company concluded that (except for some discrete items for which it established a non-cash valuation allowance as discussed below) it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized.
837465_11_ITEM15_P165_S0	If the Company s operating losses in the United States do not recover and return to profitability as projected by management, the Company could be required to establish a non-cash valuation allowance against a portion or all of the U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_11_ITEM15_P165_S1	At December 31, 2010, the Company recorded a non-cash valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets in the amount of $1,704,000 related to state tax credit carryforwards and $511,000 related to certain Top-Flite deferred tax assets existing at the time of the acquisition.
837465_11_ITEM15_P165_S2	In the future, if the Company determines that the realization of the Top-Flite deferred tax assets is more likely than not, the reversal of the related valuation allowance will reduce the provision for income taxes.
837465_11_ITEM15_P166_S0	The change in the valuation allowance during 2010 resulted primarily from the reversal of the deferred tax assets and related allowance on certain state net operating losses and state tax credits that expired unutilized.
837465_11_ITEM15_P167_S0	The Company has a significant amount of U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs ) and other losses.
837465_11_ITEM15_P167_S1	The Company s ability to utilize the losses to offset future taxable income may be limited significantly if the Company were to experience an ownership change as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
837465_11_ITEM15_P167_S2	In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in ownership of the Company s stock by 5-percent shareholders (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
837465_11_ITEM15_P167_S3	The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred for purposes of Section 382 is complex and requires significant judgment.
837465_11_ITEM15_P167_S4	The extent to which the Company s ability to utilize the losses is limited as a result of such an ownership change depends on many variables, including the value of the Company s stock at the time of the ownership change.
837465_11_ITEM15_P167_S5	Although the Company s ownership has changed significantly during the three-year period ended December 31, 2010 (due in significant part to the Company s June 2009 preferred stock offering), the Company does not believe there has been a cumulative increase in ownership in excess of 50 percentage points during that period.
837465_11_ITEM15_P167_S6	The Company continues to monitor changes in ownership.
837465_11_ITEM15_P167_S7	If such a cumulative increase did occur in any three year period and the Company were limited in the amount of losses it could use to offset taxable income, the Company s results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted.
837465_11_ITEM15_P168_S0	A reconciliation of the effective tax rate on income or loss and the statutory tax rate is as follows: In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the tax rate benefited from net favorable adjustments to previously estimated tax liabilities in the amount of $515,000, $457,000 and $1,716,000, respectively.
837465_11_ITEM15_P168_S1	The most significant favorable adjustments in each year related to adjustments resulting from the finalization of the Company s prior year U.S. and state income tax returns as well as agreements reached with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and other major jurisdictions on certain issues necessitating a reassessment of the Company s tax exposures for all open tax years, with no individual year being significantly affected.
837465_11_ITEM15_P168_S2	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):
837465_11_ITEM15_P169_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax benefits was $9,121,000 and can be reduced by $4,110,000 of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments which was recorded as a long-term income tax receivable, as well as $978,000 of tax benefits associated with state income taxes and other timing adjustments which are recorded as deferred income taxes pursuant to ASC Topic 740-25-6.
837465_11_ITEM15_P170_S0	The net amount of $4,033,000, if recognized, would affect the Company s financial statements and favorably affect the Company s effective income tax rate.
837465_11_ITEM15_P170_S1	The Company does expect changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months; however, the Company does not expect the changes to have a material impact on its results of operations or its financial position.
837465_11_ITEM15_P171_S0	The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
837465_11_ITEM15_P171_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized a net benefit of approximately $490,000, $190,000 and $195,000, respectively, related to interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes.
837465_11_ITEM15_P171_S2	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had accrued $648,000 and $1,139,000, respectively, (before income tax benefit) for the payment of interest and penalties.
837465_11_ITEM15_P171_S3	During 2010 the Company concluded an audit by the IRS for tax years 2005 through 2007.
837465_11_ITEM15_P171_S4	The results of the examination did not have a material effect on the financial statements.
837465_11_ITEM15_P172_S0	The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and foreign jurisdictions.
837465_11_ITEM15_P172_S1	The Company is generally no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities in its major jurisdictions as follows:
837465_11_ITEM15_P173_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company did not provide for United States income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on a cumulative total of $85,000,000 of undistributed earnings from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that will be permanently reinvested outside the United States.
837465_11_ITEM15_P173_S1	Upon remittance, certain foreign countries impose withholding taxes that are then available, subject to certain limitations, for use as credits against the Company s U.S. tax liability, if any.
837465_11_ITEM15_P173_S2	It is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability on such unremitted earnings.
837465_11_ITEM15_P173_S3	Should the Company repatriate foreign earnings, the Company would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period management determined that the Company would repatriate earnings.
837465_11_ITEM15_P174_S0	Commitments and Contingencies Legal Matters In conjunction with the Company s program of enforcing its proprietary rights, the Company has initiated or may initiate actions against alleged infringers under the intellectual property laws of various countries, including, for example, the U.S. Lanham Act, the U.S. Patent Act, and other pertinent laws.
837465_11_ITEM15_P175_S0	The Company is also active internationally.
837465_11_ITEM15_P175_S1	For example, it has worked with other golf equipment manufacturers to encourage Chinese and other foreign government officials to conduct raids of identified counterfeiters, resulting in the seizure and destruction of counterfeit golf clubs and, in some cases, criminal prosecution of the counterfeiters.
837465_11_ITEM15_P175_S2	Defendants in these actions may, among other things, contest the validity and/or the enforceability of some of the Company s patents and/or trademarks.
837465_11_ITEM15_P175_S3	Others may assert counterclaims against the Company.
837465_11_ITEM15_P175_S4	Historically, these matters individually, and in the aggregate, have not had a material adverse effect upon the consolidated financial position of the Company.
837465_11_ITEM15_P175_S5	It is possible, however, that in the future one or more defenses or claims asserted by defendants in one or more of those actions may succeed, resulting in the loss of all or part of the rights under one or more patents, loss of a trademark, a monetary award against the Company or some other material loss to the Company.
837465_11_ITEM15_P175_S6	One or more of these results could adversely affect the Company s overall ability to protect its product designs and ultimately limit its future success in the marketplace.
837465_11_ITEM15_P175_S7	In addition, the Company from time to time receives information claiming that products sold by the Company infringe or may infringe patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties.
837465_11_ITEM15_P175_S8	It is possible that one or more claims of potential infringement could lead to litigation, the need to obtain licenses, the need to alter a product to avoid infringement, a settlement or judgment, or some other action or material loss by the Company.
837465_11_ITEM15_P176_S0	On February 9, 2006, Callaway Golf filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Delaware (Case No.
837465_11_ITEM15_P176_S1	C.A. 06-91) asserting patent infringement claims against Acushnet, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fortune Brands, alleging that Acushnet s Titleist Pro V1 family of golf balls infringed nine claims contained in four golf ball patents owned by Callaway Golf.
837465_11_ITEM15_P176_S2	Acushnet later stipulated that the Pro V1 golf balls infringed the nine asserted claims, and the case proceeded to trial on the sole issue of validity.
837465_11_ITEM15_P177_S0	On December 14, 2007, a jury found that eight of the nine patent claims asserted by the Company against Acushnet were valid, holding one claim invalid.
837465_11_ITEM15_P177_S1	The District Court entered judgment in favor of the Company and against Acushnet on December 20, 2007.
837465_11_ITEM15_P178_S0	Acushnet s motions for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law.
837465_11_ITEM15_P178_S1	Acushnet appealed the District Court s judgment to the Federal Circuit (Appeal No. 2009-1076).
837465_11_ITEM15_P178_S2	On August 14, 2009, the Federal Circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded the case for a new trial.
837465_11_ITEM15_P178_S3	The Federal Circuit affirmed the trial court s rulings with respect to claim construction, and evidentiary rulings made during the trial and rejected Acushnet s motion for judgment as a matter of law, but ruled that the jury s inconsistent verdicts and an error granting partial summary judgment on Acushnet s anticipation defense required the case against Acushnet to be retried.
837465_11_ITEM15_P178_S4	As a result of its ruling, the Federal Circuit also vacated the permanent injunction.
837465_11_ITEM15_P179_S0	Acushnet filed a petition for review by the United States Supreme Court which was denied on February 22, 2010.
837465_11_ITEM15_P179_S1	The case was retried based upon Callaway Golf s asserted claims.
837465_11_ITEM15_P179_S2	On March 29, 2010, after a five-day trial, a jury found that the asserted claims were invalid as anticipated and obvious.
837465_11_ITEM15_P179_S3	Callaway Golf has moved for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law.
837465_11_ITEM15_P179_S4	Callaway Golf s motion was fully briefed on June 15, 2010 and is pending for a decision in the district court.
837465_11_ITEM15_P179_S5	Acushnet has also filed requests for reexamination with the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) challenging the validity of the four patents asserted in the litigation.
837465_11_ITEM15_P179_S6	The Company believes that if it secures a favorable final decision from the district court proceedings before all appeals associated with the reexaminations are completed, the reexamination process will be terminated with respect to the patent claims at issue in the litigation.
837465_11_ITEM15_P180_S0	An examiner at the PTO has issued decisions rejecting the claims of the four patents at issue in the litigation.
837465_11_ITEM15_P180_S1	The examiner s rejections have been appealed to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences ( BPAI ).
837465_11_ITEM15_P180_S2	The BPAI heard argument on the appeals on January 19, 2011.
837465_11_ITEM15_P180_S3	The Company continues to believe that the administrative process will take time and that at least some of the prior claims or newly framed claims submitted as part of the reexamination proceeding will eventually be affirmed.
837465_11_ITEM15_P181_S0	If the BPAI does not affirm the claims in the patents subject to reexamination, an appeal will be taken by the Company to the Federal Circuit.
837465_11_ITEM15_P182_S0	Callaway Golf has asserted that Acushnet s request for PTO reexamination of the patents that are the subject of the district court patent infringement litigation discussed above breached a settlement agreement between Acushnet and Callaway Golf s predecessor in interest, Top-Flite.
837465_11_ITEM15_P182_S1	On January 13, 2011, the district court hearing the patent infringement action entered an order holding that Acushnet breached the settlement agreement.
837465_11_ITEM15_P182_S2	Callaway Golf has advised the PTO of the district court s breach of contract order and has requested that the PTO stop the reexamination proceedings.
837465_11_ITEM15_P182_S3	That request is pending at the PTO.
837465_11_ITEM15_P182_S4	If the patents are invalidated by the PTO, and that decision is upheld by the Federal Circuit, Callaway Golf will pursue all available damages arising from Acushnet s breach, including the damages that would have been available had it prevailed on its patent infringement claims.
837465_11_ITEM15_P183_S0	On March 3, 2009, the Company filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Case No.
837465_11_ITEM15_P183_S1	C.A. 09-131, asserting claims against Acushnet for patent infringement.
837465_11_ITEM15_P183_S2	Specifically, the Company asserts that two golf ball patents acquired from Top-Flite are infringed by Acushnet s sale of Titleist Pro V1 golf balls introduced after entry of the Court s permanent injunction referenced above.
837465_11_ITEM15_P183_S3	In the second suit, the Company is seeking damages and an injunction to prevent infringement by Acushnet.
837465_11_ITEM15_P183_S4	Acushnet s response to the complaint was filed on April 17, 2009.
837465_11_ITEM15_P183_S5	The case is in the discovery phase.
837465_11_ITEM15_P183_S6	Trial has been set for March 2012.
837465_11_ITEM15_P183_S7	Acushnet has filed requests for reexamination with the PTO challenging the validity of the two patents asserted by the Company in the second suit filed against Acushnet.
837465_11_ITEM15_P183_S8	The PTO has issued a final office action rejecting the claims of one of the patents and the Company has appealed that rejection to the BPAI; the other patent is still being reviewed by the examiner.
837465_11_ITEM15_P184_S0	On March 3, 2009, Acushnet filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Case No.
837465_11_ITEM15_P184_S1	C.A. 09-130, asserting claims against the Company for patent infringement.
837465_11_ITEM15_P184_S2	Specifically, Acushnet asserts that the Company s sale of the Tour i and Tour ix golf balls infringe nine Acushnet golf ball patents.
837465_11_ITEM15_P184_S3	Acushnet has since dropped one of the patents, but expanded its infringement contentions to allege that seven other models of the Company s golf balls, using Callaway Golf s patented HX surface geometry, infringe five of the Acushnet patents asserted in the new suit.
837465_11_ITEM15_P185_S0	The Company s response to the complaint was filed on April 17, 2009, and the case has been consolidated for discovery and pretrial with Callaway Golf s March 3, 2009 case against Acushnet, described above.
837465_11_ITEM15_P185_S1	The case by Acushnet has also been set for trial in March 2012.
837465_11_ITEM15_P185_S2	The district court has not yet determined whether the cases will be tried together or separately.
837465_11_ITEM15_P186_S0	On May 8, 2008, Kenji Inaba filed a suit against Callaway Golf Japan in the Osaka District Court in Japan.
837465_11_ITEM15_P186_S1	Inaba has alleged that certain golf balls sold by Callaway Golf Japan with a hex aerodynamic pattern infringe his Japanese utility design patent No. 3,478,303 and his Japanese design patent No. 1,300,582.
837465_11_ITEM15_P186_S2	Inaba is seeking damages pursuant to a royalty based on sales.
837465_11_ITEM15_P186_S3	Callaway Golf Japan filed an administrative proceeding in the Japan Patent and Trademark Office ( Japan PTO ) seeking to invalidate the patents in suit.
837465_11_ITEM15_P186_S4	The Japan PTO ruled that the asserted claims in the Inaba patents are invalid.
837465_11_ITEM15_P186_S5	The Osaka District Court also ruled, on different grounds, that the patents are invalid and also that Callaway Golf does not infringe the patents.
837465_11_ITEM15_P186_S6	Inaba appealed both the Osaka District Court and Japan PTO rulings to the Japan Intellectual Property High Court.
837465_11_ITEM15_P186_S7	On December 13, 2010, the Japan Intellectual Property High Court held the 582 patent invalid, and ruled that Callaway Golf had not infringed the 303 patent.
837465_11_ITEM15_P186_S8	Inaba did not appeal the court s ruling and the matter is concluded.
837465_11_ITEM15_P187_S0	On January 19, 2009, the Company filed suit in the Superior Court for the County of San Diego, Case No. 37-2009-00050363-CU-BC-NC, against Corporate Trade International, Inc. ( CTI ) seeking damages for breach of contract and for declaratory relief based on the asserted use and transfer of corporate trade credits to the Company in connection with the purchase of assets from Top-Flite in 2003.
837465_11_ITEM15_P187_S1	On January 26, 2009, CTI filed its own suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Case No. 09CV0698, asserting claims for breach of contract, account stated and unjust enrichment, and seeking damages of approximately $8,900,000.
837465_11_ITEM15_P187_S2	On February 26, 2009, CTI removed the Company s San Diego case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, and filed a motion to dismiss, stay, or transfer the California action to New York.
837465_11_ITEM15_P187_S3	On March 1, 2010, the San Diego case was transferred to the Southern District of New York where it has been assigned to the same judge as the New York case.
837465_11_ITEM15_P187_S4	Fact discovery was largely completed by January 31, 2011.
837465_11_ITEM15_P187_S5	No trial date has been set.
837465_11_ITEM15_P188_S0	In addition to the matters specifically noted above, the Company, incident to its business activities, is subject to a number of legal proceedings, claims, and investigations, including claims of alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, indemnification claims, and claims related to commercial or employment disputes.
837465_11_ITEM15_P188_S1	If it becomes probable that the Company will incur a loss with respect to any such legal matter and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable, the Company records an accrual for the estimated amount of the loss.
837465_11_ITEM15_P188_S2	The Company reviews all such legal matters at least quarterly and establishes or adjusts its accruals for such matters to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.
837465_11_ITEM15_P188_S3	All legal costs associated with such legal matters are expensed as incurred.
837465_11_ITEM15_P188_S4	The Company believes that it has valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against the Company.
837465_11_ITEM15_P188_S5	Legal matters, however, are inherently unpredictable and the resolution of those matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance.
837465_11_ITEM15_P188_S6	Consequently, management is unable to estimate the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability, amounts which may be covered by insurance, or the financial impact that will result from the legal matters pending against the Company.
837465_11_ITEM15_P188_S7	Management, however, believes at this time that the final resolution of the legal matters pending against the Company, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company s consolidated financial condition.
837465_11_ITEM15_P189_S0	Lease Commitments The Company leases certain warehouse, distribution and office facilities, vehicles as well as office equipment under operating leases.
837465_11_ITEM15_P189_S1	Lease terms range from 1 to 8 years expiring at various dates through February 2018, with options to renew at varying terms.
837465_11_ITEM15_P189_S2	Commitments for minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2010 are as follows (in thousands):
837465_11_ITEM15_P189_S3	Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $13,967,000, $13,567,000 and $12,985,000, respectively.
837465_11_ITEM15_P190_S0	During the normal course of its business, the Company enters into agreements to purchase goods and services, including purchase commitments for production materials, endorsement agreements with professional golfers and other endorsers, employment and consulting agreements, and intellectual property licensing agreements pursuant to which the Company is required to pay royalty fees.
837465_11_ITEM15_P190_S1	It is not possible to determine the amounts the Company will ultimately be required to pay under these agreements as they are subject to many variables including performance-based bonuses, reductions in payment obligations if designated minimum performance criteria are not achieved, and severance arrangements.
837465_11_ITEM15_P190_S2	As of December 31, 2010, the Company has entered into many of these contractual agreements with terms ranging from one to four years.
837465_11_ITEM15_P190_S3	The minimum obligation that the Company is required to pay under these agreements is $88,081,000 over the next four years.
837465_11_ITEM15_P190_S4	In addition, the Company also enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders or other documentation or that are undocumented except for an invoice.
837465_11_ITEM15_P190_S5	Such unconditional purchase obligations are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected in this total.
837465_11_ITEM15_P191_S0	During its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions.
837465_11_ITEM15_P191_S1	These include (i) intellectual property indemnities to the Company s customers and licensees in connection with the use, sale and/or license of Company products, (ii) indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facilities or leases, (iii) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to the goods and services provided to the Company or based on the negligence or willful misconduct of the Company and (iv) indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts.
837465_11_ITEM15_P192_S0	addition, the Company has consulting agreements that provide for payment of nominal fees upon the issuance of patents and/or the commercialization of research results.
837465_11_ITEM15_P192_S1	The Company has also issued guarantees in the form of a standby letter of credit as security for contingent liabilities under certain workers compensation insurance policies.
837465_11_ITEM15_P192_S2	In addition, in connection with the uPlay asset acquisition (see Note 7), the Company could be required to pay an additional purchase price, not to exceed $10,000,000, based on a percentage of earnings generated from the sale of uPlay products over a period of three years ending on December 31, 2011.
837465_11_ITEM15_P192_S3	As of December 31, 2010, based on the Company s preliminary assessment of certain performance indicators in connection with the sale of uPlay products, the probability of the Company fulfilling this additional purchase price obligation at the end of the three year period ending December 31, 2011, is remote.
837465_11_ITEM15_P192_S4	The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases, may be indefinite.
837465_11_ITEM15_P192_S5	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be obligated to make.
837465_11_ITEM15_P193_S0	Historically, costs incurred to settle claims related to indemnities have not been material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_11_ITEM15_P193_S1	In addition, the Company believes the likelihood is remote that material payments will be required under the indemnities, commitments and guarantees described above.
837465_11_ITEM15_P194_S0	The fair value of indemnities, commitments and guarantees that the Company issued during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was not material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_11_ITEM15_P195_S0	The Company has entered into employment contracts with each of the Company s officers.
837465_11_ITEM15_P195_S1	These contracts generally provide for severance benefits, including salary continuation, if employment is terminated by the Company for convenience or by the officer for substantial cause.
837465_11_ITEM15_P195_S2	In addition, in order to assure that the officers would continue to provide independent leadership consistent with the Company s best interests in the event of an actual or threatened change in control of the Company, the contracts also generally provide for certain protections in the event of such a change in control.
837465_11_ITEM15_P195_S3	These protections include the payment of certain severance benefits, including salary continuation, upon the termination of employment following a change in control.
837465_11_ITEM15_P196_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company s foreign currency exchange contracts are measured and reported on a fair value basis in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ).
837465_11_ITEM15_P196_S1	ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements.
837465_11_ITEM15_P196_S2	ASC 820 enables the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values.
837465_11_ITEM15_P196_S3	ASC 820 requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value will be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: Observable market based inputs that are corroborated by market data Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data The following table summarizes the valuation of the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts by the above pricing levels as of the valuation dates listed (in thousands):
837465_11_ITEM15_P197_S0	The fair value of the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts is determined based on observable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
837465_11_ITEM15_P197_S1	Foreign currency derivatives on the balance sheet are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the statement of operations.
837465_11_ITEM15_P198_S0	The Company s operating segments are organized on the basis of products and include golf clubs and golf balls.
837465_11_ITEM15_P198_S1	The golf clubs segment consists primarily of Callaway Golf, Top-Flite and Ben Hogan woods, hybrids, irons, wedges and putters as well as Odyssey putters, pre-owned clubs, GPS on-course range finders, other golf-related accessories and royalties from licensing of the Company s trademarks and service marks.
837465_11_ITEM15_P198_S2	The golf balls segment consists primarily of Callaway Golf and Top-Flite golf balls that are designed, manufactured and sold by the Company.
837465_11_ITEM15_P198_S3	There are no significant intersegment transactions.
837465_11_ITEM15_P199_S0	The table below contains information utilized by management to evaluate its operating segments.
837465_11_ITEM15_P200_S0	(1) Certain costs associated with gift card promotions for 2009 have been reclassified from accessories and other into the applicable product categories to conform with the presentation as of December 31, 2010.
837465_11_ITEM15_P200_S1	The Company s gift card promotions during 2008 did not have a material impact to the Company s results of operations and therefore, the amounts presented for 2008 were not impacted by this reclassification.
837465_11_ITEM15_P201_S0	(4) Represents corporate general and administrative expenses and other income (expense) not utilized by management in determining segment profitability.
837465_11_ITEM15_P201_S1	In 2010, the reconciling items include a pre-tax impairment charge of $7,547,000 in connection with certain trademarks and trade names (see Note 9).
837465_11_ITEM15_P201_S2	In 2008, the reconciling items include a one-time pre-tax reversal of $19,922,000 in connection with the Company s termination of a long-term energy supply contract (see Note 11).
837465_11_ITEM15_P202_S0	(5) Identifiable assets are comprised of net inventory, certain property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill.
837465_11_ITEM15_P202_S1	Reconciling items represent unallocated corporate assets not segregated between the two segments.
837465_11_ITEM15_P203_S0	The Company s net sales by product category are as follows:
837465_11_ITEM15_P204_S0	(1) Certain costs associated with gift card promotions have been reclassified from accessories and other into the applicable product categories to conform with the current period presentation.
837465_11_ITEM15_P204_S1	The Company s gift card promotions during 2008 did not have a material impact to the Company s results of operations and therefore, the amounts presented for 2008 were not impacted by this reclassification.
837465_11_ITEM15_P205_S0	The Company markets its products in the United States and internationally, with its principal international markets being Japan and Europe.

837465_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Product Design and Development Product design at the Company is a result of the integrated efforts of its brand management, research and development, manufacturing and sales departments, all of which work together to generate new ideas for golf equipment.
837465_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	The Company has not limited itself in its research efforts by trying to duplicate designs that are traditional or conventional and believes it has created a work environment in which new ideas are valued and explored.
837465_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company invested $34.3 million, $36.4 million and $32.2 million, respectively, in research and development.
837465_12_ITEM1_P12_S3	The Company intends to continue to invest substantial amounts in its research and development activities in connection with its development of new products.
837465_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	The Company has the ability to create and modify product designs by using computer aided design ( CAD ) software, computer aided manufacturing ( CAM ) software and computer numerical control milling equipment.
837465_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	CAD software enables designers to develop computer models of new product designs.
837465_12_ITEM1_P13_S2	CAM software is then used by engineers to translate the digital output from CAD computer models so that physical prototypes can be produced.
837465_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	robots, launch monitors, a proprietary virtual test center, a proprietary performance analysis system, an indoor test range and other methods to develop and test its products.
837465_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	Through the use of these technologies, the Company has been able to accelerate and make more efficient the design, development and testing of new golf clubs and golf balls.
837465_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	For certain risks associated with product design and development, see below, Certain Factors Affecting Callaway Golf Company contained in Item 1A. Manufacturing The Company s golf clubs are assembled using components obtained from suppliers both internationally and within the United States.
837465_12_ITEM1_P14_S3	Significant progress has been made in automating certain facets of the manufacturing process during the last few years and continued emphasis will be placed on automated manufacturing by the Company.
837465_12_ITEM1_P14_S4	However, the overall golf club assembly process remains fairly labor intensive, and requires extensive global supply chain coordination.
837465_12_ITEM1_P14_S5	With respect to golf balls, although a significant amount of labor is still used, the overall manufacturing process is much more automated than the golf club assembly process.
837465_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the Company substantially completed the final phase of its planned Global Operations Strategy Initiatives (see Note 3 Restructuring Initiatives to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
837465_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	These initiatives were designed to add speed and flexibility to meet customer service demands, optimize efficiencies, and facilitate long-term gross margin improvements.
837465_12_ITEM1_P15_S2	During 2011, the Company (i) completed the reorganization of its manufacturing and distribution centers located in Carlsbad, California, Toronto, Canada, and Chicopee, Massachusetts, (ii) transitioned to the use of third-party logistics in Dallas, Texas and Toronto, Canada, and (iii) completed the establishment of a new production facility in Monterrey, Mexico.
837465_12_ITEM1_P15_S3	As a result of these changes, during 2011, approximately 79% and 67% of the Company s golf club and golf ball production volume, respectively, was generated in regions outside the U.S. compared to 60% during 2010 for both golf clubs and golf balls.
837465_12_ITEM1_P15_S4	At the conclusion of 2011, almost all of the Company s golf club production volume and 75% of golf ball production volume was generated in regions outside of the United States.
837465_12_ITEM1_P15_S5	The Company maintains limited golf club assembly in its facilities in Carlsbad, California and manufactures the balance of golf ball production volume at its facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts.
837465_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	Raw Materials The Company purchases raw materials from numerous domestic and international suppliers in order to meet scheduled production needs.
837465_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	Raw materials include steel, titanium alloys and carbon fiber for the manufacturing of golf clubs, and rubber, plastic ionomers, zinc sterate, zinc oxide and lime stone for the manufacturing of golf balls.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Certain Factors Affecting Callaway Golf Company The Company s business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We urge you to carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those risks set forth under the heading entitled Important Notice to Investors, and in other documents that the Company files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, before making any investment decision with respect to the Company s securities.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop, the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Under these circumstances, the trading prices of the Company s securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in the Company s securities.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Unfavorable economic conditions could have a negative impact on consumer discretionary spending and therefore reduce sales of the Company s products.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The Company sells golf clubs, golf balls and golf accessories.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These products are recreational in nature and are therefore discretionary purchases for consumers.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases of golf products during favorable economic conditions and when consumers are feeling confident and prosperous.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Discretionary spending is also affected by many other factors, including general business conditions, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxes, and consumer confidence in future economic conditions.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Purchases of the Company s products could decline during periods when disposable income is lower, or during periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P1_S5	A significant or prolonged decline in general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that adversely affect consumer discretionary spending, whether in the United States or in the Company s international markets, could result in reduced sales of the Company s products, which could have a negative impact on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The Company s operating results may be adversely affected by the current debt crisis in Europe and elsewhere and by related global economic conditions.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The current Greek debt crisis and related European financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the European currencies, including the Euro, to further deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of European customers.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	In addition, the European crisis is contributing to instability in global credit markets.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	economic conditions in Europe, the United States or other key markets, remain uncertain, persist, or deteriorate further, consumer purchasing power and demand for Company products could decline, which could have a material adverse impacts on the Company s operating results and financial condition and cash flows.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	A severe or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our customers financial condition, their levels of business activity and their ability to pay trade obligations.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The Company primarily sells its products to golf equipment retailers directly and through wholly-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries, and to foreign distributors.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally requires no collateral from these customers.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Historically, the Company s bad debt expense has been low.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	However, a prolonged downturn in the general economy could adversely affect the retail golf equipment market which in turn, would negatively impact the liquidity and cash flows of our customers, including the ability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and to pay their trade obligations.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P4_S4	This could result in increased delinquent or uncollectible accounts for some of the Company s significant customers.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P4_S5	A failure by the Company s customers to pay on a timely basis a significant portion of outstanding account receivable balances would adversely impact the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P4_S6	The Company has significant international sales and purchases, and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the Company s results of operations.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	A significant portion of the Company s purchases and sales are international purchases and sales, and the Company conducts transactions in approximately 19 currencies worldwide.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Conducting business in such various currencies exposes the Company to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The Company s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	As a result, transactions conducted in foreign currencies must be translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes based upon the applicable foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Fluctuations in these foreign currency exchange rates therefore may positively or negatively affect the Company s reported financial results and can significantly affect period-over-period comparisons.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The effect of the translation of foreign currencies on the Company s financial results can be significant.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The Company therefore engages in certain hedging activities to mitigate over time the impact of the translation of foreign currencies on the Company s financial results.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The Company s hedging activities can reduce, but will not eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The extent to which the Company s hedging activities mitigate the effects of foreign currency translation varies based upon many factors, including the amount of transactions being hedged.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Other factors that could affect the effectiveness of the Company s hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts, volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Since the hedging activities are designed to reduce volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar but also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The Company s future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts business.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Foreign currency fluctuations can also affect the prices at which products are sold in the Company s international markets.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	The Company therefore adjusts its pricing based in part upon fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Significant unanticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates make it more difficult for the Company to manage pricing in its international markets.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P7_S4	If the Company is unable to adjust its pricing in a timely manner to counteract the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, the Company s pricing may not be competitive in the marketplace and the Company s financial results in its international markets could be adversely affected.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Company s obligations and certain financial covenants contained under the existing credit facility expose it to risks that could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The Company s primary credit facility is comprised of a $230.0 million secured asset-based revolving credit facility (as amended, the ABL Facility ), comprised of a $158.3 million U.S. facility, a $31.7 million Canadian facility and a $40.0 million United Kingdom facility, in each case subject to borrowing base availability under the applicable facility.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Borrowing under the U.K. facility will be permitted upon satisfaction of customary conditions relating to delivery of U.K. collateral security documents.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are secured by certain assets, including inventory and accounts receivable, of the Company s U.S., Canadian and U.K. legal entities.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The Company s borrowing is limited by the availability ratio, which is expressed as a percentage, of (a) the average daily availability under the ABL Facility to (b) the sum of the Canadian, the U.K. and the U.S. borrowing bases, as adjusted.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	All applicable margins will be permanently reduced by 0.25% if EBITDA, as defined in the ABL Facility, meets or exceeds $25.0 million over any trailing twelve-month period, and will be permanently reduced by an additional 0.25% if EBITDA meets or exceeds $50.0 million over any trailing twelve-month period.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The ABL Facility includes certain restrictions including, among other things, restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, liens, dividends and other restricted payments, asset sales, investments, mergers, acquisitions and affiliate transactions.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Additionally, the Company will be subject to compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant during, and continuing 30 days after, any period in which the Company s borrowing base availability falls below $25.0 million.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If the Company experiences a decline in revenues or adjusted EBITDA, the Company may have difficulty paying interest and principal amounts due on our ABL Facility or other indebtedness and meeting certain of the financial covenants contained in the ABL Facility.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If the Company is unable to make required payments under the ABL Facility, or if the Company fails to comply with the various covenants and other requirements of the ABL Facility or other indebtedness, the Company would be in default thereunder, which would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate the maturity thereof.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Any default under the ABL Facility or other indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s liquidity, business, operating results and financial condition and ability to make any dividend or other payments on the Company s capital stock.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P11_S5	If the Company is unable to successfully manage the frequent introduction of new products that satisfy changing consumer preferences, it could adversely impact its financial performance and prospects for future growth.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The Company s main products, like those of its competitors, generally have life cycles of two years or less, with sales occurring at a much higher rate in the first year than in the second.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Factors driving these short product life cycles include the rapid introduction of competitive products and quickly changing consumer preferences.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	In this marketplace, a substantial portion of the Company s annual revenues is generated each year by products that are in their first year of life.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	These marketplace conditions raise a number of issues that the Company must successfully manage.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	For example, the Company must properly anticipate consumer preferences and design products that meet those preferences while also complying with significant restrictions imposed by the Rules of Golf (see further discussion of the Rules of Golf below) or its new products will not achieve sufficient market success to compensate for the usual decline in sales experienced by products already in the market.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Second, the Company s research and development and supply chain groups face constant pressures to design, develop, source and supply new products that perform better than their predecessors many of which incorporate new or otherwise untested technology, suppliers or inputs.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Third, for new products to generate equivalent or greater revenues than their predecessors, they must either maintain the same or higher sales levels with the same or higher pricing, or exceed the performance of their predecessors in one or both of those areas.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Fourth, the relatively short window of opportunity for launching and selling new products requires great precision in forecasting demand and assuring that supplies are ready and delivered during the critical selling periods.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Should the Company not successfully manage all of the risks associated with this rapidly moving marketplace, the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be significantly adversely affected.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	A reduction in the number of rounds of golf played or in the number of golf participants could adversely affect the Company s sales.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Company generates substantially all of its revenues from the sale of golf-related products, including golf clubs, golf balls and golf accessories.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The demand for golf-related products in general, and golf balls in particular, is directly related to the number of golf participants and the number of rounds of golf being played by these participants.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If golf participation or the number of rounds of golf played decreases, sales of the Company s products may be adversely affected.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	In the future, the overall dollar volume of the market for golf-related products may not grow or may decline.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In addition, the demand for golf products is also directly related to the popularity of magazines, cable channels and other media dedicated to golf, television coverage of golf tournaments and attendance at golf events.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P15_S5	The Company depends on the exposure of its products through advertising and the media or at golf tournaments and events.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Any significant reduction in television coverage of, or attendance at, golf tournaments and events or any significant reduction in the popularity of golf magazines or golf channels, could reduce the visibility of the Company s brand and could adversely affect the Company s sales.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P15_S7	The Company may have limited opportunities for future growth in sales of golf clubs and golf balls.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P15_S8	In order for the Company to significantly grow its sales of golf clubs or golf balls, the Company must either increase its share of the market for golf clubs or balls, or the market for golf clubs or balls must grow.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P15_S9	The Company already has a significant share of worldwide sales of golf clubs and golf balls.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P15_S10	Therefore, opportunities for additional market share may be limited.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P15_S11	The Company also believes that overall dollar volume of the worldwide market for golf equipment sales has declined over the past three years.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P15_S12	In the future, the overall dollar volume of worldwide sales of golf clubs or golf balls may not grow or may continue to decline.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If the Company inaccurately forecasts demand for its products, it may manufacture either insufficient or excess quantities, which, in either case, could adversely affect its financial performance.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The Company plans its manufacturing capacity based upon the forecasted demand for its products.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The nature of the Company s business makes it difficult to quickly adjust its manufacturing capacity if actual demand for its products exceeds or is less than forecasted demand.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If actual demand for its products exceeds the forecasted demand, the Company may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of new products in time to fulfill actual demand, which could limit the Company s sales and adversely affect its financial performance.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P16_S4	On the other hand, if actual demand is less than the forecasted demand for its products, the Company could produce excess quantities, resulting in excess inventories and related obsolescence charges that could adversely affect the Company s financial performance.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P16_S5	The Company depends on single source or a limited number of suppliers for some of its products, and the loss of any of these suppliers could harm its business.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Company is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for its clubheads and shafts, some of which are single sourced.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Furthermore, some of the Company s products require specially developed manufacturing techniques and processes which make it difficult to identify and utilize alternative suppliers quickly.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, many of the Company s suppliers are not well capitalized and prolonged unfavorable economic conditions could increase the risk that they will go out of business.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If current suppliers are unable to deliver clubheads, shafts or other components, or if the Company is required to transition to other suppliers, the Company could experience significant production delays or disruption to its business.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P17_S4	The Company also depends on a single or a limited number of suppliers for the materials it uses to make its golf balls.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Any delay or interruption in such supplies could have a material adverse impact upon the Company s golf ball business.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If the Company did experience any such delays or interruptions, the Company may not be able to find adequate alternative suppliers at a reasonable cost or without significant disruption to its business.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	A significant disruption in the operations of the Company s golf club assembly and golf ball manufacturing and assembly facilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company s sales, profitability and results of operations.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	A significant amount of the Company s golf club products are assembled at the Company s facilities in Monterey, Mexico and a moderate amount of the Company s golf ball products are manufactured at its facilities in Chicopee, Massachusetts.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Both golf club and golf balls are shipped from third-party logistics facilities in Dallas, Texas and Toronto, Canada.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P18_S5	A significant disruption at any of the Company s golf club or golf ball manufacturing facilities or at the third-party logistics sites could adversely affect the Company s sales, profitability and results of operations.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P18_S6	If the Company is unable to obtain at reasonable costs materials or electricity necessary for the manufacture of its products, its business could be adversely affected.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The Company s size has made it a large consumer of certain materials, including steel, titanium alloys, carbon fiber and rubber.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The Company does not produce these materials itself, and must rely on its ability to obtain adequate supplies in the world marketplace in competition with other users of such materials.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In the future, the Company may not be able to obtain its requirements for such materials at a reasonable price or at all.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P19_S3	An interruption in the supply of the materials used by the Company or a significant change in costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The Company s golf club and golf ball manufacturing facilities use, among other resources, significant quantities of electricity to operate.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	An interruption in the supply of electricity or a significant increase in the cost of electricity could have a significant adverse effect upon the Company s results of operations.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	A disruption in the service or a significant increase in the cost of the Company s primary delivery and shipping services for its products and component parts could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The Company uses United Parcel Service ( UPS ) for substantially all ground shipments of products to its U.S. customers.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The Company uses air carriers and ocean shipping services for most of its international shipments of products.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Furthermore, many of the components the Company uses to build its golf clubs, including clubheads and shafts, are shipped to the Company via air carrier and ship services.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The Company s inbound and outbound shipments are particularly dependent upon air carrier facilities at Los Angeles International Airport and ship service facilities at the Port of Los Angeles (Long Beach).
837465_12_ITEM1A_P21_S4	If there is any significant interruption in service by such providers or at other significant airports or shipping ports, the Company may be unable to engage alternative suppliers or to receive or ship goods through alternate sites in order to deliver its products or components in a timely and cost-efficient manner.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P21_S5	As a result, the Company could experience manufacturing delays, increased manufacturing and shipping costs, and lost sales as a result of missed delivery deadlines and product demand cycles.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Any significant interruption in UPS services, air carrier services or ship services could have a material adverse effect upon the Company s business.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Furthermore, if the cost of delivery or shipping services were to increase significantly and the additional costs could not be covered by product pricing, the Company s operating results could be significantly adversely affected.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Company faces intense competition in each of its markets and if it is unable to maintain a competitive advantage, loss of market share, revenue, or profitability may result.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The golf club business is highly competitive, and is served by a number of well-established and well-financed companies with recognized brand names.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	New product introductions, price reductions, consignment sales, extended payment terms, closeouts, including closeouts of products that were recently commercially successful, and significant tour and advertising spending by competitors continue to generate intense market competition.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Furthermore, continued downward pressure on pricing in the market for new clubs could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s pre-owned club business as the gap narrows between the cost of a new club and a pre-owned club.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Successful marketing activities, discounted pricing, consignment sales, extended payment terms or new product introductions by competitors could negatively impact the Company s future sales.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The golf ball business is also highly competitive.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	There are a number of well-established and well-financed competitors, including one competitor with an estimated U.S. market share of over 50%.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	As the Company s competitors continue to incur significant costs in the areas of advertising, tour and other promotional support, the Company will continue to incur significant expenses in both tour and advertising support and product development.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Unless there is a change in competitive conditions, these competitive pressures and increased costs will continue to adversely affect the profitability of the Company s golf ball business.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The Company s accessories include golf bags, golf gloves, golf footwear, golf apparel and other items.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The Company faces significant competition in every region with respect to each of these product categories.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In most cases, the Company is not the market leader with respect to its accessory markets.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	The Company s golf ball business has a concentrated customer base.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P25_S4	The loss of one or more of the Company s top customers could have a significant negative impact on this business.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P25_S5	On a consolidated basis, no one customer that distributes golf clubs or golf balls in the United States accounted for more than 6% of the Company s consolidated revenues in 2011, 2010 and 2009.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P25_S6	On a segment basis, the golf ball customer base is much more concentrated than the golf club customer base.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P25_S7	In 2011, the top five golf ball customers accounted for approximately 22% of the Company s total consolidated golf ball sales.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P25_S8	A loss of one or more of these customers could have a significant adverse effect upon the Company s golf ball sales.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P25_S9	International political instability and terrorist activities may decrease demand for the Company s products and disrupt its business.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P25_S10	Terrorist activities and armed conflicts could have an adverse effect upon the United States or worldwide economy and could cause decreased demand for the Company s products as consumers attention and interest are diverted from golf and become focused on issues relating to these events.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P25_S11	If such events disrupt domestic or international air, ground or sea shipments, or the operation of the Company s manufacturing facilities, the Company s ability to obtain the materials necessary to manufacture its products and to deliver customer orders would be harmed, which would have a significant adverse affect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P25_S12	Such events can negatively impact tourism, which could adversely affect the Company s sales to retailers at resorts and other vacation destinations.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P25_S13	In addition, the occurrence of political instability and/or terrorist activities generally restricts travel to and from the affected areas, making it more difficult in general to manage the company s international operations.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P25_S14	The Company s business could be harmed by the occurrence of natural disasters or pandemic diseases.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P25_S15	The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, flood or hurricane, or the outbreak of a pandemic disease, could significantly adversely affect the Company s business.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	the components used to make the Company s products.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Demand for golf products also could be negatively affected as consumers in the affected regions restrict their recreational activities and as tourism to those areas declines.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	If the Company s suppliers experienced a significant disruption in their business as a result of a natural disaster or pandemic disease, the Company s ability to obtain the necessary components to make its products could be significantly adversely affected.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In addition, the occurrence of a natural disaster or the outbreak of a pandemic disease generally restricts the travel to and from the affected areas, making it more difficult in general to manage the Company s international operations.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P26_S4	The Company s business and operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could result in fluctuations in its operating results and stock price.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The Company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The Company s first quarter sales generally represent the Company s sell-in to the golf retail channel of its golf club products for the new golf season.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The Company s second and third quarter sales generally represent reorder business for golf clubs.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Sales of golf clubs during the second and third quarters are significantly affected not only by the sell-through of the Company s products that were sold into the channel during the first quarter but also by the sell-through of products by the Company s competitors.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Retailers are sometimes reluctant to reorder the Company s products in significant quantities when they already have excess inventory of products of the Company or its competitors.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The Company s sales of golf balls are generally associated with the level of rounds played in the areas where the Company s products are sold.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Therefore, golf ball sales tend to be greater in the second and third quarters, when the weather is good in most of the Company s key markets and rounds played are up.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Golf ball sales are also stimulated by product introductions as the retail channel takes on initial supplies.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Like golf clubs, reorders of golf balls depend on the rate of sell-through.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The Company s sales during the fourth quarter are generally significantly less than the other quarters because in many of the Company s principal markets fewer people are playing golf during that time of year due to cold weather.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Furthermore, the Company generally announces its new product line in the fourth quarter to allow retailers to plan for the new golf season.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Such early announcements of new products could cause golfers, and therefore the Company s customers, to defer purchasing additional golf equipment until the Company s new products are available.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Such deferments could have a material adverse effect upon sales of the Company s current products or result in closeout sales at reduced prices.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P29_S5	The seasonality of the Company s business could exacerbate the adverse effects of unusual or severe weather conditions on the Company s business.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Due to the seasonality of the Company s business, the Company s business can be significantly adversely affected by unusual or severe weather conditions.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Unfavorable weather conditions generally result in fewer golf rounds played, which generally results in reduced demand for all golf products, and in particular, golf balls.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Furthermore, catastrophic storms can negatively affect golf rounds played both during the storms and afterward, as storm damaged golf courses are repaired and golfers focus on repairing the damage to their homes, businesses and communities.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Consequently, sustained adverse weather conditions, especially during the warm weather months, could materially affect the Company s sales.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations and shareholders equity.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P30_S5	The Company s goodwill and intangible assets consist of goodwill from acquisitions, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, patents, and other intangible assets.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P30_S6	Accounting rules require that the Company s goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be evaluated for impairment at least annually.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P30_S7	In addition, accounting rules require that the Company s goodwill and intangible assets, including intangible assets with definite lives, be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P30_S8	Such indicators include a sustained decline in the Company s stock price or market capitalization, adverse changes in economic or market conditions or prospects, and changes in the Company s operations.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	An asset is considered to be impaired when its carrying value exceeds its fair value.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The Company determines the fair value of an asset based upon the discounted cash flows expected to be realized from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	If in conducting an impairment evaluation the Company were to determine that the carrying value of an asset exceeded its fair value, the Company would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P32_S2	If a significant amount of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets were deemed to be impaired, the Company s results of operations and shareholders equity would be significantly adversely affected.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P32_S3	The Company s ability to utilize all or a portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets may be limited significantly if the Company experiences an ownership change.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P32_S4	The Company has a significant amount of U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs ) and other losses.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P32_S5	The Company s ability to utilize the losses to offset future taxable income may be limited significantly if the Company were to experience an ownership change as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
837465_12_ITEM1A_P32_S6	In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in ownership of the Company s stock by 5-percent shareholders (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P32_S7	The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred for purposes of Section 382 is complex and requires significant judgment.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P32_S8	The extent to which the Company s ability to utilize the losses is limited as a result of such an ownership change depends on many variables, including the value of the Company s stock at the time of the ownership change.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P32_S9	Although the Company s ownership has changed significantly during the three-year period ended December 31, 2011 (due in significant part to the Company s June 2009 preferred stock offering), the Company does not believe there has been a cumulative increase in ownership in excess of 50 percentage points during that period.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P32_S10	The Company continues to monitor changes in ownership.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P32_S11	If such a cumulative increase did occur in any three year period and the Company were limited in the amount of losses it could use to offset taxable income, the Company s results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P32_S12	Changes in equipment standards under applicable Rules of Golf could adversely affect the Company s business.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P32_S13	The Company seeks to have its new golf club and golf ball products satisfy the standards published by the USGA and the R A in the Rules of Golf because these standards are generally followed by golfers, both professional and amateur, within their respective jurisdictions.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P32_S14	The USGA publishes rules that are generally followed in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and the R A publishes rules that are generally followed in most other countries throughout the world.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P32_S15	However, the Rules of Golf as published by the R A and the USGA are virtually the same, and are intended to be so pursuant to a Joint Statement of Principles issued in 2001.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	In the future, existing USGA and/or R A standards may be altered in ways that adversely affect the sales of the Company s current or future products.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	If a change in rules were adopted and caused one or more of the Company s current or future products to be nonconforming, the Company s sales of such products would be adversely affected.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The Company s sales could decline if professional golfers do not endorse or use the Company s products.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The Company establishes relationships with professional golfers in order to evaluate and promote Callaway Golf, Odyssey and Top-Flite branded products.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The Company has entered into endorsement arrangements with members of the various professional tours, including the Champions Tour, the PGA Tour, the LPGA Tour, the PGA European Tour, the Japan Golf Tour and the Nationwide Tour.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	While most professional golfers fulfill their contractual obligations, some have been known to stop using a sponsor s products despite contractual commitments.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	If certain of the Company s professional endorsers were to stop using the Company s products contrary to their endorsement agreements, the Company s business could be adversely affected in a material way by the negative publicity or lack of endorsement.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The Company believes that professional usage of its golf clubs and golf balls contributes to retail sales.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	The Company therefore spends a significant amount of money to secure professional usage of its products.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Many other companies, however, also aggressively seek the patronage of these professionals and offer many inducements, including significant cash incentives and specially designed products.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	There is a great deal of competition to secure the representation of tour professionals.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	As a result, it is expensive to attract and retain such tour professionals.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P37_S2	The inducements offered by other companies could result in a decrease in usage of the Company s products by professional golfers or limit the Company s ability to attract other tour professionals.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P37_S3	A decline in the level of professional usage of the Company s products could have a material adverse effect on the Company s sales and business.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Failure to adequately enforce the Company s intellectual property rights could adversely affect its business.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The golf club industry, in general, has been characterized by widespread imitation of popular club designs.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The Company has an active program of monitoring, investigating and enforcing its proprietary rights against companies and individuals who market or manufacture counterfeits and knockoff products.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The Company asserts its rights against infringers of its copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade dress.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	However, these efforts may not be successful in reducing sales of golf products by these infringers.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Additionally, other golf club manufacturers may be able to produce successful golf clubs which imitate the Company s designs without infringing any of the Company s copyrights, patents, trademarks, or trade dress.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P39_S4	The failure to prevent or limit such infringers or imitators could adversely affect the Company s reputation and sales.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P39_S5	The Company may become subject to intellectual property suits that could cause it to incur significant costs or pay significant damages or that could prohibit it from selling its products.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P39_S6	The Company s competitors also seek to obtain patent, trademark, copyright or other protection of their proprietary rights and designs for golf clubs and golf balls.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P39_S7	From time to time, third parties have claimed or may claim in the future that the Company s products infringe upon their proprietary rights.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P39_S8	The Company evaluates any such claims and, where appropriate, has obtained or sought to obtain licenses or other business arrangements.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P39_S9	To date, there have been no significant interruptions in the Company s business as a result of any claims of infringement.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P39_S10	However, in the future, intellectual property claims could force the Company to alter its existing products or withdraw them from the market or could delay the introduction of new products.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Various patents have been issued to the Company s competitors in the golf industry and these competitors may assert that the Company s golf products infringe their patent or other proprietary rights.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	If the Company s golf products are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights, the Company may be unable to obtain a license to use such technology, and it could incur substantial costs to redesign its products or to defend legal actions.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The Company s brands may be damaged by the actions of its licensees.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The Company licenses its trademarks to third-party licensees who produce, market and sell their products bearing the Company s trademarks.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The Company chooses its licensees carefully and imposes upon such licensees various restrictions on the products, and on the manner, on which such trademarks may be used.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	In addition, the Company requires its licensees to abide by certain standards of conduct and the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P42_S3	However, if a licensee fails to adhere to these requirements, the Company s brands could be damaged.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P42_S4	The Company s brands could also be damaged if a licensee becomes insolvent or by any negative publicity concerning a licensee or if the licensee does not maintain good relationships with its customers or consumers, many of which are also the Company s customers and consumers.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P42_S5	Sales of the Company s products by unauthorized retailers or distributors could adversely affect the Company s authorized distribution channels and harm the Company s reputation.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P42_S6	Some of the Company s products find their way to unauthorized outlets or distribution channels.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	On the other hand, stopping such commerce could result in a potential decrease in sales to those customers who are selling the Company s products to unauthorized distributors or an increase in sales returns over historical levels.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	While the Company has taken some lawful steps to limit commerce of its products in the gray market in both the United States and abroad, it has not stopped such commerce.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The Company has significant international operations and is exposed to risks associated with doing business globally.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The Company s management believes that controlling the distribution of its products in certain major markets in the world has been and will be an element in the future growth and success of the Company.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The Company sells and distributes its products directly in many key international markets in Europe, Asia, North America and elsewhere around the world.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	These activities have resulted and will continue to result in investments in inventory, accounts receivable, employees, corporate infrastructure and facilities.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P45_S2	In addition, there are a limited number of suppliers of golf club components in the United States, and the Company has increasingly become more reliant on suppliers and vendors located outside of the United States.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P45_S3	The operation of foreign distribution in the Company s international markets, as well as the management of relationships with international suppliers and vendors, will continue to require the dedication of management and other Company resources.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The Company manufactures most of its products outside of the United States.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P46_S1	As a result of this international business, the Company is exposed to increased risks inherent in conducting business outside of the United States.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P46_S2	In addition to foreign currency risks, these risks include:
837465_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Increased exposure to interruptions in air carrier or ship services.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Any significant adverse change in circumstances or conditions could have a significant adverse effect upon the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P48_S2	We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The Company relies on increasingly complex information systems for management of its manufacturing, distribution, sales and other functions.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	If the Company s information systems fail to perform these functions adequately or if the Company experiences an interruption in their operation, including a breach in cyber security, its business and results of operations could suffer.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	All of the Company s major operations, including manufacturing, distribution, sales and accounting, are dependent upon the Company s complex information systems.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P50_S1	The Company s information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:
837465_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Hackers, computer viruses, software bugs or glitches.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Any damage or significant disruption in the operation of such systems or the failure of the Company s information systems to perform as expected could disrupt the Company s business, result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess inventory and product shortages and otherwise adversely affect the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Unauthorized access to, or accidental disclosure of, consumer personally-identifiable information that the Company collects through its websites may result in significant expenses and negatively impact our reputation and business.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	There is growing concern over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P52_S1	While the Company has implemented security measures, the Company s computer systems may be susceptible to electronic or physical computer break-ins, viruses and other disruptions and security breaches.
837465_12_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally-identifiable information regarding visitors to the Company s websites or otherwise, whether through a breach of the Company s network by an unauthorized party, employee theft, misuse or error or otherwise, could harm the Company s reputation, impair the Company s ability to attract website visitors, or subject the Company to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by consumers, and adversely affect the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.

837465_12_ITEM5_P1_S1	The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and quarterly determinations that cash dividends are in the best interests of its stockholders.
837465_12_ITEM5_P1_S2	Future dividends may be affected by, among other items, the Company s views on potential future capital requirements, projected cash flows and needs, changes to our business model and certain restrictions limiting dividends imposed by the Company s credit facility (see Item 7 Sources of Liquidity below).
837465_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	Performance Graph The following graph presents a comparison of the cumulative total shareholder return of the Company s common stock since December 31, 2006 to two indices: the Standard Poor s 500 Index ( S P 500 ) and the Standard Poor s 600 Smallcap Index ( S P 600 ).
837465_12_ITEM5_P2_S1	The S P 500 tracks the aggregate price performance of equity securities of 500 large-cap companies that are actively traded in the U.S., and is considered to be a leading indicator of U.S. equity securities.
837465_12_ITEM5_P2_S2	The S P 600 is a market value-weighted index that tracks the aggregate price performance of equity securities from a broad range of small-cap stocks traded in the U.S.
837465_12_ITEM5_P2_S3	The graph assumes an initial investment of $100 at December 31, 2006 and reinvestment of all dividends in ELY stock on the dividend payable date.
837465_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	The Callaway Golf Company index is based upon the closing prices of Callaway Golf Company common stock on December 31, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 of $14.41, $17.43, $9.29, $7.54, $8.07 and $5.53, respectively.

837465_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the related notes and the Important Notice to Investors that appear elsewhere in this report.
837465_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations, financial condition and liquidity are based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
837465_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, shareholders equity, sales and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
837465_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
837465_12_ITEM7_P1_S3	Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
837465_12_ITEM7_P1_S4	On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business and new information as it becomes available.
837465_12_ITEM7_P1_S5	Management believes the critical accounting policies discussed below affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
837465_12_ITEM7_P1_S6	For a complete discussion of all of the Company s significant accounting policies, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, as products are shipped to customers, net of an allowance for sales returns and accruals for sales programs.
837465_12_ITEM7_P1_S7	The Company records a reserve for anticipated returns through a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the period that the related sales are recorded.
837465_12_ITEM7_P1_S8	Sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through of products.
837465_12_ITEM7_P1_S9	In addition, from time to time, the Company offers sales programs that allow for specific returns.
837465_12_ITEM7_P1_S10	The Company records a reserve for anticipated returns related to these sales programs based on the terms of the sales program as well as historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through of products.
837465_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Historically, the Company s actual sales returns have not been materially different from management s original estimates.
837465_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance for sales returns.
837465_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	However, if the actual costs of sales returns are significantly different than the recorded estimated allowance, the Company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
837465_12_ITEM7_P2_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the recorded estimated allowance for 2011 sales returns, pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have been increased by approximately $3.5 million.
837465_12_ITEM7_P2_S4	The Company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings.
837465_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program, management s forecast of future product demand, and historical customer participation in similar programs.
837465_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Company s primary sales program, the Preferred Retailer Program, offers longer payment terms during the initial sell in period, as well as potential rebates and discounts, for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the Company, including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels, prime product placement and retailer staff training.
837465_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	Under this program, qualifying retailers can earn either discounts or rebates based upon the amount of product purchased.
837465_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	Discounts are applied and recorded at the time of sale.
837465_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	For rebates, the Company accrues an estimate of the rebate at the time of sale based on the customer s estimated qualifying current year product purchases.
837465_12_ITEM7_P4_S4	The estimate is based on the historical level of purchases, adjusted for any factors expected to affect the current year purchase levels.
837465_12_ITEM7_P4_S5	The estimated year-end rebate is adjusted quarterly based on actual purchase levels, as necessary.
837465_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Preferred Retailer Program is generally short term in nature and the actual costs of the program are known as of the end of the year and paid to customers shortly after year-end.
837465_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	which are also generally short term in nature.
837465_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Historically the Company s actual costs related to its Preferred Retailer Program and other sales programs have not been materially different than its estimates.
837465_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed.
837465_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	In addition, the Company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws.
837465_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	The Company s gift cards have no expiration.
837465_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	To determine when redemption is remote, the Company analyzes an aging of unredeemed cards (based on the date the card was last used or the activation date if the card has never been used) and compares that information with historical redemption trends.
837465_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to determine the timing of recognition of gift card revenues.
837465_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	However, if the Company is not able to accurately determine when gift card redemption is remote, the Company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
837465_12_ITEM7_P9_S3	The deferred revenue associated with outstanding gift cards decreased from $3.2 million at December 31, 2010 to $2.0 million at December 31, 2011.
837465_12_ITEM7_P9_S4	Revenues from course credits in connection with the use of the Company s uPro GPS on-course range finders are deferred when purchased and recognized when customers download the course credits for usage.
837465_12_ITEM7_P9_S5	Deferred revenue associated with unused course credits remained constant at $2.6 million at both December 31, 2011 and 2010.
837465_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments.
837465_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	An estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, the customer s financial condition and current economic trends, all of which are subject to change.
837465_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	If the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance, the Company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected.
837465_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the 2011 recorded estimated allowance for doubtful accounts, pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have been increased by approximately $0.7 million.
837465_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value.
837465_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
837465_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	The inventory balance, which includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs, is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory.
837465_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	The estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon current inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience as well as management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand, all of which are subject to change.
837465_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	The calculation of the Company s allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand and pricing, regulatory (USGA and R A) rule changes, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence.
837465_12_ITEM7_P13_S3	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance.
837465_12_ITEM7_P13_S4	However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner, the Company may need to increase its inventory allowance, which could significantly adversely affect the Company s operating results.
837465_12_ITEM7_P13_S5	Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the 2011 recorded estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory, pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have been increased by approximately $1.7 million.
837465_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company acquires tangible and intangible assets.
837465_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable or exceeds its fair value.
837465_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining the amount of undiscounted cash flows directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, the timing of the impairment test, and the asset s residual value, if any.
837465_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	To determine fair value, the Company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate.
837465_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the asset and a charge to earnings.
837465_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	The Company uses its best judgment based on current facts and circumstances related to its business when making these estimates.
837465_12_ITEM7_P16_S3	However, if actual results are not consistent with the Company s estimates and assumptions used in calculating future cash flows and asset fair values, the Company may be exposed to losses that could be material.
837465_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the fair values of the Company s reporting units in the U.S., United Kingdom, Canada and Korea, as well as the fair value of certain trade names and trademarks substantially exceeded their carrying values.
837465_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	However, during the second quarter of 2011, the Company determined that the discounted expected cash flows from trade names, trademarks and other intangible assets the Company acquired in 2003 as part of the acquisition of the assets of TFGC Estate, Inc. (f/k/a The Top-Flite Golf Company) were $5.4 million less than the carrying value of those assets.
837465_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $5.4 million to reduce the carrying value of these assets.
837465_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company conducted an impairment test on goodwill related to its reporting unit in Australia.
837465_12_ITEM7_P17_S4	In completing the impairment analysis, the Company determined that the discounted expected cash flows from this subsidiary were $1.1 million less than the subsidiary s net book value including goodwill.
837465_12_ITEM7_P17_S5	As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million to write-off the goodwill balance.
837465_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	The Company has a stated two-year warranty policy for its golf clubs.
837465_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	The Company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded.
837465_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	In estimating its future warranty obligations, the Company considers various relevant factors, including the Company s stated warranty policies and practices, the historical frequency of claims, and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty.
837465_12_ITEM7_P18_S3	The Company s estimates for calculating the warranty reserve are principally based on assumptions regarding the warranty costs of each club product line over the expected warranty period.
837465_12_ITEM7_P18_S4	Where little or no claims experience may exist, the Company s warranty obligation calculation is based upon long-term historical warranty rates of similar products until sufficient data is available.
837465_12_ITEM7_P18_S5	As actual model-specific rates become available, the Company s estimates are modified to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes.
837465_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Historically, the Company s actual warranty claims have not been materially different from management s original estimated warranty obligation.
837465_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the warranty obligation.
837465_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	However, if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims significantly exceeds the estimated warranty reserve, the Company may be exposed to losses that could be material.
837465_12_ITEM7_P19_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the 2011 recorded estimated allowance for warranty obligations, pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have been increased by approximately $0.8 million.
837465_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Income Taxes Current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year.
837465_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	of an asset or liability computed pursuant to ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
837465_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	In accordance with the applicable accounting rules, the Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed it to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
837465_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire.
837465_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment, including estimates of future taxable income.
837465_12_ITEM7_P22_S3	These estimates are based on the Company s best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions.
837465_12_ITEM7_P22_S4	As a result of the Company s evaluation during 2011, the Company recorded a $52.5 million increase to income tax expense in order to establish a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_12_ITEM7_P22_S5	In addition, the Company has discontinued recognizing income tax benefits related to its U.S. net operating losses until it is determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefits from its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_12_ITEM7_P22_S6	For further information, see Note 16 Income Taxes to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Pursuant to ASC Topic 740-25-6, the Company is required to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is deemed to be more likely than not that the Company would be required to pay such additional taxes.
837465_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	The Company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions.
837465_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	The preparation of these income tax returns requires the Company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by the Company.
837465_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	The Company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability, including interest and penalties, for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return.
837465_12_ITEM7_P23_S3	The Company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available.
837465_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	Historically, additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the Company s uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the Company s expectations.
837465_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	Information regarding income taxes is contained in Note 16 Income Taxes to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
837465_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	Share-based Compensation The Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values.
837465_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	ASC Topic 718 further requires a reduction in share-based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	The forfeiture rate used by the Company is based on historical forfeiture trends.
837465_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	If actual forfeitures are not consistent with the Company s estimates, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods.
837465_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options and stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) at the date of grant.
837465_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the Company s expected stock price volatility, the expected dividend yield, the expected life of an option or SAR and the risk-free rate, which is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option or SAR.
837465_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected price volatility and the expected option or SAR life.
837465_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	The Company uses forecasted dividends to estimate the expected dividend yield.
837465_12_ITEM7_P27_S4	The Company believes a forecasted calculation is more appropriate than using historical data since the amount of dividends paid have decreased beginning in 2009.
837465_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	Changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option or SAR.
837465_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option or SAR does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee.
837465_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for stock options.
837465_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	vesting period based on an estimated fair value, which is remeasured each reporting period.
837465_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	Once vested, the SARs continued to be remeasured to fair value until they are exercised.
837465_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	The Company records compensation expense for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (collectively restricted stock ) based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
837465_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	The estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares awarded.
837465_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, reduced by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Phantom stock units ( PSUs ) are a form of share-based awards that are indexed to the Company s stock and are settled in cash.
837465_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	As such, these awards are classified as liabilities.
837465_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	Because phantom stock units are settled in cash, compensation expense recognized over the vesting period will vary based on changes in fair value.
837465_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	Fair value is remeasured at the end of each interim reporting period through the settlement date of the awards and is based on the closing price of the Company s stock.
837465_12_ITEM7_P33_S2	Recent Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by this reference.
837465_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Results of Operations Overview of Business and Seasonality The Company designs, manufactures and sells high quality golf clubs and golf balls and also sells golf apparel, golf footwear, golf bags, gloves, eyewear and other golf-related accessories, including uPro GPS on-course measurement devices.
837465_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Company designs its products to be technologically advanced and in this regard invests a considerable amount in research and development each year.
837465_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	The Company s golf products are designed for golfers of all skill levels, both amateur and professional.
837465_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	The Company has two operating segments that are organized on the basis of products, namely the golf clubs segment and golf balls segment.
837465_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	The golf clubs segment consists primarily of Callaway Golf and Top-Flite woods, hybrids, irons, wedges and putters as well as Odyssey putters.
837465_12_ITEM7_P36_S3	This segment also includes other golf-related accessories described above and royalties from licensing of the Company s trademarks and service marks as well as sales of pre-owned golf clubs.
837465_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	The golf balls segment consists primarily of Callaway Golf and Top-Flite golf balls.
837465_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	As discussed in Note 19 Segment Information to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company s operating segments exclude a significant amount of corporate general administrative expenses and other income (expense) not utilized by management in determining segment profitability.
837465_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	In most of the regions where the Company does business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis.
837465_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	Weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year-round, except in a few markets, with many of the Company s on-course customers closing for the cold weather months.
837465_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	The Company s business is therefore also subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_12_ITEM7_P39_S3	In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season.
837465_12_ITEM7_P39_S4	This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter.
837465_12_ITEM7_P39_S5	The Company s second quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter.
837465_12_ITEM7_P39_S6	The Company s third quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but are generally less than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season.
837465_12_ITEM7_P39_S7	The Company s fourth quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company s key markets.
837465_12_ITEM7_P39_S8	However, fourth quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year.
837465_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	factors, including the timing of new product introductions.
837465_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	In general, however, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company s sales and most, if not all, of its profitability generally occurs during the first half of the year.
837465_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	Over half of the Company s business is conducted outside of the United States and is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
837465_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	As a result, changes in foreign currency rates can have a significant effect on the Company s financial results.
837465_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	The Company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates.
837465_12_ITEM7_P41_S3	While these foreign currency exchange contracts can mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates, they do not eliminate those effects, which can be significant.
837465_12_ITEM7_P41_S4	These effects include (i) the translation of results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, (ii) the mark-to-market adjustments of certain intercompany balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies, and (iii) the mark-to-market adjustments on the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts.
837465_12_ITEM7_P41_S5	In general, the Company s overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts its business.
837465_12_ITEM7_P41_S6	As a result of the continued weakening trend of the U.S. dollar in 2011, the translation of foreign currency exchange rates had a net positive impact on the Company s financial results during year ended 2011.
837465_12_ITEM7_P41_S7	Executive Summary The Company s 2011 results reflect the impact of a challenging golf market as well as an unfavorable shift in the competitive landscape driven by the success of certain competitor products launched during the year.
837465_12_ITEM7_P41_S8	These factors, combined with the absence of a fourth quarter woods launch by the Company and the negative impact of natural disasters in Japan, Australia and South East Asia, resulted in an 8% decline in sales and a 300 basis point decline in gross margins with relatively flat operating expenses in 2011 compared to 2010.
837465_12_ITEM7_P41_S9	These declines were partially offset by the positive effects of changes in foreign currency rates on sales and gross margins during the period as well as savings from the Company s ongoing gross margin initiatives and current year restructuring initiatives, as discussed below in more detail.
837465_12_ITEM7_P41_S10	Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased to $171.8 million compared to $18.8 million in the comparable period of 2010.
837465_12_ITEM7_P41_S11	Diluted loss per share increased to $2.82 in 2011 compared to $0.46 in 2010.
837465_12_ITEM7_P41_S12	The Company s net loss for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 include the following charges:
837465_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	(1) The Company s income tax provision for 2011 includes charges of $52.5 million related to the establishment of a valuation allowance against its U.S deferred tax assets, and $21.6 million related to the recognition of certain prepaid tax expenses on intercompany profits.
837465_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	See Note 16 Income Taxes to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. In June 2011, as a result of the Company s performance, the Company announced a restructuring plan (the Reorganization and Reinvestment Initiatives ) that involved personnel changes at all levels of the organization and a reevaluation of business processes.
837465_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	The restructuring was designed to deliver annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $50 million with the Company reinvesting approximately half that amount in brand and marketing initiatives for 2012.
837465_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	During 2011, the Company completed substantially all of the personnel changes and has reorganized the Company to provide for increased focus on the different product categories and regions of the Company s business with the intent to achieve sustained profitability in each area.
837465_12_ITEM7_P42_S4	The Company is on track to achieve the $50 million annual savings target communicated last June and has begun investing a significant portion of those savings in the Company s newly developed 2012 globally integrated brand and marketing initiatives.
837465_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Management believes it is making the changes that are necessary to take the Company back to a strong leadership position in the golf equipment industry and that the increased investment in brand and demand creation initiatives will generate higher sales which together with savings from its Reorganization and Reinvestment Initiatives, the continued strength of the Company s brands in the marketplace, the new technology embedded in the Company s 2012 products, and anticipated increased efficiency in its supply and distribution operations resulting from the completion of the Company s Global Operations Strategy Initiatives (the GOS Initiatives ) this year should result in much improved 2012 financial performance for the Company.
837465_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $81.2 million (8%) to $886.5 million compared to $967.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
837465_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	This decrease was due to a decline in sales in the golf clubs and golf balls segments, as noted below (dollars in millions):
837465_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	(1) Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
837465_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	For further discussion of each operating segment s results, see Golf Club and Golf Ball Segments Results below.
837465_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Net sales information by region is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	Net sales in the United States decreased $48.8 million (10%) to $419.4 million during 2011 compared to 2010.
837465_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	This decrease was primarily due to the timing of planned product launches as well as an unfavorable shift in the competitive landscape driven by the success of certain competitor products launched in 2011.
837465_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	The Company s sales in regions outside of the United States decreased $32.4 million (6%) to $467.1 million during 2011 compared to the prior year.
837465_12_ITEM7_P46_S3	This decrease was largely caused by an unfavorable shift in the competitive landscape combined with the natural disasters in Japan, Australia and in South East Asia in 2011.
837465_12_ITEM7_P46_S4	These decreases were partially offset by increases in sales in Europe and in some of the Company s emerging markets (China and India).
837465_12_ITEM7_P46_S5	The Company s reported net sales in regions outside the United States during 2011 were favorably affected by the translation of foreign currency sales into U.S. dollars based upon 2011 exchange rates.
837465_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	If 2010 rates were applied to 2011 reported sales in regions outside the U.S. and all other factors were held constant, net sales in such regions would have been $29.0 million less than the net sales reported for 2011.
837465_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	Gross profit decreased $54.2 million to $311.3 million in 2011 from $365.5 million in 2010.
837465_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	Gross profit as a percentage of net sales ( gross margin ) decreased to 35% in 2011 compared to 38% in 2010.
837465_12_ITEM7_P47_S3	The decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease in production volumes which resulted in unfavorable absorption of fixed costs, (ii) the recognition of certain costs in connection with the final phase of the Company s GOS Initiatives, and (iii) a decline in sales in Japan which generally have the highest gross margins of the Company s sales.
837465_12_ITEM7_P47_S4	These decreases were partially offset by (i) cost reductions on golf club components costs as well as reductions on club conversion costs primarily related to the Company s GOS Initiatives, (ii) a reduction of closeout activity across most product categories, and (iii) favorable changes in foreign currency in 2011.
837465_12_ITEM7_P47_S5	See Segment Profitability below for further discussion of gross margins.
837465_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	Selling expenses increased by $8.0 million to $265.3 million (30% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $257.3 million (27% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2010.
837465_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	The dollar increase was primarily due to increases of $5.8 million in advertising and promotional activities and $5.1 million in charges related to the Company s Reorganization and Reinvestment Initiatives, partially offset by a decrease of $4.8 million in employee costs.
837465_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	General and administrative expenses decreased by $5.7 million to $92.8 million (10% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $98.4 million (10% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2010.
837465_12_ITEM7_P48_S3	This decrease was primarily due to a reduction of $8.8 million in employee related expenses and a $6.2 million net gain recognized in connection with the sale of three of the Company s buildings in March 2011.
837465_12_ITEM7_P48_S4	These decreases were partially offset by charges of $9.4 million related to the Company s Reorganization and Reinvestment Initiatives.
837465_12_ITEM7_P48_S5	Research and development expenses decreased by $2.1 million to $34.3 million (4% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $36.4 million (4% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2010 primarily due to a reduction of $1.4 million in employee related charges.
837465_12_ITEM7_P48_S6	Other expense decreased by $2.9 million to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $11.0 million in the comparable period of 2010.
837465_12_ITEM7_P48_S7	This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net foreign currency hedging losses.
837465_12_ITEM7_P48_S8	The Company s provision for income taxes totaled $81.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to an income tax benefit of $16.8 million in the comparable period of 2010.
837465_12_ITEM7_P48_S9	In 2011, the Company recorded tax expense of $52.5 million in order to establish a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets, which also resulted in the recognition of certain prepaid tax expenses of $21.6 million related to intercompany profits.
837465_12_ITEM7_P48_S10	The Company recognized income tax expense despite pre-tax losses in 2011 due to the impacts of (i) the establishment of a valuation allowance against net U.S. deferred tax assets, (ii) the recognition of prepaid tax expenses, and (iii) the recognition of tax expense calculated on foreign pre-tax income.
837465_12_ITEM7_P48_S11	Due to the effects of its deferred tax asset valuation allowance, the Company s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 is not comparable to the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 as the Company s income tax amount is not directly correlated to the amount of its pre-tax income.
837465_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased to $171.8 million compared to $18.8 million in the comparable period of 2010.
837465_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	Diluted loss per share increased to $2.82 in 2011 compared to $0.46 in 2010.
837465_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	The Company s net loss for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 include the following charges:
837465_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	(1) The Company s income tax provision for 2011 includes charges of $52.5 million related to the establishment of a valuation allowance against its U.S deferred tax assets, and $21.6 million related to the recognition of certain prepaid tax expenses on intercompany profits.
837465_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	See Note 16 Income Taxes to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. Golf Clubs and Golf Balls Segments Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 Golf Clubs Segment Net sales information for the golf clubs segment by product category is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	(1) Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
837465_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	The $12.3 million (5%) decrease in net sales of woods to $212.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily due to a decrease in sales volume partially offset by an increase in average selling prices.
837465_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	The decrease in sales volume was primarily due to the earlier launch timing of the 2011 Diablo Octane drivers and fairway woods, which were launched early in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the prior year launch of Diablo Edge drivers and fairway woods during the first quarter of 2010.
837465_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	Additionally sales volumes were negatively impacted by the natural disasters in Japan, Australia and South East Asia during 2011.
837465_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	The increase in average selling prices was primarily due to a favorable shift in product mix from sales of moderately priced drivers and fairway woods in 2010 to sales of more premium drivers in 2011 combined with less closeout activity during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the prior year.
837465_12_ITEM7_P52_S4	The $16.1 million (7%) decrease in net sales of irons to $207.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily attributable to a decline in sales volume partially offset by an increase in average selling prices.
837465_12_ITEM7_P52_S5	The decline in sales volume was primarily due to fewer new irons models launched in 2011 compared to the prior year.
837465_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	and South East Asia during 2011 as well as a push in 2010 to sell irons and wedges which became nonconforming in 2011.
837465_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	The increase in average selling prices primarily resulted from the current year launch of the more premium Razr X irons compared to the prior year launch of the more moderately priced Big Bertha Diablo irons and the value-priced X-24 Hot and X-20 NG irons.
837465_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	The $17.5 million (16%) decrease in net sales of putters to $88.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily attributable to a decline in sales volume partially offset by an increase in average selling prices.

837465_12_ITEM7_P80_S17	The Company s inventory balance also fluctuates throughout the year as a result of the general seasonality of the Company s business.
837465_12_ITEM7_P80_S18	Generally, the Company s buildup of inventory levels begins during the fourth quarter and continues heavily into the first quarter as well as into the beginning of the second quarter in order to meet demand during the height of the golf season.
837465_12_ITEM7_P80_S19	Inventory levels start to decline toward the end of the second quarter and are at their lowest during the third quarter.
837465_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	The Company s net inventory decreased $35.5 million to $233.1 million as of December 31, 2011 compared to $268.6 million as of December 31, 2010.
837465_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	This decrease was driven primarily by the later timing of new product launches planned for 2012 as well as a reduction in out of catalog products resulting from improved product life-cycle management processes.
837465_12_ITEM7_P81_S2	Net inventories as a percentage of the trailing twelve months net sales decreased to 26.3% as of December 31, 2011 compared to 27.8% as of December 31, 2010.
837465_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity The Company s has a Loan and Security Agreement with Bank of America N.A. (as amended, the ABL Facility ) which provides a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility of up to $230.0 million, comprised of a $158.3 million U.S. facility (of which $20.0 million is available for letters of credit), a $31.7 million Canadian facility (of which $5.0 million is available for letters of credit) and a $40.0 million United Kingdom facility (of which $2.0 million is available for letters of credit), in each case subject to borrowing base availability under the applicable facility.
837465_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	Borrowing under the U.K. facility will be permitted upon satisfaction of customary conditions relating to delivery of U.K. collateral security documents.
837465_12_ITEM7_P82_S2	The aggregate amount outstanding under the Company s letters of credit was $0.5 million at December 31, 2011.
837465_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	The amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are secured by certain assets, including inventory and accounts receivable, of the Company s U.S., Canadian and U.K. legal entities.
837465_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility and had $43.0 million of cash and cash equivalents.
837465_12_ITEM7_P83_S2	Generally, during the first quarter, the Company will rely more heavily on its credit facilities to fund operations as cash inflows from operations begin to increase during the second and third quarters as a result of cash collections from customers.
837465_12_ITEM7_P83_S3	The maximum amount of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness, including borrowings under the ABL Facility, that could have been outstanding on December 31, 2011, was approximately $87.7 million.
837465_12_ITEM7_P83_S4	Average outstanding borrowings during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 were $25.1 million.
837465_12_ITEM7_P83_S5	Amounts borrowed under the ABL Facility may be repaid and borrowed as needed.
837465_12_ITEM7_P83_S6	The entire outstanding principal amount (if any) is due and payable at maturity on June 30, 2016.
837465_12_ITEM7_P83_S7	The interest rate applicable to outstanding loans under the ABL Facility fluctuates depending on the Company s trailing-twelve month EBITDA (as defined by the ABL Facility) combined with the Company s availability ratio (as defined below).
837465_12_ITEM7_P83_S8	At December 31, 2011, the Company s interest rate applicable to its outstanding loans under the ABL Facility was 4.75%.
837465_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	The Company s availability ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of (a) the average daily availability under the ABL Facility to (b) the sum of the Canadian, the U.K. and the U.S. borrowing bases, as adjusted.
837465_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	All applicable margins will be permanently reduced by 0.25% if EBITDA, as defined in the ABL Facility, meets or exceeds $25.0 million over any trailing twelve-month period, and will be permanently reduced by an additional 0.25% if EBITDA meets or exceeds $50.0 million over any trailing twelve-month period.
837465_12_ITEM7_P84_S2	In addition, the ABL Facility provides for monthly fees ranging from 0.375% to 0.5% of the unused portion of the ABL Facility, depending on the prior month s average daily balance of revolver loans and stated amount of letters of credit relative to lenders commitments.
837465_12_ITEM7_P84_S3	The ABL Facility includes certain restrictions including, among other things, restrictions on incurrence of additional debt, liens, dividends and other restricted payments, asset sales, investments, mergers, acquisitions and affiliate transactions.
837465_12_ITEM7_P84_S4	Additionally, the Company will be subject to compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant during, and continuing 30 days after, any period in which the Company s borrowing base availability falls below $25.0 million.
837465_12_ITEM7_P84_S5	As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the ABL Facility.
837465_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	The origination fees incurred in connection with the ABL Facility as of December 31, 2011 totaled $3.2 million, which are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, and will be amortized into interest expense over the term of the ABL Facility agreement.
837465_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	Unamortized origination fees were $2.9 million as of December 31, 2011, of which $0.6 million was included in other current assets and $2.3 million in other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
837465_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	In November 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized it to repurchase shares of its common stock in the open market or in private transactions, subject to the Company s assessment of market conditions and buying opportunities, up to a maximum cost to the Company of $100.0 million, which would remain in effect until completed or otherwise terminated by the Board of Directors (the November 2007 repurchase program ).
837465_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	The November 2007 repurchase program supersedes all prior stock repurchase authorizations.
837465_12_ITEM7_P86_S2	During 2011, the Company repurchased approximately 227,000 shares of its common stock under the November 2007 repurchase program at an average cost per share of $6.99 for a total cost of $1.6 million.
837465_12_ITEM7_P86_S3	The Company acquired these shares to satisfy the Company s tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting and settlement of employee restricted stock unit awards.
837465_12_ITEM7_P86_S4	The Company s repurchases of shares of common stock are recorded at cost and result in a reduction of shareholders equity.
837465_12_ITEM7_P86_S5	As of December 31, 2011, the Company remained authorized to repurchase up to an additional $73.6 million of its common stock under this program.
837465_12_ITEM7_P86_S6	The following table summarizes certain significant cash obligations as of December 31, 2011 that will affect the Company s future liquidity (in millions):
837465_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	(1) During the normal course of its business, the Company enters into agreements to purchase goods and services, including purchase commitments for production materials, endorsement agreements with professional golfers and other endorsers, employment and consulting agreements, and intellectual property licensing agreements pursuant to which the Company is required to pay royalty fees.
837465_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	It is not possible to determine the amounts the Company will ultimately be required to pay under these agreements as they are subject to many variables including performance-based bonuses, reductions in payment obligations if designated minimum performance criteria are not achieved, and severance arrangements.
837465_12_ITEM7_P87_S2	The amounts listed approximate minimum purchase obligations, base compensation, and guaranteed minimum royalty payments the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements.
837465_12_ITEM7_P87_S3	The actual amounts paid under some of these agreements may be higher or lower than the amounts included.
837465_12_ITEM7_P87_S4	In the aggregate, the actual amount paid under these obligations is likely to be higher than the amounts listed as a result of the variable nature of these obligations.
837465_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	The Company also enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders or other documentation or that are undocumented except for an invoice.
837465_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected in this line item.
837465_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	In addition, the Company has made contractual commitments to each of its officers and certain other employees providing for severance payments upon the termination of employment.
837465_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	(2) The amounts included in the table above represent the Company s total commitment to pay preferred dividends through June 15, 2012 should it opt to mandatorily convert or redeem any preferred stock.
837465_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	However, if the preferred stock were to remain outstanding subsequent to June 15, 2012, the Company would be required to continue to pay dividends subject to the terms and conditions of the preferred stock.
837465_12_ITEM7_P90_S2	These additional dividends are not reflected in this table.
837465_12_ITEM7_P90_S3	See Note 4 Preferred Stock Offering to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
837465_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	(3) The Company leases certain warehouse, distribution and office facilities, vehicles and office equipment under operating leases.
837465_12_ITEM7_P91_S1	The amounts presented in this line item represent commitments for minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases.
837465_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	(4) Amount represents total uncertain income tax positions pursuant to the adoption of ASC Topic 740-25-6.
837465_12_ITEM7_P92_S1	For further discussion see Note 16 Income Taxes to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. During its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions.
837465_12_ITEM7_P92_S2	These include (i) intellectual property indemnities to the Company s customers and licensees in connection with the use, sale and/or license of Company products or trademarks, (ii) indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facilities or leases, (iii) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to the goods or services provided to the Company or based on the negligence or willful misconduct of the Company and (iv) indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts.
837465_12_ITEM7_P92_S3	In addition, the Company has made contractual commitments to each of its officers and certain other employees providing for severance payments upon the termination of employment.
837465_12_ITEM7_P92_S4	The Company also has consulting agreements that provide for payment of nominal fees upon the issuance of patents and/or the commercialization of research results.
837465_12_ITEM7_P92_S5	The Company has also issued guarantees in the form of a standby letter of credit as security for contingent liabilities under certain workers compensation insurance policies.
837465_12_ITEM7_P92_S6	The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases may be indefinite.
837465_12_ITEM7_P92_S7	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be obligated to make.
837465_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	Historically, costs incurred to settle claims related to indemnities have not been material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_12_ITEM7_P93_S1	In addition, the Company believes the likelihood is remote that payments under the commitments and guarantees described above will have a material effect on the Company s financial condition.
837465_12_ITEM7_P93_S2	The fair value of indemnities, commitments and guarantees that the Company issued during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 was not material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_12_ITEM7_P93_S3	In addition to the contractual obligations listed above, the Company s liquidity could also be adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome with respect to claims and litigation that the Company is subject to from time to time.
837465_12_ITEM7_P93_S4	See Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Sufficiency of Liquidity Based upon its current operating plan, analysis of its consolidated financial position and projected future results of operations, the Company believes that its operating cash flows, together with its current or future credit facilities, will be sufficient to finance current operating requirements, planned capital expenditures, contractual obligations and commercial commitments, for at least the next 12 months.
837465_12_ITEM7_P93_S5	There can be no assurance, however, that future industry-specific or other developments (including noncompliance with the financial covenants under its ABL Facility), general economic trends, foreign currency exchange rates, or other matters will not adversely affect the Company s operations or its ability to meet its future cash requirements (see above, Sources of Liquidity and Certain Factors Affecting Callaway Golf Company contained in Item 1A).
837465_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	As of December 31, 2011, a significant portion of the Company s total cash and short-term investments is held outside of the U.S. Outside of settling intercompany balances during the normal course of operations, the Company may repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries.
837465_12_ITEM7_P94_S1	The Company has not, nor does it anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with its domestic debt service requirements.
837465_12_ITEM7_P94_S2	As such, the Company considers the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon.
837465_12_ITEM7_P94_S3	If in the future the Company decides to repatriate such foreign earnings, it would need to accrue and pay incremental U.S. federal and state income tax, reduced by the current amount of available U.S. federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
837465_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	Capital Resources The Company does not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures.
837465_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	The Company expects to have capital expenditures of approximately $25.0 million to $30.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2012.
837465_12_ITEM7_P95_S2	At December 31, 2011, the Company had total outstanding commitments on non-cancelable operating leases of approximately $33.1 million related to certain warehouse, distribution and office facilities, vehicles as well as office equipment.
837465_12_ITEM7_P95_S3	Lease terms range from 1 to 7 years expiring at various dates through February 2018, with options to renew at varying terms.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes to limit its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Transactions involving these financial instruments are with creditworthy banks, including the bank that is party to the Company s ABL Facility (see Note 10 Financing Arrangements to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The use of these instruments exposes the Company to market and credit risk which may at times be concentrated with certain counterparties, although counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk from its ABL Facility.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P0_S4	In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions of its international subsidiaries, including certain balance sheet exposures (payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies) (see Note 11 Derivatives and Hedging to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_12_ITEM7A_P0_S5	In addition, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from the translation of the operating results of the Company s international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	As part of its strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts and put and call option contracts ( foreign currency exchange contracts ) to hedge transactions that are denominated primarily in British Pounds, Euros, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Korean Won.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	For most currencies, the Company is a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefits from a weaker U.S. dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which the Company transacts significant amounts of business.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Foreign currency exchange contracts are used only to meet the Company s objectives of offsetting gains and losses from foreign currency exchange exposures with gains and losses from the contracts used to hedge them in order to reduce volatility of earnings.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	of changes in foreign currency exchange rates varies based upon many factors, including the amount of transactions being hedged.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Foreign currency rates for financial reporting purposes had a significant positive impact upon the Company s consolidated reported financial results in 2011 compared to 2010 (see above, Certain Risk Factors Affecting Callaway Golf Company contained in Item 1A and Results of Operations contained in Item 7).
837465_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The Company does not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for speculative purposes.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Foreign currency exchange contracts generally mature within twelve months from their inception.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P2_S4	The Company does not designate foreign currency exchange contracts as derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P2_S5	As such, changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized in earnings in the period of change.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the notional amounts of the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts used to hedge the exposures discussed above were approximately $165.5 million, $314.2 million and $101.7 million, respectively.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no outstanding foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for anticipated sales denominated in foreign currencies.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	As part of the Company s risk management procedure, a sensitivity analysis model is used to measure the potential loss in future earnings of market-sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates or foreign currency values.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The sensitivity analysis model quantifies the estimated potential effect of unfavorable movements of 10% in foreign currencies to which the Company was exposed at December 31, 2011 through its foreign currency exchange contracts.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The estimated maximum one-day loss from the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts, calculated using the sensitivity analysis model described above, is $18.1 million at December 31, 2011.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P4_S3	The Company believes that such a hypothetical loss from its foreign currency exchange contracts would be partially offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The sensitivity analysis model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in earnings that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P5_S1	It also does not represent the maximum possible loss that may occur.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The Company is exposed to interest rate risk from its ABL Facility (see Note 10 Financing Arrangements to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_12_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The interest rate applicable to outstanding loans under the ABL Facility fluctuates depending on the Company s trailing-twelve month EBITDA (as defined by the ABL Facility) combined with the Company s availability ratio (as defined below).
837465_12_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The interest rate applicable to outstanding loans under the U.S. facility is based on a calculation of either the U.S. Prime Rate or the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate as published by Reuters ( LIBOR ) plus an applicable margin of 1.25% to 2.75%.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The interest rate applicable to outstanding loans under the Canadian facility is based on a calculation of either the Base Rate publicly announced by Bank of America Canada or Canada s Prime Rate plus a margin of 1.25% to 2.75%.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P6_S4	The interest rate applicable to outstanding loans under the U.K. facility is based on a calculation of the U.S. Prime Rate plus an applicable margin of 2.25% and 2.75%.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P7_S0	As part of the Company s risk management procedures, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of unfavorable changes in interest rates on the Company s cash flows.
837465_12_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The sensitivity analysis quantified that the incremental expense incurred by an increase of 10% in interest rates would be nominal over a twelve month period.
837465_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	independent registered public accounting firm, are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K on pages F-1 through F-35.
837465_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness, as of December 31, 2011, of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act).
837465_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2011.
837465_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
837465_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act).
837465_12_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.
837465_12_ITEM9A_P1_S3	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in its report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework.
837465_12_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Based on that assessment, management concluded that as of December 31, 2011, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the COSO criteria.
837465_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting .
837465_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2011, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
837465_12_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
837465_12_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
837465_12_ITEM9A_P2_S4	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.
837465_12_ITEM9B_P0_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Callaway Golf Company Carlsbad, California We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Callaway Golf Company and its subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
837465_12_ITEM9B_P0_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
837465_12_ITEM9B_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
837465_12_ITEM9B_P0_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
837465_12_ITEM9B_P0_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
837465_12_ITEM9B_P0_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
837465_12_ITEM9B_P0_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
837465_12_ITEM9B_P1_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
837465_12_ITEM9B_P1_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
837465_12_ITEM9B_P1_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
837465_12_ITEM9B_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

837465_12_ITEM15_P20_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
837465_12_ITEM15_P20_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
837465_12_ITEM15_P20_S3	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Callaway Golf Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

837465_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
837465_12_ITEM15_P27_S1	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
837465_12_ITEM15_P27_S2	Examples of such estimates include provisions for warranty, uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence, sales returns, tax contingencies, estimates on the valuation of share-based awards and recoverability of long-lived assets and investments.

837465_12_ITEM15_P27_S4	On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its estimates to ensure that these estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business or as new information becomes available.
837465_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.
837465_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	This ASU requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.
837465_12_ITEM15_P28_S2	ASU No. 2011-11 will be applied retrospectively and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013.
837465_12_ITEM15_P28_S3	The adoption of this amendment will not have a material impact on the Company s disclosures to the consolidated financial statements.
837465_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment.
837465_12_ITEM15_P29_S1	This ASU is intended to simplify how entities, both public and nonpublic, test goodwill for impairment.
837465_12_ITEM15_P29_S2	ASU 2011-08 permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.
837465_12_ITEM15_P29_S3	The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50%.
837465_12_ITEM15_P30_S0	Based on the Company s evaluation of this ASU, the adoption of this amendment will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
837465_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income .
837465_12_ITEM15_P31_S1	This ASU amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
837465_12_ITEM15_P31_S2	ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity.
837465_12_ITEM15_P31_S3	The amendments to the Codification in the ASU do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.
837465_12_ITEM15_P31_S4	In addition, in December 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to ASU No. 2011-05 that defers the requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement.
837465_12_ITEM15_P31_S5	ASU 2011-05 will be applied retrospectively, and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2011.
837465_12_ITEM15_P31_S6	Based on the Company s evaluation of this ASU, the adoption of this amendment will only impact the presentation of comprehensive income (loss) on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
837465_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements.
837465_12_ITEM15_P32_S1	This ASU represents the converged guidance of the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (the Boards) on fair value measurement.
837465_12_ITEM15_P32_S2	The collective efforts of the Boards and their staffs, reflected in ASU 2011-04, have resulted in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements, including a consistent meaning of the term fair value.
837465_12_ITEM15_P32_S3	The Boards have concluded the common requirements will result in greater comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
837465_12_ITEM15_P32_S4	ASU No. 2011-04 will be applied prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
837465_12_ITEM15_P32_S5	Based on the Company s evaluation of this ASU, the adoption of this amendment will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
837465_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, as products are shipped to customers, net of an allowance for sales returns and sales programs.

837465_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	Sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program, management s forecast of future product demand, and historical customer participation in similar programs.
837465_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	Revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed.
837465_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	In addition, the Company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws.
837465_12_ITEM15_P36_S2	The Company s gift cards have no expiration.
837465_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	To determine when redemption is remote, the Company analyzes an aging of unredeemed cards (based on the date the card was last used or the activation date if the card has never been used) and compares that information with historical redemption trends.
837465_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	The deferred revenue associated with outstanding gift cards decreased from $3,247,000 at December 31, 2010 to $1,988,000 at December 31, 2011.
837465_12_ITEM15_P38_S1	Revenues from course credits in connection with the use of uPro GPS on-course range finders are deferred when purchased and recognized when customers download the course credits for usage.

837465_12_ITEM15_P39_S2	The Company recognized royalty income under its various licensing agreements of $6,219,000, $5,831,000 and $5,634,000 during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
837465_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	Warranty Policy The Company has a stated two-year warranty policy for its golf clubs.
837465_12_ITEM15_P40_S1	The Company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded.
837465_12_ITEM15_P40_S2	In estimating its future warranty obligations, the Company considers various relevant factors, including the Company s stated warranty policies and practices, the historical frequency of claims, and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty.
837465_12_ITEM15_P40_S3	The decrease in the estimated future warranty obligation is primarily due to a decline in sales and in warranty return rates primarily due to improved durability of newer products combined with an increase in customer paid repairs.
837465_12_ITEM15_P40_S4	The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to the Company s reserve for warranty expense:

837465_12_ITEM15_P44_S1	The accounts of these foreign subsidiaries have been translated into United States dollars using the current exchange rate at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and at the average exchange rate for the period for revenues and expenses.
837465_12_ITEM15_P44_S2	Cumulative translation gains or losses are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity.
837465_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	Gains or losses resulting from transactions that are made in a currency different from the functional currency are recognized in earnings as they occur.
837465_12_ITEM15_P45_S1	The Company recorded net foreign currency transaction gains of $708,000, $6,926,000 and $7,112,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

837465_12_ITEM15_P46_S1	The derivative instruments are accounted for pursuant to ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, measure those instruments at fair value and recognize changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change unless the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge that offsets certain exposures.
837465_12_ITEM15_P46_S2	As of December 31, 2011, the Company had derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts and put and call option contracts that were not designated as hedging instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815.
837465_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less.
837465_12_ITEM15_P47_S1	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments.
837465_12_ITEM15_P47_S2	An estimate of uncollectable amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, the customer s financial condition and current economic trends, all of which are subject to change.
837465_12_ITEM15_P47_S3	Actual uncollected amounts have historically been consistent with the Company s expectations.
837465_12_ITEM15_P48_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value.
837465_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
837465_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	The inventory balance, which includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs, is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory.
837465_12_ITEM15_P50_S1	The estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon current inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience as well as management s estimates of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand, all of which are subject to change.
837465_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
837465_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows:
837465_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	Normal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
837465_12_ITEM15_P53_S1	Expenditures that materially increase values, change capacities or extend useful lives are capitalized.
837465_12_ITEM15_P53_S2	The related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income (loss).
837465_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	Construction in-process consists primarily of costs associated with building improvements, machinery and equipment that have not yet been placed into service, unfinished molds as well as in-process internally developed software.

837465_12_ITEM15_P55_S1	Costs incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed.
837465_12_ITEM15_P55_S2	All direct external costs incurred to develop internal-use software during the development stage are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful lives.
837465_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-05, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , the Company assesses potential impairments of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying value may not be recoverable.
837465_12_ITEM15_P56_S1	An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.
837465_12_ITEM15_P56_S2	The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group.
837465_12_ITEM15_P57_S0	Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets consist of goodwill, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, patents and other intangible assets acquired during the acquisition of Odyssey Sports, Inc., the Top-Flite and Ben Hogan assets, FrogTrader, Inc., the Tour Golf Group assets, the uPlay, LLC assets and certain foreign distributors.
837465_12_ITEM15_P57_S1	In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists.
837465_12_ITEM15_P57_S2	The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets over their estimated fair value.
837465_12_ITEM15_P57_S3	If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded.
837465_12_ITEM15_P57_S4	To determine fair value, the Company uses its internal discounted cash flow estimates, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals when appropriate.
837465_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-05 discussed above.
837465_12_ITEM15_P58_S1	See Note 9 for further discussion of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets.
837465_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	Investments The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of acquisition and reevaluates such classification at each balance sheet date.
837465_12_ITEM15_P59_S1	Investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are stated at cost and are reported in other assets.
837465_12_ITEM15_P59_S2	The Company monitors investments for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 325-35-2, Impairment and ASC Topic 320-35-17 through 35-35, Scope of Impairment Guidance.
837465_12_ITEM15_P59_S3	See Note 5 for further discussion of the Company s investments.
837465_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Company accounts for its share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ( ASC Topic 718 ), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values.
837465_12_ITEM15_P60_S1	ASC Topic 718 further requires a reduction in share-based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	The forfeiture rate used by the Company is based on historical forfeiture trends.
837465_12_ITEM15_P61_S1	If actual forfeiture rates are not consistent with the Company s estimates, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods.
837465_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options and stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) at the date of grant.
837465_12_ITEM15_P62_S1	The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions to calculate the value of stock options/SARs.
837465_12_ITEM15_P62_S2	The Company uses historical data among other information to estimate the expected price volatility, option/SAR life, and forfeiture rate.
837465_12_ITEM15_P62_S3	The Company uses forecasted dividends to estimate the expected dividend yield.
837465_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	calculation is more appropriate than using historical data since the amount of dividends paid have decreased beginning in 2009.
837465_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option/SAR.
837465_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for stock options.
837465_12_ITEM15_P65_S1	Compensation expense for SARs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an estimated fair value, which is remeasured each reporting period.
837465_12_ITEM15_P65_S2	Once vested, the SARs continue to be remeasured to fair value until they are exercised.
837465_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Company records compensation expense for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (collectively restricted stock ) based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
837465_12_ITEM15_P66_S1	The estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the award date multiplied by the number of shares underlying the restricted stock awarded.
837465_12_ITEM15_P66_S2	Total compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
837465_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	Phantom stock units ( PSUs ) are a form of share-based awards that are indexed to the Company s stock and are settled in cash.
837465_12_ITEM15_P67_S1	As such, these awards are classified as liabilities.
837465_12_ITEM15_P68_S0	Because PSUs are settled in cash, compensation expense recognized over the vesting period will vary based on changes in fair value.
837465_12_ITEM15_P68_S1	Fair value is remeasured at the end of each interim reporting period through the award s settlement date and is based on the closing price of the Company s stock.
837465_12_ITEM15_P69_S0	Income Taxes Current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year.
837465_12_ITEM15_P70_S0	A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to ASC Topic 740 and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
837465_12_ITEM15_P70_S1	In accordance with the applicable accounting rules, the Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it deemed it to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
837465_12_ITEM15_P70_S2	In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire.
837465_12_ITEM15_P70_S3	These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment, including estimates of future taxable income.
837465_12_ITEM15_P70_S4	These estimates are based on the Company s best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions.
837465_12_ITEM15_P70_S5	As a result of the Company s evaluation during 2011, the Company recorded a $52,455,000 increase to income tax expense in order to establish a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_12_ITEM15_P70_S6	In addition, the Company has discontinued recognizing income tax benefits related to its U.S. net operating losses until it is determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefits from its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_12_ITEM15_P70_S7	For further information, see Note 16 Income Taxes.
837465_12_ITEM15_P70_S8	Pursuant to ASC Topic 740-25-6, the Company is required to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is deemed to be more likely than not that the Company would be required to pay such additional taxes.
837465_12_ITEM15_P70_S9	The Company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions.
837465_12_ITEM15_P70_S10	The preparation of these income tax returns requires the Company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by the Company.
837465_12_ITEM15_P70_S11	The Company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability, including interest and penalties, for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return.
837465_12_ITEM15_P70_S12	The Company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available.
837465_12_ITEM15_P71_S0	Historically, additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the Company s uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the Company s expectations.
837465_12_ITEM15_P71_S1	For further information, see Note 16 Income Taxes.
837465_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net primarily includes gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts and foreign currency transactions.

837465_12_ITEM15_P72_S3	Since the Company has met the indefinite reversal criteria, it does not accrue income taxes on foreign currency translation adjustments.
837465_12_ITEM15_P72_S4	The total equity adjustment from foreign currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income was income of $14,071,000 and $13,564,000 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
837465_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	The Company s operating segments are organized on the basis of products and consist of Golf Clubs and Golf Balls.
837465_12_ITEM15_P73_S1	The Golf Clubs segment consists primarily of Callaway Golf and Top-Flite woods, hybrids, irons, wedges and putters as well as Odyssey putters, pre-owned clubs, GPS on-course range finders, other golf-related accessories and royalties from licensing of the Company s trademarks and service marks.

837465_12_ITEM15_P73_S3	The Company also discloses information about geographic areas.
837465_12_ITEM15_P73_S4	This information is presented in Note 19.
837465_12_ITEM15_P74_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk The Company s financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, trade receivables and foreign currency exchange contracts.
837465_12_ITEM15_P74_S1	The Company historically invests its excess cash in money market accounts and short-term U.S. government securities and has established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities in an effort to maintain safety and liquidity.
837465_12_ITEM15_P74_S2	These guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of trends in yields and interest rates.
837465_12_ITEM15_P75_S0	The Company operates in the golf equipment industry and primarily sells its products to golf equipment retailers (including pro shops at golf courses and off-course retailers), sporting goods retailers and mass merchants, directly and through wholly-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries, and to foreign distributors.
837465_12_ITEM15_P75_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally requires no collateral from these customers.
837465_12_ITEM15_P75_S2	The Company maintains reserves for estimated credit losses, which it considers adequate to cover any such losses.
837465_12_ITEM15_P75_S3	At December 31, 2011, no single customer in the United States represented over 10% of the Company s outstanding accounts receivable balance.
837465_12_ITEM15_P76_S0	Managing customer-related credit risk is more difficult in regions outside of the United States.
837465_12_ITEM15_P76_S1	During 2011, approximately 53% of the Company s net sales were made in regions outside of the United States, compared to 52% in 2010 and 50% in 2009.
837465_12_ITEM15_P76_S2	Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions in the United States or in the Company s international markets could significantly increase the Company s credit risk.
837465_12_ITEM15_P77_S0	From time to time, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and put or call options for the purpose of hedging foreign exchange rate exposures on existing or anticipated transactions.
837465_12_ITEM15_P77_S1	In the event of a failure to honor one of these contracts by one of the banks with which the Company has contracted, management believes any loss would be limited to the exchange rate differential from the time the contract was made until the time it was settled.
837465_12_ITEM15_P78_S0	In 2010, the Company began the implementation of its Global Operations Strategy Initiatives ( GOS Initiatives ), which targeted the restructuring and relocation of the Company s manufacturing and distribution operations.
837465_12_ITEM15_P79_S0	During the third quarter of 2010, as part of the Company s GOS Initiatives, the Company announced the restructuring of its golf club and golf ball manufacturing and distribution operations.
837465_12_ITEM15_P79_S1	This restructuring, which is designed to add speed and flexibility to customer service demands, optimize efficiencies, and facilitate long-term gross margin improvements, includes the reorganization of the Company s manufacturing and distribution centers located in Carlsbad, California, Toronto, Canada, and Chicopee, Massachusetts, the creation of third-party logistics sites in Dallas, Texas and Toronto, Canada, as well as the establishment of a new production facility in Monterrey, Mexico.
837465_12_ITEM15_P79_S2	This restructuring was completed in 2011.
837465_12_ITEM15_P79_S3	The Company intends to maintain limited manufacturing and distribution facilities in Carlsbad, California and Chicopee, Massachusetts.
837465_12_ITEM15_P79_S4	As a result of this restructuring, the Company has recognized non-cash charges for the acceleration of depreciation on certain golf club and golf ball manufacturing equipment and cash charges related to severance benefits and transition costs, which consist primarily of consulting expenses, costs associated with redundancies during the start-up and training phase of the new production facility in Monterrey, Mexico, start-up costs associated with the establishment of third-party logistics sites, travel expenses, and costs associated with the transfer of inventory and equipment.
837465_12_ITEM15_P79_S5	For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $24,680,000 and $14,816,000, respectively, in connection with this restructuring.

837465_12_ITEM15_P80_S1	The Company s restructuring plan is expected to result in annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $50,000,000 with up to half of this savings to be reinvested into the Callaway brand and more effective demand creation initiatives.
837465_12_ITEM15_P80_S2	The majority of these savings and reinvestments are expected to be realized in 2012.
837465_12_ITEM15_P81_S0	$16,329,000 of charges related to these initiatives, of which $1,251,000 and $15,078,000 were recognized in cost of goods sold and operating expenses, respectively.

837465_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	The terms of the preferred stock provide for a liquidation preference of $100 per share and cumulative dividends from the date of original issue at a rate of 7.50% per annum (equal to an annual rate of $7.50 per share), subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
837465_12_ITEM15_P83_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the liquidation preference would have been $140,438,000.
837465_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	Dividends on the preferred stock are payable quarterly in arrears subject to declaration by the Board of Directors and compliance with the Company s line of credit and applicable law.

837465_12_ITEM15_P92_S1	The following sets forth the intangible assets by major asset class:
837465_12_ITEM15_P92_S2	Aggregate amortization expense on intangible assets was approximately $3,979,000, $4,181,000 and $4,261,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
837465_12_ITEM15_P92_S3	Amortization expense related to intangible assets at December 31, 2011 in each of the next five fiscal years and beyond is expected to be incurred as follows (in thousands): Goodwill at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 was $29,203,000 and $30,630,000.
837465_12_ITEM15_P92_S4	This decrease was due to the write-off of $1,120,000 of goodwill related to the Company s reporting unit in Australia as a result of an impairment (see below), as well as $307,000 due to foreign currency fluctuations.
837465_12_ITEM15_P92_S5	Gross goodwill before impairments at December 31, 2011 and 2011 was $30,323,000 and $30,630,000, respectively.
837465_12_ITEM15_P93_S0	During the second quarter of 2011, the Company conducted an impairment test on its goodwill and intangible assets, including the trade names, trademarks and other intangible assets the Company acquired in 2003 as part of the Top-Flite acquisition.
837465_12_ITEM15_P93_S1	The fair value of the Company s intangible assets was calculated by taking the expected future cash flows of those assets over their estimated useful lives and discounting the cash flows based upon an appropriate discount rate.
837465_12_ITEM15_P93_S2	The discounted cash flow analysis was based upon management s best estimates relating to the Company s intangible assets such as (i) forecasted sales, (ii) estimated royalty rates, (iii) estimated long-term growth rates, and (iv) the discount rate.
837465_12_ITEM15_P93_S3	In calculating the expected future cash flows from the trade names and trademarks acquired as part of the Top-Flite acquisition, the Company considered the continued negative impact of a trend in the golf industry where premium branded competitor golf balls are being sold through the mass market channel as well as a recent increase of in-house brands being sold in the sporting goods and mass market channels.
837465_12_ITEM15_P93_S4	This increase in premium branded and in-house balls in these retail channels over the past two years as well as the fact that the Company s business in the United States has not recovered and returned to profitability as management had previously projected has negatively impacted sales of Top-Flite branded golf balls more than previously estimated.
837465_12_ITEM15_P94_S0	these retail channels would abate over time as the economy began to improve, the Company has concluded that this practice appears more permanent in nature, and accordingly has reduced its estimates of the amount of future cash flows that will be generated from these intangible assets.
837465_12_ITEM15_P94_S1	In completing the impairment analysis, the Company determined that the discounted expected cash flows from the trade names and trademarks associated with the Top-Flite acquisition was $5,413,000 less than the carrying value of those assets.
837465_12_ITEM15_P94_S2	As a result, during the second quarter of 2011, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $5,413,000 in order to write-down these assets to fair value.
837465_12_ITEM15_P94_S3	During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company also recorded an impairment charge of $7,547,000 related to the trade names and trademarks of the Top-Flite acquisition.

837465_12_ITEM15_P94_S5	In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company conducted an impairment test on goodwill related to its reporting unit in Australia.
837465_12_ITEM15_P94_S6	Due to the negative impact of significant flooding and inclimate weather as well as a decline in economic conditions in that region during 2011, the Company determined that the estimated fair value for this unit was $1,120,000 less than the unit s net book value including goodwill.
837465_12_ITEM15_P94_S7	As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1,120,000 to write-off the goodwill balance related to this reporting unit.

837465_12_ITEM15_P118_S4	The model uses various assumptions, including a risk-free interest rate, the expected term of the options, the expected stock price volatility, and the expected dividend yield.
837465_12_ITEM15_P119_S0	Compensation expense for employee stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term and is reduced by an estimate for forfeitures, which is based on the Company s historical forfeitures of unvested options and awards.
837465_12_ITEM15_P119_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the weighted average estimated forfeiture rate used was 4.5%, 3.5% and 4.4%, respectively.
837465_12_ITEM15_P120_S0	The table below summarizes the average fair value assumptions used in the valuation of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
837465_12_ITEM15_P121_S0	The Company uses forecasted dividends to estimate the expected dividend yield as dividends paid have decreased beginning in 2009.
837465_12_ITEM15_P121_S1	The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility, among other factors, of the Company s stock.
837465_12_ITEM15_P121_S2	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected term of the options at the date of the grant.
837465_12_ITEM15_P121_S3	The expected life of the Company s options is based on evaluations of historical employee exercise behavior, forfeitures, cancellations and other factors.
837465_12_ITEM15_P121_S4	The valuation model applied in this calculation utilizes highly subjective assumptions that could potentially change over time.
837465_12_ITEM15_P121_S5	Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option.
837465_12_ITEM15_P121_S6	Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by the employee holding the option.
837465_12_ITEM15_P122_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s stock option activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 (in thousands, except price per share and contractual term): The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $2.94, $2.37 and $3.95 per share, respectively.

837465_12_ITEM15_P122_S4	That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.3 years.
837465_12_ITEM15_P123_S0	The amount of unrecognized compensation expense noted above does not necessarily represent the amount that will ultimately be realized by the Company in its consolidated statement of operations.
837465_12_ITEM15_P124_S0	Cash received from the exercise of stock options for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $564,000.

837465_12_ITEM15_P127_S0	The amount of unrecognized compensation expense noted above does not necessarily represent the amount that will ultimately be realized by the Company in its consolidated statement of operations.
837465_12_ITEM15_P128_S0	Phantom Stock Units Phantom stock units ( PSUs ) awarded under the 2004 Plan are a form of share-based award that is indexed to the Company s stock and is settled in cash.
837465_12_ITEM15_P128_S1	As such, these awards are classified as liabilities.
837465_12_ITEM15_P129_S0	Because PSUs are settled in cash, compensation expense recognized over the vesting period will vary based on changes in fair value.
837465_12_ITEM15_P129_S1	Fair value is remeasured at the end of each interim reporting period and is based on the closing price of the Company s stock.
837465_12_ITEM15_P129_S2	PSUs generally vest over two and three year periods.
837465_12_ITEM15_P129_S3	The table below summarizes the total number of PSUs granted to employees during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands).

837465_12_ITEM15_P130_S0	In 2011, the Company granted 500,000 units of cash settled stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) that vest over one year.
837465_12_ITEM15_P130_S1	The Company records compensation expense for SARs based on the estimated fair value on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model.
837465_12_ITEM15_P130_S2	SARs are subsequently remeasured at each interim reporting period based on a revised Black Scholes value until they are exercised.

837465_12_ITEM15_P132_S0	In connection with an employment agreement with a former executive officer of the Company, the Company was contractually obligated to grant $11,730,000 in the form of various share-based awards over the service period stipulated in the agreement.
837465_12_ITEM15_P132_S1	As a result, the total contractual obligation related to these equity awards was recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term, which resulted in the recognition of compensation expense of $1,415,000, $2,401,000 and $1,800,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
837465_12_ITEM15_P132_S2	In 2011, as a result of the resignation of the executive officer, the Company accelerated the vesting period of all outstanding equity awards granted under the employment agreement, which resulted in the recognition of additional compensation expense of $2,136,000.
837465_12_ITEM15_P132_S3	In total, in connection with the Reorganization and Reinvestment Initiatives announced in June 2011 (see Note 3), the Company recognized $3,539,000 during the year ended December 31, 2011 in stock compensation expense as a result of the contractual acceleration of the vesting of certain stock options, restricted stock units and phantom stock units.
837465_12_ITEM15_P132_S4	There were no material award accelerations during 2010 and 2009.
837465_12_ITEM15_P133_S0	Employee Benefit Plans The Company has a voluntary deferred compensation plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the 401(k) Plan ) for all employees who satisfy the age and service requirements under the 401(k) Plan.
837465_12_ITEM15_P133_S1	Each participant may elect to contribute up to 25% of annual compensation, up to the maximum permitted under federal law.
837465_12_ITEM15_P133_S2	In 2011 and 2010, the Company matched an amount equal to 100% of the participant s contributions up to 6% of their eligible annual compensation.
837465_12_ITEM15_P133_S3	In 2009, the Company match was temporarily suspended in light of the unfavorable economic conditions and the Company s efforts to reduce costs during that year.
837465_12_ITEM15_P134_S0	The portion of the participant s account attributable to elective deferral contributions and rollover contributions are 100% vested and nonforfeitable.
837465_12_ITEM15_P134_S1	Participants vest in employer matching and profit sharing contributions at a rate of 25% per year, becoming fully vested after the completion of four years of service.
837465_12_ITEM15_P134_S2	In accordance with the provisions of the 401(k) Plan, the Company matched employee contributions in the amount of $5,061,000, $5,431,000 and $1,380,000 during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

837465_12_ITEM15_P135_S0	During 2011, 2010 and 2009, tax benefits related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards were $0, $492,000 and $1,028,000, respectively.
837465_12_ITEM15_P135_S1	Such benefits were recorded as a reduction of income taxes payable with a corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital or a decrease to deferred tax assets in connection with compensation cost previously recognized in income.
837465_12_ITEM15_P136_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent according to the classification of the related asset or liability.
837465_12_ITEM15_P136_S1	Significant components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows (in thousands):
837465_12_ITEM15_P137_S0	The current year change in net deferred taxes of $56,019,000 is comprised of a net deferred expense of $57,291,000 recorded through current income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, offset by $88,000 of foreign currency translation adjustments and a net deferred benefit of $1,184,000 related to reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC Topic 740-25-6.
837465_12_ITEM15_P138_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are anticipated to be in effect at the time the differences are expected to reverse.
837465_12_ITEM15_P138_S1	The realization of the deferred tax assets, including the loss and credit carry forwards listed above, is subject to the Company generating sufficient taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become realizable.
837465_12_ITEM15_P139_S0	In accordance with the applicable accounting rules, the Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it deemed it to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
837465_12_ITEM15_P140_S0	income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire.
837465_12_ITEM15_P140_S1	These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment, including estimates of future taxable income.
837465_12_ITEM15_P140_S2	These estimates are based on the Company s best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions.
837465_12_ITEM15_P140_S3	At December 31, 2011, the Company had deferred tax assets of $119,197,000.
837465_12_ITEM15_P140_S4	Approximately $115,296,000 of the deferred tax assets pertain to the Company s U.S. business and $3,901,000 pertain to foreign jurisdictions.
837465_12_ITEM15_P140_S5	In evaluating the likelihood that these deferred tax assets will be realized, the Company considered the Company s taxable loss in the United States in each of the past three years, the reasons for such loss, the Company s projected financial forecast for the U.S business, and the dates on which the deferred tax assets are expected to expire.
837465_12_ITEM15_P140_S6	When evaluated in light of the applicable standards, this evidence suggests that the Company should establish a valuation allowance.
837465_12_ITEM15_P140_S7	As a result, in 2011, the Company recorded a $52,455,000 increase to income tax expense in order to establish a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets and discontinued recognizing income tax benefits related to its U.S. net operating losses.
837465_12_ITEM15_P140_S8	If sufficient positive evidence arises in the future, such as a sustained return to profitability, any existing valuation allowance could be reversed as appropriate, decreasing income tax expense in the period that such conclusion is reached.
837465_12_ITEM15_P140_S9	The Company has concluded that with respect to non-U.S. entities, there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that realization of its deferred tax assets is deemed to be more likely than not under applicable accounting rules, and no allowances have been established.
837465_12_ITEM15_P140_S10	The non-cash charge to establish a valuation allowance does not have any impact on the Company s consolidated cash flows, nor does such an allowance preclude the Company from using loss carry forwards or other deferred tax assets in the future, except as described below.
837465_12_ITEM15_P140_S11	Until the Company re-establishes a pattern of continuing profitability, in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, U.S. income tax expense or benefit related to the recognition of deferred tax assets in the consolidated statement of operations for future periods will be offset by decreases or increases in the valuation allowance with no net effect on the consolidated statement of operations.
837465_12_ITEM15_P140_S12	As a result of the establishment of the valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets, the Company does not recognize a tax benefit on taxable losses generated in the U.S.
837465_12_ITEM15_P140_S13	Furthermore, income taxes related to intercompany profits generated from sales in the U.S. to the Company s foreign subsidiaries that would typically impact the statement of operations in periods with no valuation allowance are no longer deferred and amounts previously accumulated as prepaid tax expense are charged to the provision for income taxes in the statement of operations.
837465_12_ITEM15_P140_S14	The reversal of the prepaid tax asset is included in the determination of the annual estimated effective tax rate resulting in $21,634,000 of tax expense for the year ended 2011.
837465_12_ITEM15_P140_S15	The Company has federal and state income tax credit carryforwards of $5,166,000 and $6,363,000 respectively, which will expire at various dates beginning in 2020.
837465_12_ITEM15_P140_S16	Such credit carryforward expire as follows:
837465_12_ITEM15_P141_S0	The Company has recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the benefit of operating loss carryforwards.
837465_12_ITEM15_P141_S1	The net operating losses expire as follows:
837465_12_ITEM15_P142_S0	Although the Company has set up a valuation allowance against the majority of its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carry forwards ( NOLs ) and other losses, such allowance does not preclude the Company from using the deferred tax assets in the future.
837465_12_ITEM15_P142_S1	However, the Company s ability to utilize the losses to offset future taxable income may be deferred or limited significantly if the Company were to experience an ownership change as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
837465_12_ITEM15_P143_S0	In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in ownership of the Company s stock by 5-percent shareholders (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
837465_12_ITEM15_P143_S1	The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred for purposes of Section 382 is complex and requires significant judgment.
837465_12_ITEM15_P143_S2	The extent to which the Company s ability to utilize the losses is limited as a result of such an ownership change depends on many variables, including the value of the Company s stock at the time of the ownership change.
837465_12_ITEM15_P143_S3	Although the Company s ownership has changed significantly during the three-year period ended December 31, 2011 (due in significant part to the Company s June 2009 preferred stock offering), the Company does not believe there has been a cumulative increase in ownership in excess of 50 percentage points during that period.
837465_12_ITEM15_P143_S4	The Company continues to monitor changes in ownership.
837465_12_ITEM15_P143_S5	If such a cumulative increase did occur in any three year period and the Company was limited in the amount of losses it could use to offset taxable income, the Company s results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted.
837465_12_ITEM15_P144_S0	A reconciliation of the effective tax rate on income or loss and the statutory tax rate is as follows: In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the tax rate benefited from net favorable adjustments to previously estimated tax liabilities in the amount of $2,000, $515,000 and $457,000, respectively.
837465_12_ITEM15_P144_S1	The most significant favorable adjustments in each year related to adjustments resulting from the finalization of the Company s prior year U.S. and state income tax returns as well as agreements reached with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and other major jurisdictions on certain issues necessitating a reassessment of the Company s tax exposures for all open tax years, with no individual year being significantly affected.
837465_12_ITEM15_P145_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):
837465_12_ITEM15_P146_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax benefits was $9,875,000 and can be reduced by $4,310,000 of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments which was recorded as a long-term income tax receivable, as well as $1,089,000 of tax benefits associated with state income taxes and other timing adjustments which are recorded as deferred income taxes pursuant to ASC Topic 740-25-6.
837465_12_ITEM15_P146_S1	The net amount of $4,476,000, if recognized, would affect the Company s financial statements and favorably affect the Company s effective income tax rate.
837465_12_ITEM15_P146_S2	The Company does expect changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months; however, the Company does not expect the changes to have a material impact on its results of operations or its financial position.
837465_12_ITEM15_P147_S0	The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
837465_12_ITEM15_P147_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized tax expense of approximately $242,000, and a net benefit of approximately $490,000 and $190,000, respectively, related to interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes.
837465_12_ITEM15_P147_S2	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had accrued $890,000 and $648,000, respectively, (before income tax benefit) in long-term liabilities for the payment of interest and penalties.
837465_12_ITEM15_P148_S0	The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and foreign jurisdictions.
837465_12_ITEM15_P148_S1	The Company is generally no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities in its major jurisdictions as follows: As of December 31, 2011, the Company did not provide for United States income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on a cumulative total of $97,551,000 of undistributed earnings from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that will be permanently reinvested outside the United States.
837465_12_ITEM15_P148_S2	Upon remittance, certain foreign countries impose withholding taxes that are then available, subject to certain limitations, for use as credits against the Company s U.S. tax liability, if any.
837465_12_ITEM15_P148_S3	It is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability on such unremitted earnings.
837465_12_ITEM15_P148_S4	Should the Company repatriate foreign earnings, the Company would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period management determined that the Company would repatriate earnings.

837465_12_ITEM15_P149_S2	Accordingly, the Company recorded a prior period adjustment as of December 31, 2008, which resulted in a decrease to retained earnings of $9,428,000 and an increase to additional paid-in capital of $461,000, with corresponding decreases of $879,000 and $8,088,000 to short-term and long-term deferred tax assets.

837465_12_ITEM15_P149_S4	The Company does not believe the foregoing corrections are material to such financial statements.
837465_12_ITEM15_P149_S5	The effects of these corrections on the Company s December 31, 2010 consolidated financial statements are summarized as follows (in thousands):

837465_12_ITEM15_P150_S1	The Company also receives from time to time information claiming that products sold by the Company infringe or may infringe patent, trademark, or other intellectual property rights of third parties.
837465_12_ITEM15_P150_S2	One or more such claims of potential infringement could lead to litigation, the need to obtain licenses, the need to alter a product to avoid infringement, a settlement or judgment, or some other action or material loss by the Company, which also could adversely affect the Company s overall ability to protect its product designs and ultimately limit its future success in the marketplace.
837465_12_ITEM15_P150_S3	In addition, the Company is occasionally subject to non-routine claims, proceedings, or investigations.
837465_12_ITEM15_P150_S4	The Company regularly assesses such matters to determine the degree of probability that the Company will incur a loss as a result of such matters as well as the range of possible loss.
837465_12_ITEM15_P151_S0	An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the Company s financial statements if it is probable the Company will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
837465_12_ITEM15_P152_S0	The Company reviews all claims, proceedings, and investigations at least quarterly and establishes or adjusts any accruals for such matters to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.
837465_12_ITEM15_P152_S1	All legal costs associated with such matters are expensed as incurred.
837465_12_ITEM15_P153_S0	Historically, the claims, proceedings and investigations brought against the Company, individually, and in the aggregate, have not had a material adverse effect upon the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial position of the Company.
837465_12_ITEM15_P153_S1	The Company believes that it has valid legal defenses to the matters currently pending against the Company.
837465_12_ITEM15_P153_S2	These matters, including the matters specifically described below, are inherently unpredictable and the resolutions of those matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcomes are not predictable with assurance.
837465_12_ITEM15_P153_S3	Consequently, management is unable to estimate the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary loss, amounts covered by insurance, or the financial impact that will result from such matters.
837465_12_ITEM15_P153_S4	Management believes that the final resolution of the current matters pending against the Company, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company s consolidated financial position.
837465_12_ITEM15_P153_S5	It is possible, however, that the Company s results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these contingencies.
837465_12_ITEM15_P154_S0	Set forth below is a description of certain litigation to which the Company is a party.
837465_12_ITEM15_P155_S0	The 2006 Pro V1 Golf Ball Patent Infringement Litigation On February 9, 2006, the Company filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Delaware (Case No. C.A. 06-91) asserting patent infringement claims against the Acushnet Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fortune Brands, alleging that Acushnet s Titleist Pro V1 family of golf balls infringed nine claims contained in four golf ball patents owned by the Company.
837465_12_ITEM15_P155_S1	The Company prevailed in a December 2007 jury trial on 8 of the 9 patent claims asserted against Acushnet.
837465_12_ITEM15_P155_S2	In November 2008, the Delaware District Court entered a permanent injunction prohibiting continued sales of the infringing Pro V1 golf balls by Acushnet.
837465_12_ITEM15_P155_S3	In August 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed and remanded the case for a new trial.
837465_12_ITEM15_P155_S4	The case was retried and on March 29, 2010, a jury found that the claims in the patents asserted by the Company against Acushnet were invalid.
837465_12_ITEM15_P155_S5	On April 21, 2011, the District Court in Delaware denied, in part, the Company s motion for judgment as a matter of law and denied the Company s motion for a new trial.
837465_12_ITEM15_P155_S6	The Company has appealed the District Court s rulings to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Appeal No. 2011-1407.
837465_12_ITEM15_P156_S0	In 2006 Acushnet filed requests for reexamination of the patents asserted by the Company in the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ).
837465_12_ITEM15_P156_S1	On March 9, 2011, the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences ( BPAI ) affirmed an examiner s rejection of the patents, relying on evidence submitted by Acushnet in its requests for reexamination.
837465_12_ITEM15_P156_S2	On April 11, 2011, the Company asked the BPAI to reconsider its decision.
837465_12_ITEM15_P156_S3	On September 24, 2011, the BPAI denied the Company s request for reconsideration.
837465_12_ITEM15_P156_S4	The Company has appealed the BPAI s decision to the Federal Circuit, Appeal Nos. 2011-1622, 2011-1623, 2011-1624, and 2011-1625.
837465_12_ITEM15_P157_S0	The Company has asserted in the 2006 Pro V1 Golf Ball Patent Litigation described above that Acushnet breached a 1996 settlement agreement by filing the requests for reexamination of the asserted patents in the PTO.
837465_12_ITEM15_P157_S1	On January 13, 2011, the District Court in Delaware entered an order finding Acushnet breached the 1996 settlement agreement by filing the reexamination requests in the PTO.
837465_12_ITEM15_P157_S2	Damages for Acushnet s breach of the 1996 settlement agreement have not yet been determined by the Court or by a jury.
837465_12_ITEM15_P158_S0	On March 15, 2011, the Company filed suit against the Director of the PTO in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Case No. 1:11 cv 266, seeking a court order vacating, holding unlawful, and setting aside the PTO s orders in the reexamination proceedings initiated by Acushnet.
837465_12_ITEM15_P158_S1	Among other things, the Company has alleged that the PTO s refusal to vacate or stay the reexamination proceedings in the face of the Delaware court s order determining that the PTO proceedings were initiated in breach of the 1996 settlement agreement exceeded the PTO s jurisdiction and authority and was arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise contrary to law.
837465_12_ITEM15_P158_S2	On July 27, 2011, the Court granted the PTO s motion for summary judgment, holding that the PTO s actions were not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to the law.
837465_12_ITEM15_P158_S3	The Company has appealed the Court s decision to the Federal Circuit, Appeal No. 2011-1551.
837465_12_ITEM15_P159_S0	The 2009 Pro V1 Golf Ball Patent Litigation After the District Court in Delaware issued a permanent injunction barring further sales of the infringing Pro V1 golf balls in November 2008, Acushnet introduced a new version of those golf balls.
837465_12_ITEM15_P160_S0	On March 3, 2009, the Company filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Case No.
837465_12_ITEM15_P160_S1	C.A. 09131, asserting claims against Acushnet for patent infringement with regard to the new balls.
837465_12_ITEM15_P160_S2	Specifically, the complaint asserts that two golf ball patents owned by the Company and acquired from Top-Flite are infringed by the new versions of the Pro V1 golf balls introduced in 2009.
837465_12_ITEM15_P160_S3	Acushnet has filed requests for reexamination with the PTO challenging the validity of the two patents asserted by the Company in the 2009 litigation.
837465_12_ITEM15_P160_S4	The PTO has issued final office actions rejecting the claims of the two patents and the Company has appealed those rejections to the BPAI.
837465_12_ITEM15_P161_S0	On March 3, 2009, Acushnet filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Case No.
837465_12_ITEM15_P161_S1	C.A. 09-130, asserting claims against the Company for patent infringement.
837465_12_ITEM15_P162_S0	Acushnet then dropped one of the patents, but expanded its infringement contentions to allege that seven other models of the Company s golf balls, using the Company s patented HX surface geometry, infringe five of the Acushnet patents asserted in its suit.
837465_12_ITEM15_P162_S1	Acushnet is seeking damages and an injunction to prevent alleged infringement by the Company.
837465_12_ITEM15_P162_S2	The case was consolidated for discovery and pretrial with the Company s March 3, 2009 case against Acushnet, described above.
837465_12_ITEM15_P162_S3	On February 25, 2011, the District Court in Delaware entered an order temporarily staying the 2009 cases pursuant to the stipulation of the parties.
837465_12_ITEM15_P162_S4	On May 6, 2011, the parties requested, and the District Court agreed, to temporarily continue the stay of the 2009 cases.
837465_12_ITEM15_P162_S5	Pursuant to an agreement between the parties, the stay remains in place.
837465_12_ITEM15_P163_S0	Corporate Trade Inc. Litigation On January 19, 2009, the Company filed suit in the Superior Court for the County of San Diego, Case No. 37-2009-00050363-CU-BC-NC, against Corporate Trade Inc. ( CTI ) seeking damages for breach of contract and for declaratory relief based on the asserted use and transfer of corporate trade credits to the Company in connection with the purchase of assets from Top-Flite in 2003.
837465_12_ITEM15_P163_S1	On January 26, 2009, CTI filed its own suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Case No. 09CV0698, asserting claims for breach of contract, account stated and unjust enrichment, and seeking damages of approximately $8,900,000.
837465_12_ITEM15_P163_S2	On February 26, 2009, CTI removed the Company s San Diego case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.
837465_12_ITEM15_P163_S3	On March 1, 2010, the San Diego case was transferred to the Southern District of New York where it was consolidated with the New York case.
837465_12_ITEM15_P163_S4	On January 17, 2012, the parties entered into a settlement agreement resolving all disputes; the case was dismissed on January 25, 2012.
837465_12_ITEM15_P164_S0	Lease Commitments The Company leases certain warehouse, distribution and office facilities, vehicles as well as office equipment under operating leases.
837465_12_ITEM15_P164_S1	Lease terms range from 1 to 7 years expiring at various dates through February 2018, with options to renew at varying terms.
837465_12_ITEM15_P164_S2	Commitments for minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2011 are as follows (in thousands):
837465_12_ITEM15_P164_S3	Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $22,318,000, $13,967,000 and $13,567,000, respectively.
837465_12_ITEM15_P165_S0	During the normal course of its business, the Company enters into agreements to purchase goods and services, including purchase commitments for production materials, endorsement agreements with professional golfers and other endorsers, employment and consulting agreements, and intellectual property licensing agreements pursuant to which the Company is required to pay royalty fees.
837465_12_ITEM15_P165_S1	It is not possible to determine the amounts the Company will ultimately be required to pay under these agreements as they are subject to many variables including performance-based bonuses, reductions in payment obligations if designated minimum performance criteria are not achieved, and severance arrangements.
837465_12_ITEM15_P166_S0	entered into many of these contractual agreements with terms ranging from one to six years.
837465_12_ITEM15_P166_S1	The minimum obligation that the Company is required to pay under these agreements is $79,049,000 over the next six years.
837465_12_ITEM15_P166_S2	In addition, the Company also enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders or other documentation or that are undocumented except for an invoice.
837465_12_ITEM15_P166_S3	Such unconditional purchase obligations are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected in this total.
837465_12_ITEM15_P167_S0	During its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions.
837465_12_ITEM15_P167_S1	These include (i) intellectual property indemnities to the Company s customers and licensees in connection with the use, sale and/or license of Company products, (ii) indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facilities or leases, (iii) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to the goods and services provided to the Company or based on the negligence or willful misconduct of the Company and (iv) indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts.
837465_12_ITEM15_P167_S2	In addition, the Company has consulting agreements that provide for payment of nominal fees upon the issuance of patents and/or the commercialization of research results.
837465_12_ITEM15_P167_S3	The Company has also issued guarantees in the form of a standby letter of credit as security for contingent liabilities under certain workers compensation insurance policies.
837465_12_ITEM15_P167_S4	The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases, may be indefinite.
837465_12_ITEM15_P167_S5	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be obligated to make.
837465_12_ITEM15_P168_S0	Historically, costs incurred to settle claims related to indemnities have not been material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_12_ITEM15_P168_S1	In addition, the Company believes the likelihood is remote that material payments will be required under the indemnities, commitments and guarantees described above.
837465_12_ITEM15_P168_S2	The fair value of indemnities, commitments and guarantees that the Company issued during the year ended December 31, 2011 was not material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_12_ITEM15_P169_S0	The Company has entered into employment contracts with certain of the Company s officers.
837465_12_ITEM15_P169_S1	These contracts generally provide for severance benefits, including salary continuation, if employment is terminated by the Company for convenience or by the officer for substantial cause.
837465_12_ITEM15_P169_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recognized $16,329,000 in severance benefits in connection with the Reorganization and Reinvestment Initiatives announced in June 2011 (see Note 3).
837465_12_ITEM15_P169_S3	In addition, in order to assure that the officers would continue to provide independent leadership consistent with the Company s best interests in the event of an actual or threatened change in control of the Company, the contracts also generally provide for certain protections in the event of such a change in control.
837465_12_ITEM15_P169_S4	These protections include the payment of certain severance benefits, including salary continuation, upon the termination of employment following a change in control.
837465_12_ITEM15_P170_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company s foreign currency exchange contracts are measured and reported on a fair value basis in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ).
837465_12_ITEM15_P170_S1	ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements.
837465_12_ITEM15_P170_S2	ASC 820 enables the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values.
837465_12_ITEM15_P170_S3	ASC 820 requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value will be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: Observable market based inputs that are corroborated by market data Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data The following table summarizes the valuation of the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts by the above pricing levels as of the valuation dates listed (in thousands): The fair value of the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts is determined based on observable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
837465_12_ITEM15_P170_S4	Foreign currency derivatives on the balance sheet are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the statement of operations.
837465_12_ITEM15_P170_S5	The Company measures certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at least annually or when certain indicators are present.
837465_12_ITEM15_P170_S6	These assets include property, plant and equipment, goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets that are written down to fair value when they are held for sale or determined to be impaired.
837465_12_ITEM15_P170_S7	During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, certain non-amortizing intangible assets were written down to their implied fair value, resulting in impairment charges of $5,413,000 and $7,547,000, respectively (see Note 9).
837465_12_ITEM15_P170_S8	In addition, in 2011, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $1,120,000 related to goodwill of its Australian reporting unit (see Note 9).
837465_12_ITEM15_P171_S0	The implied fair values of the non-amortizing intangibles and goodwill were based on significant unobservable inputs, and as a result, the fair value measurements are classified as Level 3.
837465_12_ITEM15_P172_S0	The Company s operating segments are organized on the basis of products and include golf clubs and golf balls.
837465_12_ITEM15_P172_S1	The golf clubs segment consists primarily of Callaway Golf and Top-Flite woods, hybrids, irons, wedges and putters as well as Odyssey putters, pre-owned clubs, GPS on-course range finders, other golf-related accessories and royalties from licensing of the Company s trademarks and service marks.
837465_12_ITEM15_P172_S2	The golf balls segment consists primarily of Callaway Golf and Top-Flite golf balls that are designed, manufactured and sold by the Company.
837465_12_ITEM15_P172_S3	There are no significant intersegment transactions.
837465_12_ITEM15_P173_S0	The table below contains information utilized by management to evaluate its operating segments.
837465_12_ITEM15_P174_S0	(1) Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
837465_12_ITEM15_P175_S0	(5) Identifiable assets are comprised of net inventory, certain property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill.
837465_12_ITEM15_P175_S1	Reconciling items represent unallocated corporate assets not segregated between the two segments.
837465_12_ITEM15_P176_S0	(7) Total identifiable assets for 2010 and 2009 have been corrected from the amounts previously reported to reflect a decrease in net deferred tax assets relating to periods previously reported.
837465_12_ITEM15_P176_S1	This correction resulted in a $879,000 decrease to short-term net deferred tax assets, a $8,088,000 decrease to long-term net deferred tax assets and a decrease to shareholders equity of $8,967,000 (see Note 16).
837465_12_ITEM15_P177_S0	The Company s net sales by product category are as follows:
837465_12_ITEM15_P178_S0	(1) Certain prior period amounts were reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
837465_12_ITEM15_P179_S0	The Company markets its products in the United States and internationally, with its principal international markets being Japan and Europe.
837465_12_ITEM15_P179_S1	The tables below contain information about the geographical areas in which the Company operates.
837465_12_ITEM15_P179_S2	Revenues are attributed to the location to which the product was shipped.
837465_12_ITEM15_P179_S3	Long-lived assets are based on location of domicile.
837465_12_ITEM15_P180_S0	Transactions with Related Parties The Callaway Golf Company Foundation (the Foundation ) oversees and administers charitable giving for the Company and makes grants to carefully selected organizations.
837465_12_ITEM15_P180_S1	Officers of the Company also serve as directors of the Foundation and the Company s employees provide accounting and administrative services for the Foundation.
837465_12_ITEM15_P180_S2	During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company did not make any contributions to the Foundation.
837465_12_ITEM15_P181_S0	(2) Net loss and net loss allocable to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2011 have been corrected from the amounts previously reported to correct an overstatement in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets.
837465_12_ITEM15_P181_S1	As a result of this correction, net loss and net loss allocable to common shareholders were decreased by $4,498,000, and loss per common share decreased from $(1.03) per share to $(0.96) per share.
837465_12_ITEM15_P181_S2	This will be reflected in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements on the Company s 2012 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
837465_12_ITEM15_P182_S0	(6) Earnings per share is computed individually for each of the quarters presented; therefore, the sum of the quarterly earnings per share may not necessarily equal the total for the year.
837465_12_ITEM15_P183_S0	On February 16, 2012, the Company completed the sale of its Ben Hogan brand, which included all trademarks, service marks, and certain other intellectual property as well as license arrangements for apparel and accessories under the Ben Hogan brand name, for net proceeds of approximately $6,800,000.

837465_13_ITEM1_P16_S2	In addition, the Company has a golf ball manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts, and also utilizes contract manufacturers in China and Taiwan for golf balls.
837465_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	Both the golf club assembly process and golf ball manufacturing process utilize raw materials that are obtained from suppliers both internationally and within the United States.
837465_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, most of the Company s golf club production volume was made in regions outside of the United States.

837465_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Certain Factors Affecting Callaway Golf Company The Company s business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We urge you to carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those risks set forth under the heading entitled Important Notice to Investors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, and in other documents that the Company files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, before making any investment decision with respect to the Company s securities.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop, the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Under these circumstances, the trading prices of the Company s securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in the Company s securities.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Unfavorable economic conditions could have a negative impact on consumer discretionary spending and therefore negatively impact the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The Company sells golf clubs, golf balls and golf accessories.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These products are recreational in nature and are therefore discretionary purchases for consumers.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases of golf products during favorable economic conditions and when consumers are feeling confident and prosperous.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Discretionary spending is also affected by many other factors, including general business conditions, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxes, and consumer confidence in future economic conditions.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Purchases of the Company s products could decline during periods when disposable income is lower, or during periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P1_S5	A significant or prolonged decline in general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that adversely affect consumer discretionary spending, whether in the United States or in the Company s international markets, could result in reduced sales of the Company s products, which could have a negative impact on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The Company s operating results, financial condition and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected by the ongoing debt crisis in Europe and elsewhere and by related global economic conditions.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The ongoing debt crisis in the Eurozone and the related European financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the European currencies, including the Euro, to further deteriorate, thus further reducing the purchasing power of European customers.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	In addition, the European crisis is contributing to instability in global credit markets.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	The world has experienced a global macroeconomic downturn, and if global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in Europe, the United States or other key markets, remain uncertain, persist, or deteriorate further, consumer purchasing power and demand for Company products could decline, which may have a material adverse impact on the Company s operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	A severe or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our customers financial condition, their levels of business activity and their ability to pay trade obligations.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The Company primarily sells its products to golf equipment retailers directly and through wholly-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries, and to foreign distributors.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally requires no collateral from these customers.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Historically, the Company s bad debt expense has been low.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	flows of our customers, including the ability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and to pay their trade obligations.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	This could result in increased delinquent or uncollectible accounts for some of the Company s significant customers.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	A failure by the Company s customers to pay on a timely basis a significant portion of outstanding account receivable balances would adversely impact the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	The Company has significant international sales and purchases, and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the Company s results of operations.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	A significant portion of the Company s purchases and sales is international, and the Company conducts transactions in approximately 19 currencies worldwide.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Conducting business in such various currencies exposes the Company to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In addition, the Company s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	As a result, transactions conducted in foreign currencies must be translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes based upon the applicable foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Fluctuations in these foreign currency exchange rates therefore may positively or negatively affect the Company s reported financial results and can significantly affect period-over-period comparisons.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The effect of the translation of foreign currencies on the Company s financial results can be significant.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The Company therefore engages in certain hedging activities to mitigate over time the impact of the translation of foreign currencies on the Company s financial results.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The Company s hedging activities can reduce, but will not eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The extent to which the Company s hedging activities mitigate the effects of foreign currency translation varies based upon many factors, including the amount of transactions being hedged.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Other factors that could affect the effectiveness of the Company s hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts, volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Since the hedging activities are designed to reduce volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar but also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The Company s future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts business.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Foreign currency fluctuations can also affect the prices at which products are sold in the Company s international markets.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	The Company therefore adjusts its pricing based in part upon fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Significant unanticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates make it more difficult for the Company to manage pricing in its international markets.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P7_S4	If the Company is unable to adjust its pricing in a timely manner to counteract the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, the Company s pricing may not be competitive in the marketplace and the Company s financial results in its international markets could be adversely affected.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P7_S5	The Company s obligations and certain financial covenants contained under its existing credit facility expose it to risks that could materially and adversely affect its liquidity, business, operating results, financial condition and ability to make any dividend or other payments on its capital stock.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Company s primary credit facility is a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (as amended, the ABL Facility ), comprised of a U.S. facility, a Canadian facility and a United Kingdom facility, in each case subject to borrowing base availability under the applicable facility.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are secured by certain assets, including inventory and accounts receivable, of the Company s U.S., Canadian and U.K. legal entities.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The Company s borrowing is limited by the availability ratio, which is expressed as a percentage, of (a) the average daily availability under the ABL Facility to (b) the sum of the Canadian, the U.K. and the U.S. borrowing bases, as adjusted.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	All applicable margins can be permanently reduced by 0.25% if EBITDA, as defined in the ABL Facility, meets or exceeds $25.0 million over any trailing twelve-month period, and can be permanently reduced by an additional 0.25% if EBITDA meets or exceeds $50.0 million over any trailing twelve-month period.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The ABL Facility includes certain restrictions including, among other things, restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, liens, dividends and other restricted payments, asset sales, investments, mergers, acquisitions and affiliate transactions.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Additionally, the Company will be subject to compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant during, and continuing 30 days after, any period in which the Company s borrowing base availability falls below $25.0 million.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	If the Company experiences a decline in revenues or adjusted EBITDA, the Company may have difficulty paying interest and principal amounts due on its ABL Facility or other indebtedness and meeting certain of the financial covenants contained in the ABL Facility.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If the Company is unable to make required payments under the ABL Facility, or if the Company fails to comply with the various covenants and other requirements of the ABL Facility or other indebtedness, the Company would be in default thereunder, which would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate the maturity thereof.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Any default under the ABL Facility or other indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s liquidity, business, operating results and financial condition and ability to make any dividend or other payments on the Company s capital stock.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P9_S5	See Liquidity and Capital Resources Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility below for further discussion of the terms of the ABL Facility.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In addition to cash on hand as well as cash generated from operations, the Company relies on its ABL Facility to manage seasonal fluctuations in liquidity and to provide additional liquidity when the Company s operating cash flows are not sufficient to fund the Company s requirements.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Over the past four years, the Company has experienced revenue declines and incurred significant losses, including negative cash flows from operations in 2012.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The Company s ability to generate sufficient positive cash flows from operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including future economic trends and conditions, the success of the Company s 2012 restructuring initiatives, demand for the Company s products, foreign currency exchange rates, and other risks and uncertainties applicable to the Company and its business.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows to fund its business due to a further decline in sales or otherwise, and is unable to reduce its manufacturing costs and operating expenses to offset such decline, the Company will need to increase its reliance on the ABL Facility for needed liquidity.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If the ABL Facility is not available or sufficient and the Company could not secure alternative financing arrangements, the Company s future operations would be significantly, adversely affected.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P11_S4	If the Company is unable to successfully manage the frequent introduction of new products that satisfy changing consumer preferences, it could significantly and adversely impact its financial performance and prospects for future growth.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The Company s main products, like those of its competitors, generally have life cycles of two years or less, with sales occurring at a much higher rate in the first year than in the second.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Factors driving these short product life cycles include the rapid introduction of competitive products and quickly changing consumer preferences.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	In this marketplace, a substantial portion of the Company s annual revenues is generated each year by products that are in their first year of their product life cycle.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	These marketplace conditions raise a number of issues that the Company must successfully manage.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	For example, the Company must properly anticipate consumer preferences and design products that meet those preferences while also complying with significant restrictions imposed by the Rules of Golf (see further discussion of the Rules of Golf below) or its new products will not achieve sufficient market success to compensate for the usual decline in sales experienced by products already in the market.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Second, the Company s research and development and supply chain groups face constant pressures to design, develop, source and supply new products that perform better than their predecessors many of which incorporate new or otherwise untested technology, suppliers or inputs.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Third, for new products to generate equivalent or greater revenues than their predecessors, they must either maintain the same or higher sales levels with the same or higher pricing, or exceed the performance of their predecessors in one or both of those areas.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Fourth, the relatively short window of opportunity for launching and selling new products requires great precision in forecasting demand and assuring that supplies are ready and delivered during the critical selling periods.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Should the Company not successfully manage all of the risks associated with this rapidly moving marketplace, the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be significantly adversely affected.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	A reduction in the number of rounds of golf played or in the number of golf participants could adversely affect the Company s sales.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Company generates substantially all of its revenues from the sale of golf-related products, including golf clubs, golf balls and golf accessories.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The demand for golf-related products in general, and golf balls in particular, is directly related to the number of golf participants and the number of rounds of golf being played by these participants.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If golf participation or the number of rounds of golf played decreases, sales of the Company s products may be adversely affected.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	In the future, the overall dollar volume of the market for golf-related products may not grow or may decline.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In addition, the demand for golf products is also directly related to the popularity of magazines, cable channels and other media dedicated to golf, television coverage of golf tournaments and attendance at golf events.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P15_S5	The Company depends on the exposure of its products through advertising and the media or at golf tournaments and events.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Any significant reduction in television coverage of, or attendance at, golf tournaments and events or any significant reduction in the popularity of golf magazines or golf channels, could reduce the visibility of the Company s brand and could adversely affect the Company s sales.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P15_S7	The Company may have limited opportunities for future growth in sales of golf clubs and golf balls.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P15_S8	In order for the Company to significantly grow its sales of golf clubs or golf balls, the Company must either increase its share of the market for golf clubs or balls, or the market for golf clubs or balls must grow.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P15_S9	The Company already has a significant share of worldwide sales of golf clubs and golf balls and the golf industry is very competitive.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P15_S10	As such, gaining incremental market share quickly or at all is difficult.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P15_S11	Therefore, opportunities for additional market share may be limited given the challenging competitive nature of the golf industry.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P15_S12	The Company also believes that overall dollar volume of the worldwide market for golf equipment sales has declined over the past five years.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P15_S13	In the future, the overall dollar volume of worldwide sales of golf clubs or golf balls may not grow or may continue to decline.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If the Company inaccurately forecasts demand for its products, it may manufacture either insufficient or excess quantities, which, in either case, could adversely affect its financial performance.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The Company plans its manufacturing capacity based upon the forecasted demand for its products.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The nature of the Company s business makes it difficult to quickly adjust its manufacturing capacity if actual demand for its products exceeds or is less than forecasted demand.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If actual demand for its products exceeds the forecasted demand, the Company may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of new products in time to fulfill actual demand, which could limit the Company s sales and adversely affect its financial performance.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P16_S4	On the other hand, if actual demand is less than the forecasted demand for its products, the Company could produce excess quantities, resulting in excess inventories and related obsolescence charges that could adversely affect the Company s financial performance.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P16_S5	The Company depends on single source or a limited number of suppliers for some of its products, and the loss of any of these suppliers could harm its business.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Company is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for its clubheads and shafts, some of which are single sourced.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Furthermore, some of the Company s products require specially developed manufacturing techniques and processes which make it difficult to identify and utilize alternative suppliers quickly.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, many of the Company s suppliers are not well capitalized and prolonged unfavorable economic conditions could increase the risk that they will go out of business.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	significant production delays or disruption to its business.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The Company also depends on a single or a limited number of suppliers for the materials it uses to make its golf balls.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Many of these materials are customized for the Company.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Any delay or interruption in such supplies could have a material adverse impact upon the Company s golf ball business.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P18_S4	If the Company did experience any such delays or interruptions, the Company may not be able to find adequate alternative suppliers at a reasonable cost or without significant disruption to its business.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P18_S5	A significant disruption in the operations of the Company s golf club assembly and golf ball manufacturing and assembly facilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company s sales, profitability and results of operations.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A significant disruption at any of the Company s golf club or golf ball manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and in regions outside the U.S., or at the third-party logistics sites in the U.S. and Canada, could materially and adversely affect the Company s sales, profitability and results of operations.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	New regulations related to conflict minerals will require the Company to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing the Company s products.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	On August 22, 2012, the Commission adopted rules requiring disclosure related to sourcing of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The new rules, which are effective for calendar 2013 and require a report to be filed by May 31, 2014, require companies to, under specified circumstances, undertake due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The Company s products may contain some of the specified minerals.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	As a result, the Company may incur additional expenses in connection with complying with the new rules, including with respect to any due diligence that is required under the new rules.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In addition, the implementation of the new rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company s products.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P20_S5	There may only be a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free conflict minerals, and the Company cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain necessary conflict free conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Because the Company s supply chain is complex, the Company may also not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in the Company s products through the due diligence procedures that the Company implements, which may harm the Company s reputation.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P20_S7	If the Company is unable to obtain at reasonable costs materials or electricity necessary for the manufacture of its products, its business could be adversely affected.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The Company s size has made it a large consumer of certain materials, including steel, titanium alloys, carbon fiber and rubber.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The Company does not produce these materials itself, and must rely on its ability to obtain adequate supplies in the world marketplace in competition with other users of such materials.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In the future, the Company may not be able to obtain its requirements for such materials at a reasonable price or at all.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	An interruption in the supply of the materials used by the Company or a significant change in costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Company s golf club and golf ball manufacturing facilities use, among other resources, significant quantities of electricity to operate.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	An interruption in the supply of electricity or a significant increase in the cost of electricity could have a significant adverse effect upon the Company s results of operations.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	A disruption in the service or a significant increase in the cost of the Company s primary delivery and shipping services for its products and component parts could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The Company uses United Parcel Service ( UPS ) for substantially all ground shipments of products to its U.S. customers.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The Company uses air carriers and ocean shipping services for most of its international shipments of products.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Furthermore, many of the components the Company uses to build its golf clubs, including clubheads and shafts, are shipped to the Company via air carrier and ship services.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P24_S3	If there is any significant interruption in service by such providers or at airports or shipping ports, the Company may be unable to engage alternative suppliers or to receive or ship goods through alternate sites in order to deliver its products or components in a timely and cost-efficient manner.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P24_S4	As a result, the Company could experience manufacturing delays, increased manufacturing and shipping costs, and lost sales as a result of missed delivery deadlines and product demand cycles.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Any significant interruption in UPS services, air carrier services or ship services could have a material adverse effect upon the Company s business.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Furthermore, if the cost of delivery or shipping services were to increase significantly and the additional costs could not be covered by product pricing, the Company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The Company faces intense competition in each of its markets and if it is unable to maintain a competitive advantage, loss of market share, revenue, or profitability may result.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The golf club business is highly competitive, and is served by a number of well-established and well-financed companies with recognized brand names.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	New product introductions, price reductions, consignment sales, extended payment terms, closeouts, including closeouts of products that were recently commercially successful, and significant tour and advertising spending by competitors continue to generate intense market competition.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Furthermore, continued downward pressure on pricing in the market for new clubs could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s pre-owned club business as the gap narrows between the cost of a new club and a pre-owned club.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Successful marketing activities, discounted pricing, consignment sales, extended payment terms or new product introductions by competitors could negatively impact the Company s future sales.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The golf ball business is also highly competitive.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	There are a number of well-established and well-financed competitors, including one competitor with an estimated U.S. market share of approximately 50%.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	As the Company s competitors continue to incur significant costs in the areas of advertising, tour and other promotional support, the Company will continue to incur significant expenses in both tour and advertising support and product development.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Unless there is a change in competitive conditions, these competitive pressures and increased costs will continue to adversely affect the profitability of the Company s golf ball business.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The Company s accessories include golf bags, golf gloves, golf footwear, golf apparel and other items.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The Company faces significant competition in every region with respect to each of these product categories.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In most cases, the Company is not the market leader with respect to its accessory markets.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P28_S3	The Company s golf club and golf ball business has a concentrated customer base.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P28_S4	The loss of one or more of the Company s top customers could have a significant effect on the Company s golf club and golf ball sales.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P28_S5	On a consolidated basis, no one customer that distributes golf clubs or golf balls in the United States accounted for more than 7% of the Company s consolidated revenues in 2012, compared to 6% in both 2011 and 2010.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P28_S6	On a segment basis, in 2012, the top five golf club and golf ball customers accounted for approximately 14% and 17% of the Company s total consolidated golf club and golf ball sales, respectively.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P28_S7	A loss of one or more of these customers could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s golf club and golf ball sales.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	International political instability and terrorist activities may decrease demand for the Company s products and disrupt its business.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Terrorist activities and armed conflicts could have an adverse effect upon the United States or worldwide economy and could cause decreased demand for the Company s products as consumers attention and interest are diverted from golf and become focused on issues relating to these events.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	If such events disrupt domestic or international air, ground or sea shipments, or the operation of the Company s manufacturing facilities, the Company s ability to obtain the materials necessary to manufacture its products and to deliver customer orders would be harmed, which would have a significant adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Such events can negatively impact tourism, which could adversely affect the Company s sales to retailers at resorts and other vacation destinations.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P29_S4	In addition, the occurrence of political instability and/or terrorist activities generally restricts travel to and from the affected areas, making it more difficult in general to manage the company s international operations.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P29_S5	The Company s business could be harmed by the occurrence of natural disasters or pandemic diseases.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P29_S6	The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, tsunami, fire, flood or hurricane, or the outbreak of a pandemic disease, could significantly adversely affect the Company s business.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P29_S7	A natural disaster or a pandemic disease could significantly adversely affect both the demand for the Company s products as well as the supply of the components used to make the Company s products.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P29_S8	Demand for golf products also could be negatively affected as consumers in the affected regions restrict their recreational activities and as tourism to those areas declines.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P29_S9	If the Company s suppliers experienced a significant disruption in their business as a result of a natural disaster or pandemic disease, the Company s ability to obtain the necessary components to make its products could be significantly adversely affected.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P29_S10	In addition, the occurrence of a natural disaster or the outbreak of a pandemic disease generally restricts the travel to and from the affected areas, making it more difficult in general to manage the Company s international operations.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P29_S11	The Company s business and operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could result in fluctuations in its operating results and stock price.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The Company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The Company s first quarter sales generally represent the Company s sell-in to the golf retail channel of its golf club products for the new golf season.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	The Company s second and third quarter sales generally represent reorder business for golf clubs.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Sales of golf clubs during the second and third quarters are significantly affected not only by the sell-through of the Company s products that were sold into the channel during the first quarter but also by the sell-through of products by the Company s competitors.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Retailers are sometimes reluctant to reorder the Company s products in significant quantities when they already have excess inventory of products of the Company or its competitors.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The Company s sales of golf balls are generally associated with the level of rounds played in the areas where the Company s products are sold.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Therefore, golf ball sales tend to be greater in the second and third quarters, when the weather is good in most of the Company s key markets and rounds played are up.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Golf ball sales are also stimulated by product introductions as the retail channel takes on initial supplies.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Like those of golf clubs, reorders of golf balls depend on the rate of sell-through.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The Company s sales during the fourth quarter are generally significantly less than those of the other quarters because in many of the Company s principal markets fewer people are playing golf during that time of year due to cold weather.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Furthermore, the Company generally announces its new product line in the fourth quarter to allow retailers to plan for the new golf season.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Such early announcements of new products could cause golfers, and therefore the Company s customers, to defer purchasing additional golf equipment until the Company s new products are available.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Such deferments could have a material adverse effect upon sales of the Company s current products or result in closeout sales at reduced prices.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The seasonality of the Company s business could be exacerbated by the adverse effects of unusual or severe weather conditions as well as by severe weather conditions caused by climate change on the Company s business.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Due to the seasonality of the Company s business, the Company s business can be significantly adversely affected by unusual or severe weather conditions and by severe weather conditions caused by climate change.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Unfavorable weather conditions generally result in fewer golf rounds played, which generally results in reduced demand for all golf products, and in particular, golf balls.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Furthermore, catastrophic storms can negatively affect golf rounds played both during the storms and afterward, as storm damaged golf courses are repaired and golfers focus on repairing the damage to their homes, businesses and communities.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Consequently, sustained adverse weather conditions, especially during the warm weather months, could materially affect the Company s sales.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of the Company s total assets and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations and shareholders equity.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	The Company s goodwill and intangible assets consist of goodwill from acquisitions, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, patents, and other intangible assets.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Accounting rules require the evaluation of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Such indicators include a sustained decline in the Company s stock price or market capitalization, adverse changes in economic or market conditions or prospects, and changes in the Company s operations.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	An asset is considered to be impaired when its carrying value exceeds its fair value.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The Company determines the fair value of an asset based upon the discounted cash flows expected to be realized from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	If in conducting an impairment evaluation the Company determines that the carrying value of an asset exceeded its fair value, the Company would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P37_S2	If a significant amount of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets were deemed to be impaired, the Company s results of operations and shareholders equity would be significantly adversely affected.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P37_S3	The Company s ability to utilize all or a portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets may be limited significantly if the Company experiences an ownership change.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P37_S4	The Company has a significant amount of U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards and other losses.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P37_S5	The Company s ability to utilize the losses to offset future taxable income may be limited significantly if the Company were to experience an ownership change as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
837465_13_ITEM1A_P37_S6	In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in ownership of the Company s stock by 5-percent shareholders (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P37_S7	The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred for purposes of Section 382 is complex and requires significant judgment.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P37_S8	The extent to which the Company s ability to utilize the losses is limited as a result of such an ownership change depends on many variables, including the value of the Company s stock at the time of the ownership change.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P37_S9	The Company continues to monitor changes in ownership.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P37_S10	If such a cumulative increase did occur in any three year period and the Company were limited in the amount of losses it could use to offset taxable income, the Company s results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P37_S11	Changes in equipment standards under applicable Rules of Golf could adversely affect the Company s business.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P37_S12	The Company seeks to have its new golf club and golf ball products satisfy the standards published by the USGA and The R A in the Rules of Golf because these standards are generally followed by golfers, both professional and amateur, within their respective jurisdictions.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	followed in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and The R A publishes rules that are generally followed in most other countries throughout the world.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	However, the Rules of Golf as published by The R A and the USGA are virtually the same, and are intended to be so pursuant to a Joint Statement of Principles issued in 2001.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	In the future, existing USGA and/or R A standards may be altered in ways that adversely affect the sales of the Company s current or future products.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	If a change in rules were adopted and caused one or more of the Company s current or future products to be nonconforming, the Company s sales of such products would be adversely affected.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	The Company s sales and business could be materially and adversely affected if professional golfers do not endorse or use the Company s products.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The Company establishes relationships with professional golfers in order to evaluate and promote Callaway Golf and Odyssey branded products.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The Company has entered into endorsement arrangements with members of the various professional tours, including the Champions Tour, the PGA Tour, the LPGA Tour, the PGA European Tour, the Japan Golf Tour and the Nationwide Tour.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	While most professional golfers fulfill their contractual obligations, some have been known to stop using a sponsor s products despite contractual commitments.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If certain of the Company s professional endorsers were to stop using the Company s products contrary to their endorsement agreements, the Company s business could be adversely affected in a material way by the negative publicity or lack of endorsement.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The Company believes that professional usage of its golf clubs and golf balls contributes to retail sales.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The Company therefore spends a significant amount of money to secure professional usage of its products.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Many other companies, however, also aggressively seek the patronage of these professionals and offer many inducements, including significant cash incentives and specially designed products.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	There is a great deal of competition to secure the representation of tour professionals.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	As a result, it is expensive to attract and retain such tour professionals.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	The inducements offered by other companies could result in a decrease in usage of the Company s products by professional golfers or limit the Company s ability to attract other tour professionals.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P43_S3	A decline in the level of professional usage of the Company s products could have a material adverse effect on the Company s sales and business.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Failure to adequately enforce the Company s intellectual property rights could adversely affect its reputation and sales.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The golf club industry, in general, has been characterized by widespread imitation of popular club designs.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The Company has an active program of monitoring, investigating and enforcing its proprietary rights against companies and individuals who market or manufacture counterfeits and knockoff products.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	The Company asserts its rights against infringers of its copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade dress.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P45_S2	However, these efforts may not be successful in reducing sales of golf products by these infringers.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Additionally, other golf club manufacturers may be able to produce successful golf clubs which imitate the Company s designs without infringing any of the Company s copyrights, patents, trademarks, or trade dress.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P45_S4	The failure to prevent or limit such infringers or imitators could adversely affect the Company s reputation and sales.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P45_S5	The Company may become subject to intellectual property suits that could cause it to incur significant costs or pay significant damages or that could prohibit it from selling its products.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P45_S6	The Company s competitors also seek to obtain patent, trademark, copyright or other protection of their proprietary rights and designs for golf clubs and golf balls.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P45_S7	From time to time, third parties have claimed or may claim in the future that the Company s products infringe upon their proprietary rights.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P45_S8	The Company evaluates any such claims and, where appropriate, has obtained or sought to obtain licenses or other business arrangements.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P45_S9	To date, there have been no significant interruptions in the Company s business as a result of any claims of infringement.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P45_S10	However, in the future, intellectual property claims could force the Company to alter its existing products or withdraw them from the market or could delay the introduction of new products.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Various patents have been issued to the Company s competitors in the golf industry and these competitors may assert that the Company s golf products infringe their patent or other proprietary rights.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	If the Company s golf products are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights, the Company may be unable to obtain a license to use such technology, and it could incur substantial costs to redesign its products or to defend legal actions.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Recent changes to U.S. patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office could adversely affect the Company s ability to protect its intellectual property.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the Leahy-Smith Act ) includes a number of significant changes to the U.S. patent laws, such as, among other things, changing from a first to invent to a first inventor to file system, establishing new procedures for challenging patents and establishing different methods for invalidating patents.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P47_S1	The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is still in the process of implementing regulations relating to these changes, and the courts have yet to address many of the new provisions of the Leahy-Smith Act.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Some of these changes or potential changes may not be advantageous to the Company, and it may become more difficult to obtain adequate patent protection or to enforce the Company s patents against third parties.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P47_S3	While the Company cannot predict the impact of the Leahy-Smith Act at this time, these changes or potential changes could increase the costs and uncertainties surrounding the prosecution of the Company s patent applications and adversely affect the Company s ability to protect its intellectual property.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The Company s brands may be damaged by the actions of its licensees.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The Company licenses its trademarks to third-party licensees who produce, market and sell their products bearing the Company s trademarks.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	The Company chooses its licensees carefully and imposes upon such licensees various restrictions on the products, and on the manner, on which such trademarks may be used.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In addition, the Company requires its licensees to abide by certain standards of conduct and the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P49_S3	However, if a licensee fails to adhere to these requirements, the Company s brands could be damaged.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P49_S4	The Company s brands could also be damaged if a licensee becomes insolvent or by any negative publicity concerning a licensee or if the licensee does not maintain good relationships with its customers or consumers, many of which are also the Company s customers and consumers.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P49_S5	Sales of the Company s products by unauthorized retailers or distributors could adversely affect the Company s authorized distribution channels and harm the Company s reputation.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P49_S6	Some of the Company s products find their way to unauthorized outlets or distribution channels.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P49_S7	This gray market for the Company s products can undermine authorized retailers and foreign wholesale distributors who promote and support the Company s products, and can injure the Company s image in the minds of its customers and consumers.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P49_S8	On the other hand, stopping such commerce could result in a potential decrease in sales to those customers who are selling the Company s products to unauthorized distributors or an increase in sales returns over historical levels.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P49_S9	While the Company has taken some lawful steps to limit commerce of its products in the gray market in both the United States and abroad, it has not stopped such commerce.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The Company has significant international operations and is exposed to risks associated with doing business globally.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	The Company s management believes that controlling the distribution of its products in certain major markets in the world has been and will be an element in the future growth and success of the Company.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The Company sells and distributes its products directly in many key international markets in Europe, Asia, North America and elsewhere around the world.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	These activities have resulted and will continue to result in investments in inventory, accounts receivable, employees, corporate infrastructure and facilities.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P51_S2	In addition, there are a limited number of suppliers of golf club components in the United States, and the Company has increasingly become more reliant on suppliers and vendors located outside of the United States.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	international suppliers and vendors, will continue to require the dedication of management and other Company resources.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The Company manufactures most of its products outside of the United States.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P53_S1	As a result of this international business, the Company is exposed to increased risks inherent in conducting business outside of the United States.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P53_S2	In addition to foreign currency risks, these risks include:
837465_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Increased exposure to interruptions in air carrier or ship services.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Any significant adverse change in circumstances or conditions could have a significant adverse effect upon the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P55_S2	We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The Company relies on complex information systems for management of its manufacturing, distribution, sales and other functions.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P56_S1	If the Company s information systems fail to perform these functions adequately or if the Company experiences an interruption in their operation, including a breach in cyber security, its business and results of operations could suffer.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	All of the Company s major operations, including manufacturing, distribution, sales and accounting, are dependent upon the Company s complex information systems.
837465_13_ITEM1A_P57_S1	The Company s information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:

837465_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the related notes and the Important Notice to Investors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements that appear elsewhere in this report.
837465_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations, financial condition and liquidity are based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
837465_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, shareholders equity, sales and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
837465_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
837465_13_ITEM7_P1_S3	Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
837465_13_ITEM7_P1_S4	On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business and new information as it becomes available.
837465_13_ITEM7_P1_S5	Management believes the critical accounting policies discussed below affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
837465_13_ITEM7_P1_S6	For a complete discussion of all of the Company s significant accounting policies, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, as products are shipped to customers, net of an allowance for sales returns and accruals for sales programs.
837465_13_ITEM7_P1_S7	The Company records a reserve for anticipated returns through a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the period that the related sales are recorded.
837465_13_ITEM7_P1_S8	Sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through of products.
837465_13_ITEM7_P1_S9	In addition, from time to time, the Company offers sales programs that allow for specific returns.
837465_13_ITEM7_P1_S10	The Company records a reserve for anticipated returns related to these sales programs based on the terms of the sales program as well as historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through of products.
837465_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Historically, the Company s actual sales returns have not been materially different from management s original estimates.
837465_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance for sales returns.
837465_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	However, if the actual costs of sales returns are significantly different than the recorded estimated allowance, the Company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
837465_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the recorded estimated allowance for 2012 sales returns, pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2012 would have been increased by approximately $0.6 million.
837465_13_ITEM7_P2_S4	The Company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings.
837465_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program, management s forecast of future product demand, and historical customer participation in similar programs.
837465_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Company s primary sales program, the Preferred Retailer Program, offers longer payment terms during the initial sell in period, as well as potential rebates and discounts, for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the Company, including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels, prime product placement and retailer staff training.
837465_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	Under this program, qualifying retailers can earn either discounts or rebates based upon the amount of product purchased.
837465_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	Discounts are applied and recorded at the time of sale.
837465_13_ITEM7_P4_S3	For rebates, the Company accrues an estimate of the rebate at the time of sale based on the customer s estimated qualifying current year product purchases.
837465_13_ITEM7_P4_S4	The estimate is based on the historical level of purchases, adjusted for any factors expected to affect the current year purchase levels.
837465_13_ITEM7_P4_S5	The estimated year-end rebate is adjusted quarterly based on actual purchase levels, as necessary.
837465_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	program are known as of the end of the year and paid to customers shortly after year-end.
837465_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	In addition to the Preferred Retailer Program, the Company from time to time offers additional sales program incentive offerings which are also generally short term in nature.
837465_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Historically the Company s actual costs related to its Preferred Retailer Program and other sales programs have not been materially different than its estimates.
837465_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed.
837465_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	In addition, the Company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws.
837465_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	The Company s gift cards have no expiration.
837465_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	To determine when redemption is remote, the Company analyzes an aging of unredeemed cards (based on the date the card was last used or the activation date if the card has never been used) and compares that information with historical redemption trends.
837465_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to determine the timing of recognition of gift card revenues.
837465_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	However, if the Company is not able to accurately determine when gift card redemption is remote, the Company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
837465_13_ITEM7_P8_S3	The deferred revenue associated with outstanding gift cards decreased from $2.0 million at December 31, 2011 to $1.1 million at December 31, 2012.
837465_13_ITEM7_P8_S4	Revenues from course credits in connection with the use of the Company s uPro GPS devices are deferred when purchased and recognized on a straight-line basis over a three year period.
837465_13_ITEM7_P8_S5	Although the Company announced in July 2012 the transition of its integrated device business to a third-party based model, the Company will continue to maintain services related to course credits used in conjunction with the uPro GPS devices.
837465_13_ITEM7_P8_S6	Deferred revenue associated with unused course credits decreased to $2.5 million at December 31, 2012 from $2.9 million at December 31, 2011.
837465_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments.
837465_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	An estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, the customer s financial condition and current economic trends, all of which are subject to change.
837465_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	If the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance, the Company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected.
837465_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the 2012 recorded estimated allowance for doubtful accounts, pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2012 would have been increased by approximately $0.7 million.
837465_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value.
837465_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
837465_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	The inventory balance, which includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs, is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory.
837465_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	The estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon current inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience as well as management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand, all of which are subject to change.
837465_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	The calculation of the Company s allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand and pricing, regulatory (USGA and R A) rule changes, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence.
837465_13_ITEM7_P12_S3	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance.
837465_13_ITEM7_P12_S4	However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner, the Company may need to increase its inventory allowance, which could significantly adversely affect the Company s operating results.
837465_13_ITEM7_P12_S5	Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the 2012 recorded estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory, pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2012 would have been increased by approximately $2.4 million.
837465_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company acquires tangible and intangible assets.
837465_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and amortizing intangible assets, and investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable or exceeds its fair value.
837465_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	The Company evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually or whenever indicators that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable are present.
837465_13_ITEM7_P13_S3	Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining the amount of undiscounted cash flows directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, the timing of the impairment test, and the asset s residual value, if any.
837465_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	To determine fair value, the Company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate.
837465_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the asset and a charge to earnings.
837465_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	The Company uses its best judgment based on current facts and circumstances related to its business when making these estimates.
837465_13_ITEM7_P14_S3	However, if actual results are not consistent with the Company s estimates and assumptions used in calculating future cash flows and asset fair values, the Company may be exposed to losses that could be material.
837465_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the estimated fair values of the Company s reporting units in the U.S., United Kingdom, Canada and Korea, as well as the estimated fair values of certain trade names and trademarks, exceeded their carrying values.
837465_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	In September 2012, in connection with the Company s Cost Reduction Initiatives that were announced in July 2012, the Company committed to a plan to transition its integrated device business to a third party based model.
837465_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	As a result, the Company performed an impairment analysis and determined that the estimated discounted cash flows from the sales of uPro GPS devices were less than the carrying values of the intangible assets and goodwill associated with the uPlay, LLC acquisition, which was completed as of December 31, 2008.
837465_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	This analysis resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of $5.1 million to write-off amortizing intangible assets and goodwill associated with the uPlay, LLC acquisition, in addition to charges of $4.0 million to write-off property, plant and equipment related to uPro GPS devices.
837465_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	See Note 8 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Goodwill and Intangible Assets in this Form 10-K. In the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized impairment charges of $4.6 million, $5.4 million and $7.5 million, respectively, in connection with the trade names, trademarks and other intangible assets related to the Top-Flite and Ben Hogan brands.
837465_13_ITEM7_P16_S4	The Company determined that the carrying values of these trade names, trademarks and other intangible assets exceeded the estimated discounted future cash flows that would be generated from the use of these assets.
837465_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	In the first quarter of 2012, in an effort to simplify the Company s operations and increase focus on the Company s core Callaway and Odyssey brands, the Company sold the Top-Flite and Ben Hogan brands for net cash proceeds of $26.9 million.
837465_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	See Note 8 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Goodwill and Intangible Assets in this Form 10-K. In 2011, the Company performed an impairment analysis on goodwill related to its reporting unit in Australia.
837465_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	In completing this analysis, the Company determined that the carrying value of this reporting unit including goodwill exceeded the estimated discounted future cash flows that would be generated from this unit and as a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $1.1 million to write-off goodwill related to this reporting unit.
837465_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	See Note 8 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Goodwill and Intangible Assets in this Form 10-K.
837465_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Warranty Policy The Company has a stated two-year warranty policy for its golf clubs.
837465_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	The Company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded.
837465_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	In estimating its future warranty obligations, the Company considers various relevant factors, including the Company s stated warranty policies and practices, the historical frequency of claims, and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty.
837465_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	The Company s estimates for calculating the warranty reserve are principally based on assumptions regarding the warranty costs of each club product line over the expected warranty period.
837465_13_ITEM7_P19_S4	Where little or no claims experience may exist, the Company s warranty obligation calculation is based upon long-term historical warranty rates of similar products until sufficient data is available.
837465_13_ITEM7_P19_S5	As actual model-specific rates become available, the Company s estimates are modified to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes.
837465_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	Historically, the Company s actual warranty claims have not been materially different from management s original estimated warranty obligation.
837465_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the warranty obligation.
837465_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	However, if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims significantly exceeds the estimated warranty reserve, the Company may be exposed to losses that could be material.
837465_13_ITEM7_P20_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the 2012 recorded estimated allowance for warranty obligations, pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2012 would have been increased by approximately $0.8 million.
837465_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Income Taxes Current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year.
837465_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
837465_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	The Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
837465_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire.
837465_13_ITEM7_P22_S3	These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment, including estimates of future taxable income.
837465_13_ITEM7_P22_S4	These estimates are based on the Company s best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions.
837465_13_ITEM7_P22_S5	In 2011, as a result of this evaluation, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_13_ITEM7_P22_S6	At the end of each interim and annual reporting period, as the U.S. deferred tax assets are adjusted upwards or downwards, the associated valuation allowance and income tax expense are also adjusted.
837465_13_ITEM7_P22_S7	If sufficient positive evidence arises in the future, such as a sustained return to profitability in the U.S. business, the valuation allowance could be reversed as appropriate, decreasing income tax expense in the period that such conclusion is reached.
837465_13_ITEM7_P22_S8	The Company has concluded that with respect to non-U.S. entities, there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that the realization of its deferred tax assets is deemed to be likely, and no allowances have been established.
837465_13_ITEM7_P22_S9	In addition, the Company has discontinued recognizing income tax benefits related to its U.S. net operating losses until it is determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefits from its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_13_ITEM7_P22_S10	Pursuant to ASC Topic 740-25-6, the Company is required to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is deemed to be more likely than not that the Company would be required to pay such additional taxes.
837465_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	The Company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions.
837465_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	The preparation of these income tax returns requires the Company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by the Company.
837465_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	The Company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability, including interest and penalties, for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return.
837465_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	The Company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available.
837465_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	Historically, additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the Company s uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the Company s expectations.
837465_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	Information regarding income taxes is contained in Note 12 Income Taxes to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
837465_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Share-based Compensation The Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and non-employees based on estimated fair values.
837465_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	ASC Topic 718 further requires a reduction in share-based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	The forfeiture rate used by the Company is based on historical forfeiture trends.
837465_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	If actual forfeitures are not consistent with the Company s estimates, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods.
837465_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options and stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) at the date of grant.
837465_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the Company s expected stock price volatility, the expected dividend yield, the expected term of an option or SAR and the risk-free interest rate, which is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
837465_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected price volatility and the expected term.
837465_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	The Company uses forecasted dividends to estimate the expected dividend yield.
837465_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option or SAR.
837465_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option or SAR does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee.
837465_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for stock options.
837465_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	Compensation expense for SARs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on award s estimated fair value, which is remeasured at the end of each reporting period.
837465_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	Once vested, SARs continued to be remeasured to fair value until they are exercised.
837465_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	The Company records compensation expense for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (collectively restricted stock ) based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
837465_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	The estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares awarded.
837465_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, reduced by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Phantom stock units ( PSUs ) are a form of share-based awards that are indexed to the Company s stock and are settled in cash.
837465_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	Compensation expense for PSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the award s estimated fair value.
837465_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	Fair value is remeasured at the end of each interim reporting period through the award s settlement date and is based on the closing price of the Company s stock.
837465_13_ITEM7_P31_S3	Recent Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by this reference.
837465_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Results of Operations Overview of Business and Seasonality The Company designs, manufactures and sells high quality golf clubs and golf balls, and also sells golf accessories, such as golf bags, golf gloves, headwear and other golf-related accessories.
837465_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	In addition, the Company licenses its trademarks and service marks in exchange for a royalty fee to third parties for use on golf related accessories, including apparel, footwear, eyewear, rangefinders and practice aids.
837465_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	The Company designs its products to be technologically advanced and in this regard invests a considerable amount in research and development each year.
837465_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	The Company s golf products are designed for golfers of all skill levels, both amateur and professional.
837465_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	The Company has two operating segments that are organized on the basis of products, namely the golf clubs segment and golf balls segment.
837465_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	The golf clubs segment consists primarily of Callaway Golf woods, hybrids, irons, wedges and putters as well as Odyssey putters.
837465_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	This segment also includes other golf-related accessories described above and royalties from licensing of the Company s trademarks and service marks as well as sales of pre-owned golf clubs.
837465_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	The golf balls segment consists primarily of Callaway Golf and Top-Flite golf balls.
837465_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	The Company sold the Top-Flite brand in March 2012 (see Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
837465_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	As discussed in Note 19 Segment Information to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company s operating segments exclude a significant amount of corporate general administrative expenses and other income (expense) not utilized by management in determining segment profitability.
837465_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	In most of the regions where the Company does business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis.
837465_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	Weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year-round, except in a few markets, with many of the Company s on-course customers closing for the cold weather months.
837465_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	The Company s business is therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_13_ITEM7_P37_S3	In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season.
837465_13_ITEM7_P37_S4	This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter.
837465_13_ITEM7_P37_S5	The Company s second quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter.
837465_13_ITEM7_P37_S6	The Company s third quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but are generally less than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season.
837465_13_ITEM7_P37_S7	The Company s fourth quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company s key markets.
837465_13_ITEM7_P37_S8	However, fourth quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year.
837465_13_ITEM7_P37_S9	This seasonality, and therefore quarter to quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions.
837465_13_ITEM7_P37_S10	In general, however, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company s sales and most, if not all, of its profitability generally occurs during the first half of the year.
837465_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	Approximately half of the Company s business is conducted in regions outside of the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
837465_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	As a result, changes in foreign currency rates can have a significant effect on the Company s financial results.
837465_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	The Company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates.
837465_13_ITEM7_P38_S3	While these foreign currency exchange contracts can mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates, they do not eliminate those effects, which can be significant.
837465_13_ITEM7_P38_S4	These effects include (i) the translation of results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, (ii) the mark-to-market adjustments of certain intercompany balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies, and (iii) the mark-to-market adjustments on the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts.
837465_13_ITEM7_P38_S5	In general, the Company s overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts its business.
837465_13_ITEM7_P38_S6	During 2012, the Company s financial results were negatively affected by the translation of sales denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.
837465_13_ITEM7_P38_S7	Executive Summary The Company experienced a 6% decline in net sales and a 500 basis point decline in gross margins for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the prior year.
837465_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	the wind down of certain non-core businesses the Company exited in 2012 as well as increased sales promotions in response to the challenging marketplace combined with other actions the Company took to prepare the business for a turnaround in 2013.
837465_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	This decline in the Company s net sales and gross margins was partially offset by a $28.0 million (7%) decline in operating expenses in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a reduction in employee costs as a result of the Company s Cost Reduction Initiatives announced in July 2012.
837465_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	Although management is not satisfied with the Company s 2012 financial results on an absolute basis, the results reflect many actions that should be beneficial in the long-term.
837465_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased to $122.9 million compared to $171.8 million in the comparable period of 2011.
837465_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	Diluted loss per share decreased to $1.96 in 2012 compared to $2.82 in 2011.
837465_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	The Company s net loss for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 include the following charges (in millions):
837465_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	(1) The Company s income tax provision for 2012 and 2011 is affected by a valuation allowance against the Company s U.S. deferred tax assets and is therefore not directly correlated to the amount of its pretax loss.
837465_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	See Note 12 Income Taxes to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. The Company continues to make progress on its Cost Reduction Initiatives, which are aimed to better align the Company s cost structure with its current business levels and change the manner in which the Company approaches and operates its business.
837465_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	The actions include (i) a reduction in workforce that impacts all regions and levels of the organization, (ii) greater focus on the Company s core product lines, including licensing to third parties the rights to develop, manufacture and distribute certain non-core product lines (e.g. apparel and footwear) as well as transitioning to a third party based model for its integrated device business, and (iii) the reorganization of the Company s golf ball manufacturing supply chain, which includes the sale and lease-back of a reduced portion of the square footage of the Company s ball manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts.
837465_13_ITEM7_P41_S3	The Company expects to incur total pre-tax charges of approximately $60.0 million in connection with these initiatives, of which approximately two-thirds is expected to result in non-cash expenditures.
837465_13_ITEM7_P41_S4	To date, the Company has incurred total charges related to its Cost Reduction Initiatives of $54.2 million, of which $14.3 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2012.
837465_13_ITEM7_P41_S5	These initiatives are estimated to yield approximately $60.0 million in gross annualized savings.
837465_13_ITEM7_P41_S6	The Company continues to make solid progress on its turnaround plan.
837465_13_ITEM7_P41_S7	In addition to the Cost Reduction Initiatives discussed above, and the actions taken earlier in 2012, including the sale of the Top-Flite and Ben Hogan brands, changes in senior management, and changes in the Company s approach to product design and the sales and marketing functions, the Company also replaced a majority of its outstanding preferred stock with much less expensive 3.75% convertible notes.
837465_13_ITEM7_P41_S8	These key initiatives are all consistent with management s efforts to simplify the business, focus the team on the Company s core business of golf clubs and golf balls, and reduce its cost structure.
837465_13_ITEM7_P41_S9	Management believes that these initiatives will result in improved financial results in 2013.
837465_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	Years Ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased $52.4 million (6%) to $834.1 million compared to $886.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
837465_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	This decrease was due to a decline in sales in both the golf clubs and golf balls segments.
837465_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	The decline in sales in the golf clubs operating segment was primarily due to a decline in sales of irons and woods.
837465_13_ITEM7_P42_S3	The decline in sales in the golf balls operating segment was primarily due to the Company s sale of its Top-Flite brand earlier this year.
837465_13_ITEM7_P42_S4	These decreases were partially offset by an increase in putter sales due to the current year launch of the Company s new Metal X putter platform as well as an increase in sales of the Company s accessories and other products due to increased sales of packaged sets, apparel and GPS devices.
837465_13_ITEM7_P42_S5	The Company s net sales by operating segment are presented below (dollars in millions):
837465_13_ITEM7_P42_S6	For further discussion of each operating segment s results, see Golf Clubs Segment and Golf Balls Segment results below.
837465_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Net sales information by region is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	Net sales in the United States decreased $27.3 million (7%) to $392.1 million during 2012 compared to $419.4 million in 2011.
837465_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	The Company s sales in regions outside of the United States decreased $25.1 million to $442.0 million in 2012 compared to $467.1 million in 2011 due largely to a decline in sales in Europe and the Company s Rest of Asia region.
837465_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	This decline was partially offset by an increase in sales in Japan.
837465_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	In 2011, sales in Japan were negatively affected by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
837465_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	Additionally, the Company s reported net sales in regions outside the United States in 2012 were unfavorably affected by the translation of foreign currency sales into U.S. dollars based upon 2012 exchange rates.
837465_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	If 2011 exchange rates were applied to 2012 reported sales in regions outside the U.S. and all other factors were held constant, net sales in such regions would have been $4.9 million higher than reported during the year ended December 31, 2012.
837465_13_ITEM7_P45_S3	Gross profit decreased $63.1 million to $248.2 million in 2012 from $311.3 million in 2011.
837465_13_ITEM7_P45_S4	Gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased to 30% in 2012 compared to 35% in 2011.
837465_13_ITEM7_P45_S5	The decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to charges that were recognized in connection with the Company s Cost Reduction Initiatives that were announced in July 2012.
837465_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	In 2012, the Company s gross margin was negatively affected by charges of $36.2 million (4.3 margin points) that include (i) the write-off of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets in connection with the Company s decision to transition its integrated device business to a third party based model; (ii) the write-down of the Company s ball manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts to its estimated net selling price as a result of the sale and lease-back of a reduced portion of the square footage of this facility to better align with current needs; (iii) charges to write-down inventory related to the Company s decision to license to third parties the rights to develop, manufacture and distribute the Company s apparel and footwear product lines; (iv) charges related to reductions in workforce that impacted all regions and levels of the Company s business; and (v) charges related to the impairment of certain golf ball patents.
837465_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	In addition, gross margin was negatively affected by increased promotional activity during 2012 primarily on in-line drivers, fairway woods and irons products, as well as an increase in club component costs due to a combination of more expensive premium materials and technology incorporated into the 2012 new product line.
837465_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	These decreases were partially offset by the Company s completion of its GOS initiatives in December 2011, which resulted in lower club conversion costs.
837465_13_ITEM7_P46_S3	In 2011, gross margin was negatively affected by $20.6 million of costs (or 2.3 margin points) in connection with the GOS initiatives.
837465_13_ITEM7_P46_S4	See Segment Profitability below for further discussion of gross margins.
837465_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	Selling expenses increased by $2.8 million to $268.1 million (32% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $265.3 million (30% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2011.
837465_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	The dollar increase was primarily due to increases of $13.0 million in advertising and promotional activities, which is consistent with the Company s Reorganization and Reinvestment Initiatives announced in June 2011, in addition to a $4.6 million increase in restructuring charges associated with the Company s Cost Reduction Initiatives announced in July 2012.
837465_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $10.3 million in employee costs primarily as a result of a reduction in headcount period over period, as well as a decrease of $1.7 million in travel expenses.
837465_13_ITEM7_P47_S3	General and administrative expenses decreased by $26.0 million to $66.8 million (8% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $92.8 million (10% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2011.
837465_13_ITEM7_P47_S4	The dollar decrease was primarily due to (i) a $11.3 million decrease in employee costs primarily as a result of reductions in severance charges and headcount period over period, (ii) the recognition of a $6.6 million net gain from the sale of the Company s Top-Flite and Ben Hogan brands during the first quarter of 2012, (iii) $6.5 million in impairment charges recognized in 2011, primarily in connection with certain intangible assets related to the acquisition of Top-Flite in 2003, (iv) $3.8 million in building expenses incurred in 2011 associated with the Company s Reorganization and Reinvestment Initiatives, and (v) a $3.2 million decrease in legal expenses.
837465_13_ITEM7_P47_S5	These decreases were partially offset by a $6.2 million net gain recognized in March 2011 in connection with the sale of three of the Company s buildings.
837465_13_ITEM7_P47_S6	Research and development expenses decreased by $4.8 million to $29.5 million (4% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $34.3 million (4% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2011.
837465_13_ITEM7_P47_S7	This decrease was primarily due to a $3.4 million decrease in employee costs primarily as a result of a reduction in headcount period over period, partially offset by charges incurred in connection with the Company s Cost Reduction Initiatives announced in July 2012.
837465_13_ITEM7_P47_S8	Interest expense increased by $3.9 million to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $1.6 million in the comparable period of 2011.
837465_13_ITEM7_P47_S9	This increase was primarily due to interest and debt discount amortization expense incurred in connection with the convertible notes issued in August 2012, in addition to an increase in interest expense related to the ABL Facility.
837465_13_ITEM7_P47_S10	Other income (expense), net improved by $11.3 million to income of $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to expense of $8.1 million in the comparable period of 2011.
837465_13_ITEM7_P47_S11	This increase in income was primarily attributable to an increase in net foreign currency gains.
837465_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	The Company s provision for income taxes decreased to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $81.6 million in the comparable period of 2011.
837465_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	In 2011, the Company recorded tax expense of $52.5 million in order to establish a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets, which also resulted in the recognition of certain prepaid tax expenses of $21.6 million related to intercompany profits.
837465_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	Due to the effects of its deferred tax asset valuation allowance, the Company s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 is not comparable to the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011, as the Company s provision for income taxes is not directly correlated to the amount of its pretax losses.
837465_13_ITEM7_P48_S3	Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased to $122.9 million compared to $171.8 million in the comparable period of 2011.

837465_13_ITEM7_P61_S4	These decreases were partially offset by increases in sales in Europe and in some of the Company s emerging markets (China and India).
837465_13_ITEM7_P61_S5	The Company s reported net sales in regions outside the United States during 2011 were favorably affected by the translation of foreign currency sales into U.S. dollars based upon 2011 exchange rates.

837465_13_ITEM7_P72_S21	As of December 31, 2012, the Company s net accounts receivable decreased $24.6 million to $91.1 million from $115.7 million as of December 31, 2011.
837465_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	was primarily attributable to a decrease in net sales during 2012 compared to the prior year, partially offset by an improvement in past due receivables.
837465_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	The Company s inventory balance also fluctuates throughout the year as a result of the general seasonality of the Company s business.
837465_13_ITEM7_P73_S2	Generally, the Company s buildup of inventory levels begins during the fourth quarter and continues heavily into the first quarter as well as into the beginning of the second quarter in order to meet demand during the height of the golf season.
837465_13_ITEM7_P73_S3	Inventory levels start to decline toward the end of the second quarter and are at their lowest during the third quarter.
837465_13_ITEM7_P73_S4	Inventory levels are also impacted by the timing of new product launches.
837465_13_ITEM7_P73_S5	The Company s net inventory decreased $21.4 million to $211.7 million as of December 31, 2012 compared to $233.1 million as of December 31, 2011.
837465_13_ITEM7_P73_S6	This decrease was primarily due to a decline in apparel and footwear inventory levels resulting from the Company s transition in 2012 to a third-party based model in U.S. and Canada for the rights to develop, manufacture and distribute the Company s apparel and footwear product lines.
837465_13_ITEM7_P73_S7	In addition, the decrease in inventory was due to lower inventory levels as a result of fewer irons models offered in 2013 compared to 2012 as well as a decrease in golf ball inventory due to the sale of the Top-Flite brand in 2012.
837465_13_ITEM7_P73_S8	Net inventories as a percentage of the trailing twelve months net sales decreased to 25.4% as of December 31, 2012 compared to 26.3% as of December 31, 2011.
837465_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	The Company has an ABL Facility with Bank of America N.A. which provides a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility of up to $230.0 million, comprised of a $158.3 million U.S. facility (of which $20.0 million is available for letters of credit), a $31.7 million Canadian facility (of which $5.0 million is available for letters of credit) and a $40.0 million United Kingdom facility (of which $2.0 million is available for letters of credit), in each case subject to borrowing base availability under the applicable facility.
837465_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	The aggregate amount outstanding under the Company s letters of credit was $3.3 million at December 31, 2012.
837465_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	The amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are secured by certain assets, including inventory and accounts receivable, of the Company s U.S., Canadian and U.K. legal entities.
837465_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	As of December 31, 2012, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility and had $52.0 million of cash and cash equivalents.
837465_13_ITEM7_P75_S2	The maximum amount of Indebtedness (as defined by the ABL Facility) that could have been outstanding on December 31, 2012, after outstanding borrowings, letters of credit and certain reserves and the $25.0 million fixed charge coverage ratio covenant (defined below) was approximately $40.5 million resulting in total available liquidity of $92.5 million.
837465_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	The maximum availability under the ABL Facility fluctuates with the general seasonality of the business and increases and decreases with changes in the Company s inventory and accounts receivable balances.
837465_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	The maximum availability is at its highest during the first half of the year when the Company s inventory and accounts receivable balances are high and then decreases during the second half of the year when the Company s accounts receivable balance is lower due to an increase in cash collections.
837465_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	The average outstanding borrowings during 2012 were $50.3 million and average liquidity, defined as cash on hand combined with amounts available under the ABL Facility after outstanding borrowings, was $105.9 million.
837465_13_ITEM7_P76_S3	Amounts borrowed under the ABL Facility may be repaid and borrowed as needed.
837465_13_ITEM7_P76_S4	The entire outstanding principal amount (if any) is due and payable at maturity on June 30, 2016.
837465_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	The ABL Facility includes certain restrictions including, among other things, restrictions on incurrence of additional debt, liens, dividends and other restricted payments, asset sales, investments, mergers, acquisitions and affiliate transactions.
837465_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	As of December 31, 2012 the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the ABL Facility.
837465_13_ITEM7_P77_S2	Additionally, the Company will be subject to compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant during, and continuing 30 days after, any period in which the Company s borrowing base availability falls below $25.0 million.
837465_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	however, the Company s borrowing base availability was above $25.0 million during 2012, and as such the Company was not subject to compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio.
837465_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	The interest rate applicable to outstanding loans under the ABL Facility fluctuates depending on the Company s trailing-twelve month EBITDA (as defined by the ABL Facility) combined with the Company s availability ratio (as defined below).
837465_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	The Company s availability ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of (a) the average daily availability under the ABL Facility to (b) the sum of the Canadian, the U.K. and the U.S. borrowing bases, as adjusted.
837465_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	All applicable margins may be permanently reduced by 0.25% if EBITDA meets or exceeds $25.0 million over any trailing twelve-month period, and may be permanently reduced by an additional 0.25% if EBITDA meets or exceeds $50.0 million over any trailing twelve-month period.
837465_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	At December 31, 2012, the Company s interest rate applicable to its outstanding loans under the ABL Facility was 4.50%.
837465_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	In addition, the ABL Facility provides for monthly fees ranging from 0.375% to 0.5% of the unused portion of the ABL Facility, depending on the prior month s average daily balance of revolver loans and stated amount of letters of credit relative to lenders commitments.
837465_13_ITEM7_P80_S2	The origination fees incurred in connection with the ABL Facility totaled $4.3 million, which will be amortized into interest expense over the term of the ABL Facility agreement.
837465_13_ITEM7_P80_S3	Unamortized origination fees as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 were $3.2 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of which $0.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively, were included in other current assets and $2.3 million and $2.3 million, respectively, in other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

837465_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	The convertible notes were priced at 95.02% of the principal amount with an effective yield to maturity of 4.59% and pay interest of 3.75% per year on the principal amount, payable semiannually in arrears in cash on February 15 and August 15 of each year.
837465_13_ITEM7_P81_S2	The first payment was made on February 15, 2013.
837465_13_ITEM7_P81_S3	Net cash proceeds from the private placement transactions for cash were $46.8 million.
837465_13_ITEM7_P81_S4	The Company incurred transactional fees of $3.5 million which were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the convertible notes.
837465_13_ITEM7_P81_S5	Unamortized transaction fees as of December 31, 2012 were $3.4 million, of which $0.5 million was included in other current assets and $2.9 million in other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
837465_13_ITEM7_P81_S6	The net carrying amount of the convertible notes as of December 31, 2012 was $107.1 million.
837465_13_ITEM7_P81_S7	The unamortized discount of $5.4 million will be amortized over the remaining term of 6.62 years.
837465_13_ITEM7_P81_S8	Total interest and amortization expense recognized during 2012 was $1.7 million.
837465_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	The convertible notes are convertible, at the option of the note holder, at any time on or prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding August 15, 2019, into shares of common stock at an initial conversion rate of 133.3333 shares per $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $7.50 per share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments.
837465_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events of the Company, the Company will pay a premium on the convertible notes converted in connection with such change of control events by increasing the conversion rate on such convertible notes.
837465_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	Under certain circumstances, the Company has the right to terminate the right of note holders to convert their convertible notes.
837465_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	holder who converts its convertible notes after receiving notice of such exercise will receive a make-whole payment in cash or common stock, as the Company may elect, with respect to the convertible notes converted.
837465_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	Upon the occurrence of a change of control of the Company or a termination of trading of the common stock of the Company, note holders will have the option to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of such note holder s convertible notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the repurchased convertible notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the repurchase date.
837465_13_ITEM7_P84_S2	The convertible notes are not redeemable by the Company prior to August 15, 2015.
837465_13_ITEM7_P84_S3	On or after August 15, 2015, the convertible notes are redeemable in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.
837465_13_ITEM7_P84_S4	The convertible notes contain certain covenants including payment of principal, certain repurchase obligations and interest, obligations of the Company to convert the convertible notes, and other customary terms as defined in the indenture relating to the convertible notes.
837465_13_ITEM7_P84_S5	The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2012.
837465_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	In November 2007, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of a maximum cost to the Company of $100.0 million (the November 2007 repurchase program ).
837465_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	Under this program, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares of its common stock in the open market or in private transactions, subject to the Company s assessment of market conditions and buying opportunities.
837465_13_ITEM7_P85_S2	The November 2007 repurchase program supersedes all prior stock repurchase authorizations and will remain in effect until completed or otherwise terminated by the Board of Directors During 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 122,000 shares of its common stock under the November 2007 repurchase program at an average cost per share of $6.40 for a total cost of $0.8 million.
837465_13_ITEM7_P85_S3	The Company acquired these shares to satisfy the Company s tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting and settlement of employee restricted stock unit awards.
837465_13_ITEM7_P85_S4	The Company s repurchases of shares of common stock are recorded at cost and result in a reduction of shareholders equity.
837465_13_ITEM7_P85_S5	As of December 31, 2012, the Company remained authorized to repurchase up to an additional $72.8 million of its common stock under this program.
837465_13_ITEM7_P85_S6	The following table summarizes certain significant cash obligations as of December 31, 2012 that will affect the Company s future liquidity (in millions):
837465_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	(2) During the normal course of its business, the Company enters into agreements to purchase goods and services, including purchase commitments for production materials, endorsement agreements with professional golfers and other endorsers, employment and consulting agreements, and intellectual property licensing agreements pursuant to which the Company is required to pay royalty fees.
837465_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	It is not possible to determine the amounts the Company will ultimately be required to pay under these agreements as they are subject to many variables including performance-based bonuses, reductions in payment obligations if designated minimum performance criteria are not achieved, and severance arrangements.
837465_13_ITEM7_P86_S2	The amounts listed approximate minimum purchase obligations, base compensation, and guaranteed minimum royalty payments the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements.
837465_13_ITEM7_P86_S3	The actual amounts paid under some of these agreements may be higher or lower than the amounts included.
837465_13_ITEM7_P86_S4	In the aggregate, the actual amount paid under these obligations is likely to be higher than the amounts listed as a result of the variable nature of these obligations.
837465_13_ITEM7_P86_S5	In addition, the Company also enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders or other documentation or that are undocumented except for an invoice.
837465_13_ITEM7_P86_S6	Such unconditional purchase obligations are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected in this line item.
837465_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	(3) The Company leases certain warehouse, distribution and office facilities, vehicles and office equipment under operating leases.
837465_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	The amounts presented in this line item represent commitments for minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases.
837465_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	(4) Amount represents total uncertain income tax positions.
837465_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	For further discussion see Note 12 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. During its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions.
837465_13_ITEM7_P88_S2	These include (i) intellectual property indemnities to the Company s customers and licensees in connection with the use, sale and/or license of Company products or trademarks, (ii) indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facilities or leases, (iii) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to the goods or services provided to the Company or based on the negligence or willful misconduct of the Company and (iv) indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts.
837465_13_ITEM7_P88_S3	In addition, the Company has made contractual commitments to each of its officers and certain other employees providing for severance payments upon the termination of employment.
837465_13_ITEM7_P88_S4	The Company also has consulting agreements that provide for payment of nominal fees upon the issuance of patents and/or the commercialization of research results.
837465_13_ITEM7_P88_S5	The Company has also issued guarantees in the form of a standby letter of credit as security for contingent liabilities under certain workers compensation insurance policies.
837465_13_ITEM7_P88_S6	The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases may be indefinite.
837465_13_ITEM7_P88_S7	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be obligated to make.
837465_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	Historically, costs incurred to settle claims related to indemnities have not been material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	In addition, the Company believes the likelihood is remote that payments under the commitments and guarantees described above will have a material effect on the Company s financial condition.
837465_13_ITEM7_P89_S2	The fair value of indemnities, commitments and guarantees that the Company issued during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 was not material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_13_ITEM7_P89_S3	In addition to the contractual obligations listed above, the Company s liquidity could also be adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome with respect to claims and litigation that the Company is subject to from time to time.
837465_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	The Company s principal sources of liquidity consist of its existing cash balances, funds expected to be generated from operations and the ABL Facility.
837465_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	declines and incurred significant losses, including negative cash flows from operations in 2012.
837465_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	As discussed above, during 2012, the Company implemented significant changes to its business, including among other things, steps designed to increase product sales as well as initiatives designed to reduce the Company s manufacturing costs and operating expenses.
837465_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	The Company believes these initiatives will increase the Company s cash flows from operations in 2013.
837465_13_ITEM7_P92_S2	Based upon the Company s current cash balances, its estimates of funds expected to be generated from operations in 2013, and current and projected availability under the ABL Facility, the Company believes that it will be able to finance current and planned operating requirements, capital expenditures, contractual obligations and commercial commitments for at least the next 12 months.
837465_13_ITEM7_P92_S3	The Company s ability to generate sufficient positive cash flows from operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including future economic trends and conditions, the success of the Company s 2012 change initiatives (as discussed above in the Executive Summary), demand for the Company s products, foreign currency exchange rates, and other risks and uncertainties applicable to the Company and its business (see Risk Factors contained in Item 1A).
837465_13_ITEM7_P92_S4	While management believes the 2012 Cost Reduction Initiatives will be effective, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to generate sufficient operating cash flows in the future or maintain or grow its existing cash balances.
837465_13_ITEM7_P92_S5	If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows to fund its business due to a further decline in sales or otherwise and is unable to reduce its manufacturing costs and operating expenses to offset such decline, the Company will need to increase its reliance on the ABL Facility for needed liquidity.
837465_13_ITEM7_P92_S6	If the ABL Facility is not then available or sufficient and the Company could not secure alternative financing arrangements, the Company s future operations would be significantly, adversely affected.
837465_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	As of December 31, 2012, a significant portion of the Company s total cash is held in regions outside of the U.S. Outside of settling intercompany balances during the normal course of operations, the Company may repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries.
837465_13_ITEM7_P93_S1	The Company has not, nor does it anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with its domestic debt service requirements.
837465_13_ITEM7_P93_S2	As such, the Company considers the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon.
837465_13_ITEM7_P93_S3	If in the future the Company decides to repatriate such foreign earnings, it would need to accrue and pay incremental U.S. federal and state income tax, reduced by the current amount of available U.S. federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
837465_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	Capital Resources The Company does not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures.
837465_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	At December 31, 2012, the Company had total outstanding commitments on non-cancelable operating leases of approximately $34.0 million related to certain warehouse, distribution and office facilities, vehicles as well as office equipment.
837465_13_ITEM7_P94_S2	Lease terms range from one to six years expiring at various dates through August 2018, with options to renew at varying terms.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes to limit its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Transactions involving these financial instruments are with creditworthy banks, including the bank that is party to the Company s ABL Facility (see Note 4 Financing Arrangements to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The use of these instruments exposes the Company to market and credit risk which may at times be concentrated with certain counterparties, although counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk from its ABL Facility.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions of its international subsidiaries, including certain balance sheet exposures (payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies) (see Note 18 Derivatives and Hedging to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	In addition, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from the translation of the operating results of the Company s international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	As part of its strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts and put and call option contracts ( foreign currency exchange contracts ) to hedge transactions that are denominated primarily in British Pounds, Euros, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and South Korean Won.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	For most currencies, the Company is a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefits from a weaker U.S. dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which the Company transacts significant amounts of business.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Foreign currency exchange contracts are used only to meet the Company s objectives of offsetting gains and losses from foreign currency exchange exposures with gains and losses from the contracts used to hedge them in order to reduce volatility of earnings.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P2_S3	The extent to which the Company s hedging activities mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates varies based upon many factors, including the amount of transactions being hedged.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P2_S4	Foreign currency rates for financial reporting purposes had a negative impact upon the Company s consolidated reported financial results in 2012 compared to 2011 (see Risk Factors contained in Item 1A and Results of Operations contained in Item 7).
837465_13_ITEM7A_P2_S5	The Company does not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for speculative purposes.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P2_S6	Foreign currency exchange contracts generally mature within 12 months from their inception.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P2_S7	The Company does not designate foreign currency exchange contracts as derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P2_S8	As such, changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized in earnings in the period of change.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	At December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the notional amounts of the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts used to hedge the exposures discussed above were approximately $137.1 million, $165.5 million and $314.2 million, respectively.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no outstanding foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for anticipated sales denominated in foreign currencies.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	As part of the Company s risk management procedure, a sensitivity analysis model is used to measure the potential loss in future earnings of market-sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates or foreign currency values.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The sensitivity analysis model quantifies the estimated potential effect of unfavorable movements of 10% in foreign currencies to which the Company was exposed at December 31, 2012 through its foreign currency exchange contracts.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The estimated maximum one-day loss from the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts, calculated using the sensitivity analysis model described above, is $14.8 million at December 31, 2012.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P4_S3	The Company believes that such a hypothetical loss from its foreign currency exchange contracts would be partially offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The sensitivity analysis model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in earnings that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P5_S1	It also does not represent the maximum possible loss that may occur.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The Company is exposed to interest rate risk from its ABL Facility (see Note 4 Financing Arrangements to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_13_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The interest rate applicable to outstanding loans under the ABL Facility fluctuates depending on the Company s trailing 12 month EBITDA (as defined by the ABL Facility) combined with the Company s availability ratio (as defined below).
837465_13_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The interest rate applicable to outstanding loans under the U.S. facility is based on a calculation of either the U.S. Prime Rate or the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate as published by Reuters ( LIBOR ) plus an applicable margin of 1.25% to 2.75%.
837465_13_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The interest rate applicable to outstanding loans under the Canadian facility is based on a calculation of either the Base Rate publicly announced by Bank of America Canada or Canada s Prime Rate plus a margin of 1.25% to 2.75%.

837465_13_ITEM15_P38_S1	The Company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded.
837465_13_ITEM15_P38_S2	In estimating its future warranty obligations, the Company considers various relevant factors, including the Company s stated warranty policies and practices, the historical frequency of claims, and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty.
837465_13_ITEM15_P38_S3	The decrease in the estimated future warranty obligation is primarily due to a decline in sales and in warranty return rates primarily due to improved durability of newer products combined with an increase in customer paid repairs.
837465_13_ITEM15_P38_S4	The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to the Company s reserve for warranty expense:
837465_13_ITEM15_P39_S0	Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability (the exit price) in the principle and most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
837465_13_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Company measures and discloses the fair value of nonfinancial and financial assets and liabilities utilizing a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to a fair value measurement are considered to be observable or unobservable in a marketplace.
837465_13_ITEM15_P39_S2	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions.
837465_13_ITEM15_P39_S3	This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.
837465_13_ITEM15_P39_S4	The measurement of assets and liabilities at fair value are classified using the following three-tier hierarchy:
837465_13_ITEM15_P39_S5	Level 1 : Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 : Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and Level 3 :
837465_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	Fair value measurements derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
837465_13_ITEM15_P40_S1	The Company measures fair value using a set of standardized procedures that are outlined herein for all assets and liabilities which are required to be measured at fair value.
837465_13_ITEM15_P40_S2	When available, the Company utilizes quoted market prices from an independent third party source to determine fair value and classifies such items in Level 1.
837465_13_ITEM15_P40_S3	In some instances where a market price is available, but the instrument is in an inactive or over-the-counter market, the Company consistently applies the dealer (market maker) pricing estimate and uses a midpoint approach on bid and ask prices from financial institutions to determine the reasonableness of these estimates.
837465_13_ITEM15_P40_S4	Assets and liabilities subject to this fair value valuation approach are typically classified as Level 2.
837465_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	Items valued using internally-generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
837465_13_ITEM15_P41_S1	As a result, the asset or liability could be classified in either Level 2 or Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.
837465_13_ITEM15_P42_S0	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow valuation model whenever applicable to derive a fair value measurement on long-lived assets, goodwill and amortizing intangibles.
837465_13_ITEM15_P42_S1	The Company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate.
837465_13_ITEM15_P42_S2	The Company also considers its counterparty s and own credit risk on derivatives and other liabilities measured at their fair value.
837465_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	Advertising Costs The Company advertises primarily through television and print media.
837465_13_ITEM15_P43_S1	The Company s policy is to expense advertising costs, including production costs, as incurred.
837465_13_ITEM15_P43_S2	Advertising expenses for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $65,068,000, $53,051,000 and $48,432,000, respectively.
837465_13_ITEM15_P44_S0	Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
837465_13_ITEM15_P44_S1	Research and development costs for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $29,542,000, $34,309,000 and $36,383,000, respectively.
837465_13_ITEM15_P45_S0	Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions The Company s foreign subsidiaries utilize their local currency as their functional currency.
837465_13_ITEM15_P45_S1	The accounts of these foreign subsidiaries have been translated into United States dollars using the current exchange rate at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and at the average exchange rate for the period for revenues and expenses.
837465_13_ITEM15_P46_S0	Gains or losses resulting from transactions that are made in a currency different from the functional currency are recognized in earnings as they occur.
837465_13_ITEM15_P46_S1	The Company recorded a net loss in foreign currency transactions of $3,343,000 in 2012 and net gains of $708,000 and $6,926,000 in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
837465_13_ITEM15_P47_S0	Derivatives and Hedging The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rates.
837465_13_ITEM15_P47_S1	The derivative instruments are accounted for pursuant to ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, measure those instruments at fair value and recognize changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change unless the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge that offsets certain exposures.
837465_13_ITEM15_P47_S2	As of December 31, 2012, the Company had derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts and put and call option contracts that were not designated as hedging instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815.
837465_13_ITEM15_P48_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less.
837465_13_ITEM15_P48_S1	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments.
837465_13_ITEM15_P48_S2	An estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, the customer s financial condition and current economic trends, all of which are subject to change.
837465_13_ITEM15_P48_S3	Actual uncollected amounts have historically been consistent with the Company s expectations.
837465_13_ITEM15_P48_S4	The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to the Company s allowance for doubtful accounts: Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value.
837465_13_ITEM15_P49_S0	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
837465_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	The inventory balance, which includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs, is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory.
837465_13_ITEM15_P50_S1	The estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon current inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience as well as management s estimates of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand, all of which are subject to change.
837465_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
837465_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows:
837465_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	Normal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
837465_13_ITEM15_P53_S1	Expenditures that materially increase values, change capacities or extend useful lives are capitalized.
837465_13_ITEM15_P53_S2	The related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income/(loss).
837465_13_ITEM15_P54_S0	Construction in-process consists primarily of costs associated with building improvements, machinery and equipment that have not yet been placed into service, unfinished molds as well as in-process internally developed software.
837465_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 350-40, Internal-Use Software, the Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal use software.
837465_13_ITEM15_P55_S1	Costs incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed.
837465_13_ITEM15_P55_S2	All direct external costs incurred to develop internal-use software during the development stage are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful lives.
837465_13_ITEM15_P55_S3	Costs such as maintenance and training are expensed as incurred.
837465_13_ITEM15_P56_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-05, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , the Company assesses potential impairments of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying value may not be recoverable.
837465_13_ITEM15_P56_S1	An impairment charge would be recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.
837465_13_ITEM15_P56_S2	The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group.
837465_13_ITEM15_P57_S0	Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets consist of goodwill, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, patents and other intangible assets acquired during the acquisition of Odyssey Sports, Inc. in 1997, FrogTrader, Inc. in 2004, the Tour Golf Group Inc. assets in 2006, the uPlay, LLC assets in 2008, and certain foreign distributors.
837465_13_ITEM15_P57_S1	In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually or when events indicate that an impairment exists.
837465_13_ITEM15_P57_S2	The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets over their estimated fair value.
837465_13_ITEM15_P57_S3	If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded.
837465_13_ITEM15_P57_S4	To determine fair value, the Company uses its internal discounted cash flow estimates, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals when appropriate.
837465_13_ITEM15_P58_S0	Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-05 discussed above.
837465_13_ITEM15_P58_S1	See Note 8 for further discussion of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets.
837465_13_ITEM15_P59_S0	Investments The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of acquisition and reevaluates such classification at each balance sheet date.
837465_13_ITEM15_P59_S1	Investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are stated at cost and are reported in other assets.
837465_13_ITEM15_P59_S2	The Company monitors investments for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 325-35-2, Impairment and ASC Topic 320-35-17 through 35-35, Scope of Impairment Guidance.
837465_13_ITEM15_P59_S3	See Note 9 for further discussion of the Company s investments.
837465_13_ITEM15_P60_S0	ASC Topic 718 further requires a reduction in share-based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_13_ITEM15_P61_S0	The forfeiture rate used by the Company is based on historical forfeiture trends.
837465_13_ITEM15_P61_S1	If actual forfeiture rates are not consistent with the Company s estimates, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods.
837465_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options and stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) at the date of grant.
837465_13_ITEM15_P62_S1	The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions to calculate the value of stock options/SARs.
837465_13_ITEM15_P62_S2	The Company uses historical data among other information to estimate the expected price volatility, expected term, and forfeiture rate.
837465_13_ITEM15_P62_S3	The Company uses forecasted dividends to estimate the expected dividend yield.
837465_13_ITEM15_P62_S4	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
837465_13_ITEM15_P63_S0	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for stock options.
837465_13_ITEM15_P63_S1	Compensation expense for SARs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an estimated fair value, which is remeasured at the end of each reporting period.
837465_13_ITEM15_P63_S2	Once vested, the SARs continue to be remeasured to fair value until they are exercised.
837465_13_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Company records compensation expense for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (collectively restricted stock ) based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
837465_13_ITEM15_P64_S1	The estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the award date multiplied by the number of shares underlying the restricted stock awarded.
837465_13_ITEM15_P64_S2	Total compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
837465_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	Phantom stock units ( PSUs ) are a form of share-based awards that are indexed to the Company s stock and are settled in cash.
837465_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the award s estimated fair value.
837465_13_ITEM15_P66_S1	Fair value is remeasured at the end of each interim reporting period through the award s settlement date and is based on the closing price of the Company s stock.
837465_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	Income Taxes Current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year.
837465_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to ASC Topic 740 and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
837465_13_ITEM15_P68_S1	The Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
837465_13_ITEM15_P68_S2	In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire.
837465_13_ITEM15_P68_S3	These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment, including estimates of future taxable income.
837465_13_ITEM15_P68_S4	These estimates are based on the Company s best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions.
837465_13_ITEM15_P68_S5	In 2011, as a result of this evaluation, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_13_ITEM15_P68_S6	At the end of each interim and annual reporting period, as the U.S. deferred tax assets are adjusted upwards or downwards, the associated valuation allowance and income tax expense are also adjusted.
837465_13_ITEM15_P68_S7	If sufficient positive evidence arises in the future, such as a sustained return to profitability in the U.S. business, any existing valuation allowance could be reversed as appropriate, decreasing income tax expense in the period that such conclusion is reached.
837465_13_ITEM15_P68_S8	The Company concluded that with respect to non-U.S. entities, there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that the realization of its deferred tax assets is deemed to be likely, and no allowances have been established.
837465_13_ITEM15_P68_S9	For further information, see Note 12 Income Taxes.
837465_13_ITEM15_P68_S10	Pursuant to ASC Topic 740-25-6, the Company is required to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is deemed to be more likely than not that the Company would be required to pay such additional taxes.
837465_13_ITEM15_P69_S0	The Company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions.
837465_13_ITEM15_P69_S1	The preparation of these income tax returns requires the Company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by the Company.
837465_13_ITEM15_P69_S2	The Company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability, including interest and penalties in income tax expense, for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return.
837465_13_ITEM15_P69_S3	The Company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available.
837465_13_ITEM15_P70_S0	Historically, additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the Company s uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the Company s expectations.
837465_13_ITEM15_P70_S1	For further information, see Note 12 Income Taxes.
837465_13_ITEM15_P71_S0	Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net primarily includes gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts and foreign currency transactions.

837465_13_ITEM15_P72_S0	The components of accumulated other comprehensive income include net income and foreign currency translation adjustments.
837465_13_ITEM15_P72_S1	Since the Company has met the indefinite reversal criteria, it does not accrue income taxes on foreign currency translation adjustments.
837465_13_ITEM15_P72_S2	The total equity adjustment from foreign currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income was income of $14,770,000 and $14,071,000 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
837465_13_ITEM15_P73_S0	The Company s operating segments are organized on the basis of products and consist of golf clubs and golf balls.

837465_13_ITEM15_P74_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk The Company s financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, trade receivables and foreign currency exchange contracts.
837465_13_ITEM15_P74_S1	The Company historically invests its excess cash in money market accounts and short-term U.S. government securities and has established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities in an effort to maintain safety and liquidity.
837465_13_ITEM15_P74_S2	These guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of trends in yields and interest rates.
837465_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	The Company operates in the golf equipment industry and primarily sells its products to golf equipment retailers (including pro shops at golf courses and off-course retailers), sporting goods retailers and mass merchants, directly and through wholly-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries, and to foreign distributors.
837465_13_ITEM15_P75_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally requires no collateral from these customers.
837465_13_ITEM15_P75_S2	The Company maintains reserves for estimated credit losses, which it considers adequate to cover any such losses.
837465_13_ITEM15_P75_S3	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, no single customer in the United States represented over 10% of the Company s outstanding accounts receivable balance.
837465_13_ITEM15_P76_S0	Managing customer-related credit risk is more difficult in regions outside of the United States.
837465_13_ITEM15_P76_S1	In 2012 and 2011, approximately 53% of the Company s net sales were made in regions outside of the United States, compared to 52% in 2010.
837465_13_ITEM15_P76_S2	Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions in the United States or in the Company s international markets could significantly increase the Company s credit risk.
837465_13_ITEM15_P77_S0	From time to time, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and put or call options for the purpose of hedging foreign exchange rate exposures on existing or anticipated transactions.
837465_13_ITEM15_P77_S1	In the event of a failure to honor one of these contracts by one of the banks with which the Company has contracted, management believes any loss would be limited to the exchange rate differential from the time the contract was made until the time it was settled.
837465_13_ITEM15_P78_S0	In 2010, the Company began the implementation of its Global Operations Strategy Initiatives ( GOS Initiatives ), which targeted the restructuring and relocation of the Company s manufacturing and distribution operations.
837465_13_ITEM15_P78_S1	This restructuring, which was designed to add speed and flexibility to customer service demands, optimize efficiencies, and facilitate long-term gross margin improvements, included the reorganization of the Company s manufacturing and distribution centers located in Carlsbad, California, Toronto, Canada, and Chicopee, Massachusetts, the creation of third-party logistics sites in Dallas, Texas and Toronto, Canada, as well as the establishment of a new production facility in Monterrey, Mexico.
837465_13_ITEM15_P78_S2	This restructuring was completed in 2011 and only nominal charges were incurred in 2012.
837465_13_ITEM15_P78_S3	The Company continues to maintain limited manufacturing and distribution facilities in Carlsbad, California and Chicopee, Massachusetts.

837465_13_ITEM15_P78_S5	The majority of these charges were recognized within cost of sales.
837465_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	Costs incurred during 2012 were minimal.
837465_13_ITEM15_P79_S1	See Note 19 for charges absorbed by the Company s operating segments.
837465_13_ITEM15_P79_S2	In the aggregate through December 31, 2011, the Company recognized total charges of $39,419,000 in connection with the GOS Initiatives.
837465_13_ITEM15_P79_S3	The charges recognized under the GOS Initiatives include non-cash charges for the acceleration of depreciation on certain golf club and golf ball manufacturing equipment and cash charges related to severance benefits and transition costs, which consist primarily of consulting expenses, costs associated with redundancies during the start-up and training phase of the new production facility in Monterrey, Mexico, start-up costs associated with the establishment of third-party logistics sites, travel expenses, and costs associated with the transfer of inventory and equipment.
837465_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	demand creation initiatives to drive sales growth.
837465_13_ITEM15_P80_S1	The Company s restructuring plan resulted in annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $50,000,000 of which approximately half were reinvested into the Callaway and Odyssey brands and demand creation initiatives.
837465_13_ITEM15_P80_S2	In connection with these initiatives, during 2012 the Company recognized net pre-tax charges of $1,012,000 of which $473,000 and $539,000 were recognized in cost of sales and operating expenses, respectively.
837465_13_ITEM15_P80_S3	In 2011, the Company recognized total pre-tax charges $16,329,000, of which $1,251,000 and $15,078,000 were recognized in cost of sales and operating expenses, respectively.

837465_13_ITEM15_P115_S0	The current year change in net deferred taxes of $1,742,000 is comprised of a net deferred expense of $1,479,000 related to the change in the basis difference of intangible assets with an indefinite life, a net deferred expense of $191,000 related to foreign and separate state jurisdictions for which no valuation allowance has been provided, and a $72,000 expense related to foreign currency translation adjustments.
837465_13_ITEM15_P116_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are anticipated to be in effect at the time the differences are expected to reverse.
837465_13_ITEM15_P116_S1	The realization of the deferred tax assets, including the loss and credit carry forwards listed above, is subject to the Company generating sufficient taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become realizable.
837465_13_ITEM15_P116_S2	In accordance with the applicable accounting rules, the Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
837465_13_ITEM15_P117_S0	evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire.
837465_13_ITEM15_P117_S1	These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment, including estimates of future taxable income.
837465_13_ITEM15_P117_S2	These estimates are based on the Company s best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions.
837465_13_ITEM15_P118_S0	In 2011, the Company performed an analysis to determine the likelihood that its deferred tax assets relating to its U.S. business would be realized.
837465_13_ITEM15_P118_S1	The Company considered its taxable loss in the U.S. in each of the past three years, the reasons for such loss, the Company s projected financial forecast for its U.S business, and the dates on which the deferred tax assets were expected to expire.
837465_13_ITEM15_P118_S2	This evidence suggested that the Company should establish a valuation allowance.
837465_13_ITEM15_P118_S3	As a result, in 2011, the Company recorded a $52,455,000 increase to income tax expense in order to establish a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets and discontinued recognizing income tax benefits related to its U.S. net operating losses.
837465_13_ITEM15_P118_S4	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the valuation allowance against the Company s U.S. deferred tax assets was $151,097,000 and $110,844,000, respectively.
837465_13_ITEM15_P118_S5	If sufficient positive evidence arises in the future, such as a sustained return to profitability, any existing valuation allowance could be reversed as appropriate, decreasing income tax expense in the period that such conclusion is reached.
837465_13_ITEM15_P118_S6	The Company has concluded that with respect to non-U.S. entities, there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that realization of its deferred tax assets is more likely than not under applicable accounting rules, and no allowances have been established.
837465_13_ITEM15_P118_S7	The non-cash charge to establish the valuation allowance in 2011 did not have any impact on the Company s consolidated cash flows, nor will such an allowance preclude the Company from using loss carry forwards or other deferred tax assets in the future, except as described below.
837465_13_ITEM15_P118_S8	Until the Company re-establishes a pattern of continuing profitability, in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, U.S. income tax expense or benefit related to the recognition of deferred tax assets in the consolidated statement of operations for future periods will be offset by decreases or increases in the valuation allowance with no net effect on the consolidated statement of operations.
837465_13_ITEM15_P118_S9	At December 31, 2012, the Company has federal and state income tax credit carryforwards of $4,354,000 and $6,985,000 respectively, which will expire at various dates beginning in 2020.
837465_13_ITEM15_P118_S10	Such credit carryforwards (in thousands) expire as follows: The Company has recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the benefit of operating loss carryforwards.
837465_13_ITEM15_P118_S11	The net operating losses (in thousands) expire as follows: The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted on January 2, 2013.
837465_13_ITEM15_P118_S12	Included within this legislation was an extension of the research and development credit which had previously expired on December 31, 2011.
837465_13_ITEM15_P118_S13	This legislation retroactively reinstates and extends the credit from the previous expiration date through December 31, 2013.
837465_13_ITEM15_P118_S14	As the legislation was not enacted until after the close of the year ended December 31, 2012, the income tax impact of the retroactive reinstatement and extension will not be recognized until 2013.
837465_13_ITEM15_P118_S15	If the tax impact of the research and development credit was recognized, the Company does not anticipate any federal income tax benefit due to the valuation allowance against the Company s U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_13_ITEM15_P118_S16	Although the Company has set up a valuation allowance against the majority of its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carry forwards and other losses, such allowance does not preclude the Company from using the deferred tax assets in the future.
837465_13_ITEM15_P119_S0	to utilize the losses to offset future taxable income may be deferred or limited significantly if the Company were to experience an ownership change as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
837465_13_ITEM15_P120_S0	In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in ownership of the Company s stock by 5-percent shareholders (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
837465_13_ITEM15_P120_S1	The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred for purposes of Section 382 is complex and requires significant judgment.
837465_13_ITEM15_P120_S2	The extent to which the Company s ability to utilize the losses is limited as a result of such an ownership change depends on many variables, including the value of the Company s stock at the time of the ownership change.
837465_13_ITEM15_P120_S3	Although the Company s ownership has changed during the three-year period ended December 31, 2012, the Company does not believe there has been a cumulative increase in ownership in excess of 50 percentage points during that period.
837465_13_ITEM15_P120_S4	The Company continues to monitor changes in ownership.
837465_13_ITEM15_P120_S5	If such a cumulative increase did occur in any three year period and the Company was limited in the amount of losses it could use to offset taxable income, the Company s results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted.
837465_13_ITEM15_P121_S0	A reconciliation of the effective tax rate on income or loss and the statutory tax rate is as follows:
837465_13_ITEM15_P122_S0	In 2012, 2011 and 2010, the tax rate was impacted by favorable adjustments to previously estimated tax liabilities in the amount of $142,000, $2,000, and $515,000, respectively.
837465_13_ITEM15_P122_S1	The most significant adjustments in each year related to adjustments resulting from the finalization of the Company s prior year U.S. and state income tax returns as well as agreements reached with the Internal Revenue Service and other major jurisdictions on certain issues necessitating a reassessment of the Company s tax exposures for all open tax years, with no individual year being significantly affected.
837465_13_ITEM15_P122_S2	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):
837465_13_ITEM15_P123_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax benefits was $7,064,000 and can be reduced by $3,148,000 of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, which was recorded as a long-term income tax receivable, as well as $748,000 of tax benefits associated with state income taxes and other timing adjustments, which are recorded as deferred income taxes pursuant to ASC Topic 740-25-6.
837465_13_ITEM15_P123_S1	The net amount of $3,168,000, if recognized, would affect the Company s financial statements and favorably affect the Company s effective income tax rate.
837465_13_ITEM15_P123_S2	The Company does expect changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months; however, the Company does not expect the changes to have a material impact on its results of operations or its financial position.
837465_13_ITEM15_P124_S0	The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
837465_13_ITEM15_P124_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized tax expense of approximately $44,000 and $242,000, and a net benefit of approximately $490,000, respectively, related to interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes.
837465_13_ITEM15_P124_S2	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the gross amount of accrued interest and penalties included in income taxes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was $934,000 and $890,000, respectively.

837465_13_ITEM15_P125_S1	The Company is generally no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities in its major jurisdictions as follows: As of December 31, 2012, the Company did not provide for United States income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on a cumulative total of $105,383,000 of undistributed earnings from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that will be permanently reinvested outside the United States.
837465_13_ITEM15_P125_S2	Upon remittance, certain foreign countries impose withholding taxes that are then available, subject to certain limitations, for use as credits against the Company s U.S. tax liability, if any.
837465_13_ITEM15_P125_S3	If the foreign earnings were remitted, the Company does not anticipate any federal or state income taxes due to the valuation allowance against the Company s U.S. deferred tax assets offset.
837465_13_ITEM15_P125_S4	The Company estimates that it would have withholding taxes of less than $1,000,000 upon remittance.
837465_13_ITEM15_P126_S0	Commitments and Contingencies Legal Matters The Company is subject to routine legal claims, proceedings, and investigations incident to its business activities, including claims, proceedings, and investigations relating to commercial disputes and employment matters.
837465_13_ITEM15_P126_S1	The Company also receives from time to time information claiming that products sold by the Company infringe or may infringe patent, trademark, or other intellectual property rights of third parties.
837465_13_ITEM15_P126_S2	One or more such claims of potential infringement could lead to litigation, the need to obtain licenses, the need to alter a product to avoid infringement, a settlement or judgment, or some other action or material loss by the Company, which also could adversely affect the Company s overall ability to protect its product designs and ultimately limit its future success in the marketplace.
837465_13_ITEM15_P126_S3	In addition, the Company is occasionally subject to non-routine claims, proceedings, or investigations.
837465_13_ITEM15_P127_S0	The Company regularly assesses such matters to determine the degree of probability that the Company will incur a material loss as a result of such matters as well as the range of possible loss.
837465_13_ITEM15_P128_S0	An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the Company s financial statements if it is probable the Company will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
837465_13_ITEM15_P129_S0	The Company reviews all claims, proceedings, and investigations at least quarterly and establishes or adjusts any accruals for such matters to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.
837465_13_ITEM15_P129_S1	All legal costs associated with such matters are expensed as incurred.
837465_13_ITEM15_P130_S0	Historically, the claims, proceedings and investigations brought against the Company, individually, and in the aggregate, have not had a material adverse effect upon the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial position of the Company.
837465_13_ITEM15_P130_S1	The Company believes that it has valid legal defenses to the matters currently pending against the Company.
837465_13_ITEM15_P130_S2	These matters are inherently unpredictable and the resolutions of these matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcomes are not predictable with assurance.
837465_13_ITEM15_P130_S3	Consequently, management is unable to estimate the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary loss, amounts covered by insurance, or the financial impact that will result from such matters.
837465_13_ITEM15_P130_S4	Management believes that the final resolution of the current matters pending against the Company, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company s consolidated financial position.
837465_13_ITEM15_P130_S5	It is possible, however, that the Company s results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these contingencies.

837465_13_ITEM15_P135_S5	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be obligated to make.
837465_13_ITEM15_P136_S0	Historically, costs incurred to settle claims related to indemnities have not been material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_13_ITEM15_P136_S1	In addition, the Company believes the likelihood is remote that material payments under the commitments and guarantees described above will have a material effect on the Company s financial condition.
837465_13_ITEM15_P136_S2	The fair value of indemnities, commitments and guarantees that the Company issued during the year ended December 31, 2012 was not material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

837465_13_ITEM15_P149_S3	The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
837465_13_ITEM15_P149_S4	The model uses various assumptions, including a risk-free interest rate, the expected term of the options, the expected stock price volatility, and the expected dividend yield.
837465_13_ITEM15_P150_S0	Compensation expense for employee stock options is recognized over the vesting term and is reduced by an estimate for forfeitures, which is based on the Company s historical forfeitures of unvested options and awards.

837465_13_ITEM15_P152_S2	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected term of the options at the date of the grant.
837465_13_ITEM15_P152_S3	The expected life of the Company s options is based on evaluations of historical employee exercise behavior, forfeitures, cancellations and other factors.
837465_13_ITEM15_P152_S4	The valuation model applied in this calculation utilizes highly subjective assumptions that could potentially change over time.
837465_13_ITEM15_P152_S5	Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option.
837465_13_ITEM15_P152_S6	Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by the employee holding the option.

837465_14_ITEM1_P13_S2	At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , most of the Company s golf club production volume was made in regions outside of the United States.
837465_14_ITEM1_P13_S3	Overall, the golf club assembly process is fairly labor intensive and requires extensive global supply chain coordination and utilizes raw materials that are obtained from suppliers both internationally and within the United States.
837465_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	In February 2013, the Company sold the building housing its golf ball manufacturing operations in Chicopee, Massachusetts and entered into an agreement to lease back a reduced portion of the square footage to better align with current manufacturing volumes.

837465_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Sales of the Company s products in the United States are made and supported by full-time regional field representatives and in-house sales and customer service representatives.
837465_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	Most regions in the United States are covered by both a field representative and a dedicated in-house sales representative who work together to initiate and maintain relationships with customers through frequent telephone calls and in-person visits.

837465_14_ITEM1_P20_S3	In addition, other dedicated sales representatives provide service to corporate customers who want their corporate logo imprinted on the Company s golf balls, putters or golf bags.

837465_14_ITEM1_P20_S7	A portion of the Company s custom club sales are generated from the utilization of club fitting programs such as performance centers, which utilize high speed cameras and precision software to capture relevant swing data.
837465_14_ITEM1_P20_S8	All performance centers and participating on-and-off course retail stores are equipped with custom fitting systems that incorporate the use of an extensive variety of clubhead and shaft combinations in order to find a set of golf clubs that fits a golfer s personal specifications.
837465_14_ITEM1_P20_S9	The Company believes that offering golfers the opportunity to increase performance with custom club specifications increases sales and promotes brand loyalty.
837465_14_ITEM1_P20_S10	The Company maintains various sales programs including a Preferred Retailer Program.
837465_14_ITEM1_P20_S11	The Preferred Retailer Program offers longer payment terms during the initial sell-in period, as well as potential rebates and discounts for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the Company, including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels, prime product placement and retailer staff training.
837465_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	Sales Outside of the United States Of the Company s total net sales, approximately 52% was derived from sales for distribution outside of the United States in 2013, and approximately 53% in both 2012 and 2011.

837465_14_ITEM1_P22_S3	Prices of golf clubs and balls for sales by distributors outside of the United States generally reflect an export pricing discount to compensate international distributors for selling and distribution costs.
837465_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	A change in the Company s relationship with significant distributors could negatively impact the volume of the Company s international sales.
837465_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Company s sales programs in foreign countries are specifically designed based upon local laws and competitive conditions.
837465_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	Some of the sales programs utilized include the custom club fitting experiences and the Preferred Retailer Program or variations of those programs employed in the United States as described above.
837465_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	Conducting business outside of the United States subjects the Company to increased risks inherent in international business.
837465_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	These risks include but are not limited to foreign currency risks, increased difficulty in protecting the Company s intellectual property rights and trade secrets, unexpected government action or changes in legal or regulatory requirements, and social, economic or political instability.

837465_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	In most of the regions where the Company does business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis.
837465_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	Weather conditions in most parts of the world generally restrict golf from being played year-round, with many of the Company s on-course customers closing during the cold weather months.
837465_14_ITEM1_P31_S2	The Company s business is therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_14_ITEM1_P31_S3	In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season.
837465_14_ITEM1_P31_S4	This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter.
837465_14_ITEM1_P31_S5	The Company s second quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter.
837465_14_ITEM1_P31_S6	The Company s third quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but are generally less than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season.
837465_14_ITEM1_P31_S7	The Company s fourth quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company s key markets.
837465_14_ITEM1_P31_S8	However, third quarter sales can be affected by a mid-year launch of product, and fourth quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year.
837465_14_ITEM1_P31_S9	This seasonality, and therefore quarter to quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as well as weather conditions.
837465_14_ITEM1_P31_S10	In general, however, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company s sales and most, if not all, of its profitability generally occurs during the first half of the year.
837465_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	The Company s operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of certain materials, substances and wastes and the remediation of environmental contaminants ( Environmental Laws ).
837465_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	In the ordinary course of its manufacturing processes, the Company uses paints, chemical solvents and other materials, and generates waste by-products that are subject to these Environmental Laws.
837465_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	In addition, in connection with the Top-Flite asset acquisition in 2003, the Company assumed certain monitoring and remediation obligations at its manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts.
837465_14_ITEM1_P32_S3	In February 2013, the Company sold this facility and, as part of the terms of sale, the Company assumed certain ongoing environmental remediation obligations.
837465_14_ITEM1_P32_S4	The Company adheres to all applicable Environmental Laws and takes action as necessary to comply with these laws.
837465_14_ITEM1_P32_S5	The Company maintains an environmental and safety program and employs full-time environmental, health and safety professionals at its facilities located in Carlsbad, California, Chicopee, Massachusetts and Monterrey, Mexico.
837465_14_ITEM1_P32_S6	The environmental and safety program includes obtaining environmental permits as required, capturing and appropriately disposing of any waste by-products, tracking hazardous waste generation and disposal, air emissions, safety situations, material safety data sheet management, storm water management and recycling, and auditing and reporting on its compliance.
837465_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	Historically, the costs of environmental compliance have not had a material adverse effect upon the Company s business.
837465_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	The Company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws.
837465_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	Sustainability The Company believes it is important to conduct its business in an environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable manner.
837465_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	In this regard, the Company has an environmental sustainability program which focuses on the reductions of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, reductions of hazardous waste, reductions in water usage, improved recycling and development programs which involve the elimination or reduction of undesirable chemicals and solvents in favor of safer and environmentally preferred alternatives.
837465_14_ITEM1_P34_S2	These efforts cross divisional lines and are visible in the following areas within the Company:
837465_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	Supply chain management through Social, Safety, and Environmental Responsibility audits of suppliers.
837465_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	The Company also has two existing programs focusing on the community, the Callaway Golf Company Foundation and the Callaway Golf Company Employee Community Giving program.
837465_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	Through these programs the Company and its employees are able to give back to the community through monetary donations and by providing community services.
837465_14_ITEM1_P35_S3	Information on both of these programs is available on the Company s website at www.callawaygolf.com.
837465_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	By being active and visible in the community and by embracing the principles of environmental stewardship, the Company believes it is acting in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.

837465_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The Company s business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We urge you to carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those risks set forth under the heading entitled Important Notice to Investors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, and in other documents that the Company files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, before making any investment decision with respect to the Company s securities.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop, the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Under these circumstances, the trading prices of the Company s securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in the Company s securities.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Unfavorable economic conditions could have a negative impact on consumer discretionary spending and therefore negatively impact the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The Company sells golf clubs, golf balls and golf accessories.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These products are recreational in nature and are therefore discretionary purchases for consumers.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases of golf products during favorable economic conditions and when consumers are feeling confident and prosperous.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Discretionary spending is also affected by many other factors, including general business conditions, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxes, and consumer confidence in future economic conditions.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Purchases of the Company s products could decline during periods when disposable income is lower, or during periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P1_S5	A significant or prolonged decline in general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that adversely affect consumer discretionary spending, whether in the United States or in the Company s international markets, could result in reduced sales of the Company s products, which could have a negative impact on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P1_S6	A severe or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our customers financial condition, their levels of business activity and their ability to pay trade obligations.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The Company primarily sells its products to golf equipment retailers directly and through wholly-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries, and to foreign distributors.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally requires no collateral from these customers.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	However, a severe or prolonged downturn in the general economy could adversely affect the retail golf equipment market which in turn, would negatively impact the liquidity and cash flows of our customers, including the ability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and to pay their trade obligations.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	This could result in increased delinquent or uncollectible accounts for some of the Company s significant customers.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P2_S4	A failure by the Company s customers to pay on a timely basis a significant portion of outstanding account receivable balances would adversely impact the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P2_S5	The Company has significant international sales and purchases, and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the Company s results of operations.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	A significant portion of the Company s purchases and sales is international, and the Company conducts transactions in approximately 19 currencies worldwide.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Conducting business in such various currencies exposes the Company to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In addition, the Company s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	As a result, transactions conducted in foreign currencies must be translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes based upon the applicable foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Fluctuations in these foreign currency exchange rates therefore may positively or negatively affect the Company s reported financial results and can significantly affect period-over-period comparisons.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The effect of the translation of foreign currencies on the Company s financial results can be significant.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The Company therefore engages in certain hedging activities to mitigate over time the impact of the translation of foreign currencies on the Company s financial results.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The Company s hedging activities can reduce, but will not eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	upon many factors, including the amount of transactions being hedged.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Other factors that could affect the effectiveness of the Company s hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts, volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Since the hedging activities are designed to reduce volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar but also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Company s future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts business.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Foreign currency fluctuations can also affect the prices at which products are sold in the Company s international markets.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The Company therefore adjusts its pricing based in part upon fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Significant unanticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates make it more difficult for the Company to manage pricing in its international markets.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P6_S4	If the Company is unable to adjust its pricing in a timely manner to counteract the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, the Company s pricing may not be competitive in the marketplace and the Company s financial results in its international markets could be adversely affected.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P6_S5	The Company s obligations and certain financial covenants contained under its existing credit facility expose it to risks that could materially and adversely affect its liquidity, business, operating results, financial condition and ability to make any dividend or other payments on its capital stock.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The Company s primary credit facility is a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (as amended, the ABL Facility ), comprised of a U.S. facility, a Canadian facility and a United Kingdom facility, in each case subject to borrowing base availability under the applicable facility.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are secured by certain assets, including cash (to the extent pledged by the Company), inventory and accounts receivable, of the Company s U.S., Canadian and U.K. legal entities.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	The Company s borrowing is limited by the availability ratio, which is expressed as a percentage, of (a) the average daily availability under the ABL Facility to (b) the sum of the Canadian, the U.K. and the U.S. borrowing bases, as adjusted.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	All applicable margins can be permanently reduced by 0.25% if EBITDA, as defined in the ABL Facility, meets or exceeds $25.0 million over any trailing twelve-month period, and can be permanently reduced by an additional 0.25% if EBITDA meets or exceeds $50.0 million over any trailing twelve-month period.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The ABL Facility includes certain restrictions including, among other things, restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, liens, dividends and other restricted payments, asset sales, investments, mergers, acquisitions and affiliate transactions.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Additionally, the Company is subject to compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant during, and continuing 30 days after, any period in which the Company s borrowing base availability falls below $25.0 million.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If the Company experiences a decline in revenues or adjusted EBITDA, the Company may have difficulty paying interest and principal amounts due on its ABL Facility or other indebtedness and meeting certain of the financial covenants contained in the ABL Facility.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If the Company is unable to make required payments under the ABL Facility, or if the Company fails to comply with the various covenants and other requirements of the ABL Facility or other indebtedness, the Company would be in default thereunder, which would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate the maturity thereof.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Any default under the ABL Facility or other indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s liquidity, business, operating results and financial condition and ability to make any dividend or other payments on the Company s capital stock.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P8_S5	See Note 4 Financing Arrangements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the terms of the ABL Facility.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	In addition to cash on hand as well as cash generated from operations, the Company relies on its ABL Facility to manage seasonal fluctuations in liquidity and to provide additional liquidity when the Company s operating cash flows are not sufficient to fund the Company s requirements.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The Company experienced negative cash flows from operations in 2009-2013.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Although the Company's negative cash flows improved significantly in 2013, the Company will need to grow its sales or reduce its costs in order to generate positive cash flows in 2014.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The Company s ability to generate sufficient positive cash flows from operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including future economic trends and conditions, demand for the Company s products, foreign currency exchange rates, and other risks and uncertainties applicable to the Company and its business.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows to fund its business, the Company will need to increase its reliance on the ABL Facility for needed liquidity.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P9_S5	If the ABL Facility is not available or sufficient and the Company could not secure alternative financing arrangements, the Company s future operations would be significantly, adversely affected.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	If the Company is unable to successfully manage the frequent introduction of new products that satisfy changing consumer preferences, it could significantly and adversely impact its financial performance and prospects for future growth.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The Company s main products, like those of its competitors, generally have life cycles of two years or less, with sales occurring at a much higher rate in the first year than in the second.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Factors driving these short product life cycles include the rapid introduction of competitive products and quickly changing consumer preferences.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In this marketplace, a substantial portion of the Company s annual revenues is generated each year by products that are in their first year of their product life cycle.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	These marketplace conditions raise a number of issues that the Company must successfully manage.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	For example, the Company must properly anticipate consumer preferences and design products that meet those preferences while also complying with significant restrictions imposed by the Rules of Golf (see further discussion of the Rules of Golf below) or its new products will not achieve sufficient market success to compensate for the usual decline in sales experienced by products already in the market.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Second, the Company s research and development and supply chain groups face constant pressures to design, develop, source and supply new products that perform better than their predecessors many of which incorporate new or otherwise untested technology, suppliers or inputs.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Third, for new products to generate equivalent or greater revenues than their predecessors, they must either maintain the same or higher sales levels with the same or higher pricing, or exceed the performance of their predecessors in one or both of those areas.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Fourth, the relatively short window of opportunity for launching and selling new products requires great precision in forecasting demand and assuring that supplies are ready and delivered during the critical selling periods.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Finally, the rapid changeover in products creates a need to monitor and manage the closeout of older products both at retail and in the Company s own inventory.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P12_S7	Should the Company not successfully manage the frequent introduction of new products that satisfy changing consumer preferences, the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be significantly adversely affected.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P12_S8	A reduction in the number of rounds of golf played or in the number of golf participants could adversely affect the Company s sales.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The Company generates substantially all of its revenues from the sale of golf-related products, including golf clubs, golf balls and golf accessories.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The demand for golf-related products in general, and golf balls in particular, is directly related to the number of golf participants and the number of rounds of golf being played by these participants.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If golf participation or the number of rounds of golf played decreases, sales of the Company s products may be adversely affected.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	In the future, the overall dollar volume of the market for golf-related products may not grow or may decline.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P13_S4	In addition, the demand for golf products is also directly related to the popularity of magazines, cable channels and other media dedicated to golf, television coverage of golf tournaments and attendance at golf events.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P13_S5	The Company depends on the exposure of its products through advertising and the media or at golf tournaments and events.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Any significant reduction in television coverage of, or attendance at, golf tournaments and events or any significant reduction in the popularity of golf magazines or golf television channels, could reduce the visibility of the Company s brand and could adversely affect the Company s sales.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P13_S7	The Company may have limited opportunities for future growth in sales of golf clubs and golf balls.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P13_S8	In order for the Company to significantly grow its sales of golf clubs or golf balls, the Company must either increase its share of the market for golf clubs or balls, or the market for golf clubs or balls must grow.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P13_S9	The Company already has a significant share of worldwide sales of golf clubs and golf balls and the golf industry is very competitive.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P13_S10	As such, gaining incremental market share quickly or at all is difficult.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P13_S11	Therefore, opportunities for additional market share may be limited given the challenging competitive nature of the golf industry.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P13_S12	The Company also believes that the worldwide golf market has not grown significantly in recent years.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P13_S13	In the future, the overall dollar volume of worldwide sales of golf clubs or golf balls may not grow or may decline.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P13_S14	If the Company inaccurately forecasts demand for its products, it may manufacture either insufficient or excess quantities, which, in either case, could adversely affect its financial performance.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P13_S15	The Company plans its manufacturing capacity based upon the forecasted demand for its products.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P13_S16	The nature of the Company s business makes it difficult to adjust quickly its manufacturing capacity if actual demand for its products exceeds or is less than forecasted demand.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P13_S17	If actual demand for its products exceeds the forecasted demand, the Company may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of new products in time to fulfill actual demand, which could limit the Company s sales and adversely affect its financial performance.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	could produce excess quantities, resulting in excess inventories and related obsolescence charges that could adversely affect the Company s financial performance.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The Company depends on single source or a limited number of suppliers for some of its products, and the loss of any of these suppliers could harm its business.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Company is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for its clubheads and shafts, some of which are single sourced.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Furthermore, some of the Company s products require specially developed manufacturing techniques and processes which make it difficult to identify and utilize alternative suppliers quickly.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In addition, many of the Company s suppliers are not well capitalized and prolonged unfavorable economic conditions could increase the risk that they will go out of business.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If current suppliers are unable to deliver clubheads, shafts or other components, or if the Company is required to transition to other suppliers, the Company could experience significant production delays or disruption to its business.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	The Company also depends on a single or a limited number of suppliers for the materials it uses to make its golf balls.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Many of these materials are customized for the Company.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Any delay or interruption in such supplies could have a material adverse impact upon the Company s golf ball business.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P15_S7	If the Company did experience any such delays or interruptions, the Company may not be able to find adequate alternative suppliers at a reasonable cost or without significant disruption to its business.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P15_S8	A significant disruption in the operations of the Company s golf club assembly and golf ball manufacturing and assembly facilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company s sales, profitability and results of operations.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	A significant disruption at any of the Company s golf club or golf ball manufacturing facilities or distribution centers in the U.S. and in regions outside the U.S. could materially and adversely affect the Company s sales, profitability and results of operations.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	New regulations related to conflict minerals will require the Company to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing the Company s products.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	On August 22, 2012, the Commission adopted rules requiring disclosure related to sourcing of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The new rules, which are effective for calendar 2013 and require a report to be filed by May 31, 2014, require companies to, under specified circumstances, undertake due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The Company s products may contain some of the specified minerals.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	As a result, the Company may incur additional expenses in connection with complying with the new rules, including with respect to any due diligence that is required under the new rules.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In addition, the implementation of the new rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company s products.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P17_S5	There may only be a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free conflict minerals, and the Company cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain necessary conflict free conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Because the Company s supply chain is complex, the Company may also not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in the Company s products through the due diligence procedures that the Company implements, which may harm the Company s reputation.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P17_S7	A disruption in the service or a significant increase in the cost of the Company s primary delivery and shipping services for its products and component parts could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The Company uses United Parcel Service ( UPS ) for substantially all ground shipments of products to its U.S. customers.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The Company uses air carriers and ocean shipping services for most of its international shipments of products.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Furthermore, many of the components the Company uses to build its golf clubs, including clubheads and shafts, are shipped to the Company via air carrier and ship services.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	If there is any significant interruption in service by such providers or at airports or shipping ports, the Company may be unable to engage alternative suppliers or to receive or ship goods through alternate sites in order to deliver its products or components in a timely and cost-efficient manner.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P18_S4	As a result, the Company could experience manufacturing delays, increased manufacturing and shipping costs, and lost sales as a result of missed delivery deadlines and product demand cycles.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Any significant interruption in UPS services, air carrier services or ship services could have a material adverse effect upon the Company s business.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Furthermore, if the cost of delivery or shipping services were to increase significantly and the additional costs could not be covered by product pricing, the Company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The Company faces intense competition in each of its markets and if it is unable to maintain a competitive advantage, loss of market share, revenue, or profitability may result.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The golf club business is highly competitive, and is served by a number of well-established and well-financed companies with recognized brand names.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	New product introductions, price reductions, consignment sales, extended payment terms, closeouts, including closeouts of products that were recently commercially successful, and significant tour and advertising spending by competitors continue to generate intense market competition.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Furthermore, continued downward pressure on pricing in the market for new clubs could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s pre-owned club business as the gap narrows between the cost of a new club and a pre-owned club.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Successful marketing activities, discounted pricing, consignment sales, extended payment terms or new product introductions by competitors could negatively impact the Company s future sales.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The golf ball business is also highly competitive.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	There are a number of well-established and well-financed competitors, including one competitor with an estimated U.S. market share of over 50%.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	The Company s competitors continue to incur significant costs in the areas of advertising, tour and other promotional support.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The Company believes that to be competitive, the Company also need to continue to incur significant expenses in tour, advertising and promotional support.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Unless there is a change in competitive conditions, these competitive pressures and increased costs will continue to adversely affect the profitability of the Company s golf ball business.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Company s accessories include golf bags, golf gloves, golf footwear, golf apparel and other items.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The Company faces significant competition in every region with respect to each of these product categories.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In most cases, the Company is not the market leader with respect to its accessory markets.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	The Company s golf club and golf ball business has a concentrated customer base.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	The loss of one or more of the Company s top customers could have a significant effect on the Company s golf club and golf ball sales.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P22_S5	On a consolidated basis, no one customer that distributes golf clubs or golf balls in the United States accounted for more than 7% of the Company s consolidated revenues in both 2013 and 2012, and 6% in 2011.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P22_S6	The Company's top five customers accounted for more than 17% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2013, and 14% in both 2012 and 2011.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P22_S7	On a segment basis, in 2013, the top five golf club and golf ball customers accounted for approximately 17% and 27% of the Company s total consolidated golf club and golf ball sales, respectively.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P22_S8	A loss of one or more of these customers could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s golf club and golf ball sales.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P22_S9	International political instability and terrorist activities may decrease demand for the Company s products and disrupt its business.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P22_S10	Terrorist activities and armed conflicts could have an adverse effect upon the United States or worldwide economy and could cause decreased demand for the Company s products as consumers attention and interest are diverted from golf and become focused on issues relating to these events.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P22_S11	If such events disrupt domestic or international air, ground or sea shipments, or the operation of the Company s manufacturing facilities, the Company s ability to obtain the materials necessary to manufacture its products and to deliver customer orders would be harmed, which would have a significant adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P22_S12	Such events can negatively impact tourism, which could adversely affect the Company s sales to retailers at resorts and other vacation destinations.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P22_S13	In addition, the occurrence of political instability and/or terrorist activities generally restricts travel to and from the affected areas, making it more difficult in general to manage the company s international operations.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The Company s business could be harmed by the occurrence of natural disasters or pandemic diseases.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, tsunami, fire, flood or hurricane, or the outbreak of a pandemic disease, could significantly adversely affect the Company s business.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	A natural disaster or a pandemic disease could significantly adversely affect both the demand for the Company s products as well as the supply of the components used to make the Company s products.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Demand for golf products also could be negatively affected as consumers in the affected regions restrict their recreational activities and as tourism to those areas declines.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	If the Company s suppliers experienced a significant disruption in their business as a result of a natural disaster or pandemic disease, the Company s ability to obtain the necessary components to make its products could be significantly adversely affected.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	generally restricts the travel to and from the affected areas, making it more difficult in general to manage the Company s international operations.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The Company s business and operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could result in fluctuations in its operating results and stock price.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The Company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The Company s first quarter sales generally represent the Company s sell-in to the golf retail channel of its golf club products for the new golf season.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The Company s second and third quarter sales generally represent reorder business for golf clubs.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Sales of golf clubs during the second and third quarters are significantly affected not only by the sell-through of the Company s products that were sold into the channel during the first quarter but also by the sell-through of products by the Company s competitors.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Retailers are sometimes reluctant to reorder the Company s products in significant quantities when they already have excess inventory of products of the Company or its competitors.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The Company s sales of golf balls are generally associated with the level of rounds played in the areas where the Company s products are sold.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Therefore, golf ball sales tend to be greater in the second and third quarters, when the weather is good in most of the Company s key markets and rounds played are up.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Golf ball sales are also stimulated by product introductions as the retail channel takes on initial supplies.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Like those of golf clubs, reorders of golf balls depend on the rate of sell-through.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The Company s sales during the fourth quarter are generally significantly less than those of the other quarters because in many of the Company s key regions fewer people are playing golf during that time of year due to cold weather.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Furthermore, the Company generally announces its new product line in the fourth quarter to allow retailers to plan for the new golf season.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Such early announcements of new products could cause golfers, and therefore the Company s customers, to defer purchasing additional golf equipment until the Company s new products are available.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Such deferments could have a material adverse effect upon sales of the Company s current products or result in closeout sales at reduced prices.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P27_S5	The seasonality of the Company s business could be exacerbated by the adverse effects of unusual or severe weather conditions as well as by severe weather conditions caused by climate change on the Company s business.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Due to the seasonality of the Company s business, the Company s business can be significantly adversely affected by unusual or severe weather conditions and by severe weather conditions caused by climate change.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Unfavorable weather conditions generally result in fewer golf rounds played, which generally results in reduced demand for all golf products, and in particular, golf balls.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Furthermore, catastrophic storms can negatively affect golf rounds played both during the storms and afterward, as storm damaged golf courses are repaired and golfers focus on repairing the damage to their homes, businesses and communities.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Consequently, sustained adverse weather conditions, especially during the warm weather months, could materially affect the Company s sales.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of the Company s total assets and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations and shareholders equity.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The Company s goodwill and intangible assets consist of goodwill from acquisitions, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, patents, and other intangible assets.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Accounting rules require the evaluation of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Such indicators include a sustained decline in the Company s stock price or market capitalization, adverse changes in economic or market conditions or prospects, and changes in the Company s operations.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	An asset is considered to be impaired when its carrying value exceeds its fair value.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The Company determines the fair value of an asset based upon the discounted cash flows expected to be realized from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	If in conducting an impairment evaluation the Company determines that the carrying value of an asset exceeded its fair value, the Company would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If a significant amount of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets were deemed to be impaired, the Company s results of operations and shareholders equity would be significantly adversely affected.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The Company s ability to utilize all or a portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets may be limited significantly if the Company experiences an ownership change.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The Company has a significant amount of U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards and other losses.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	The Company s ability to utilize the losses to offset future taxable income may be limited significantly if the Company were to experience an ownership change as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
837465_14_ITEM1A_P32_S3	In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in ownership of the Company s stock by 5-percent shareholders (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P32_S4	The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred for purposes of Section 382 is complex and requires significant judgment.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P32_S5	The extent to which the Company s ability to utilize the losses is limited as a result of such an ownership change depends on many variables, including the value of the Company s stock at the time of the ownership change.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P32_S6	The Company continues to monitor changes in ownership.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P32_S7	If such a cumulative increase did occur in any three year period and the Company were limited in the amount of losses it could use to offset taxable income, the Company s results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P32_S8	Changes in equipment standards under applicable Rules of Golf could adversely affect the Company s business.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P32_S9	The Company seeks to have its new golf club and golf ball products satisfy the standards published by the USGA and The R A in the Rules of Golf because these standards are generally followed by golfers, both professional and amateur, within their respective jurisdictions.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P32_S10	The USGA publishes rules that are generally followed in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and The R A publishes rules that are generally followed in most other countries throughout the world.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P32_S11	However, the Rules of Golf as published by The R A and the USGA are virtually the same, and are intended to be so pursuant to a Joint Statement of Principles issued in 2001.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	In the future, existing USGA and/or R A standards may be altered in ways that adversely affect the sales of the Company s current or future products.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	If a change in rules were adopted and caused one or more of the Company s current or future products to be nonconforming, the Company s sales of such products would be adversely affected.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The Company s sales and business could be materially and adversely affected if professional golfers do not endorse or use the Company s products.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The Company establishes relationships with professional golfers in order to evaluate and promote Callaway Golf and Odyssey branded products.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The Company has entered into endorsement arrangements with members of the various professional tours, including the Champions Tour, the PGA Tour, the LPGA Tour, the PGA European Tour, the Japan Golf Tour and the Nationwide Tour.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	While most professional golfers fulfill their contractual obligations, some have been known to stop using a sponsor s products despite contractual commitments.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	If certain of the Company s professional endorsers were to stop using the Company s products contrary to their endorsement agreements, the Company s business could be adversely affected in a material way by the negative publicity or lack of endorsement.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The Company believes that professional usage of its golf clubs and golf balls contributes to retail sales.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	The Company therefore spends a significant amount of money to secure professional usage of its products.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Many other companies, however, also aggressively seek the patronage of these professionals and offer many inducements, including significant cash incentives and specially designed products.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	There is a great deal of competition to secure the representation of tour professionals.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	As a result, it is expensive to attract and retain such tour professionals.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P37_S2	The inducements offered by other companies could result in a decrease in usage of the Company s products by professional golfers or limit the Company s ability to attract other tour professionals.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P37_S3	A decline in the level of professional usage of the Company s products, or a significant increase in the cost to attract or retain endorsers, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s sales and business.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Failure to adequately enforce the Company s intellectual property rights could adversely affect its reputation and sales.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The golf club industry, in general, has been characterized by widespread imitation of popular club designs.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The Company has an active program of monitoring, investigating and enforcing its proprietary rights against companies and individuals who market or manufacture counterfeits and knockoff products.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The Company asserts its rights against infringers of its copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade dress.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	However, these efforts may not be successful in reducing sales of golf products by these infringers.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	designs without infringing any of the Company s copyrights, patents, trademarks, or trade dress.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The failure to prevent or limit such infringers or imitators could adversely affect the Company s reputation and sales.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P40_S2	The Company may become subject to intellectual property suits that could cause it to incur significant costs or pay significant damages or that could prohibit it from selling its products.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P40_S3	The Company s competitors also seek to obtain patent, trademark, copyright or other protection of their proprietary rights and designs for golf clubs and golf balls.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P40_S4	From time to time, third parties have claimed or may claim in the future that the Company s products infringe upon their proprietary rights.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P40_S5	The Company evaluates any such claims and, where appropriate, has obtained or sought to obtain licenses or other business arrangements.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P40_S6	To date, there have been no significant interruptions in the Company s business as a result of any claims of infringement.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P40_S7	However, in the future, intellectual property claims could force the Company to alter its existing products or withdraw them from the market or could delay the introduction of new products.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Various patents have been issued to the Company s competitors in the golf industry and these competitors may assert that the Company s golf products infringe their patent or other proprietary rights.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If the Company s golf products are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights, the Company may be unable to obtain a license to use such technology, and it could incur substantial costs to redesign its products or to defend legal actions.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Recent changes to U.S. patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office could adversely affect the Company s ability to protect its intellectual property.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the Leahy-Smith Act ) includes a number of significant changes to the U.S. patent laws, such as, among other things, changing from a first to invent to a first inventor to file system, establishing new procedures for challenging patents and establishing different methods for invalidating patents.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is still in the process of implementing regulations relating to these changes, and the courts have yet to address many of the new provisions of the Leahy-Smith Act.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Some of these changes or potential changes may not be advantageous to the Company, and it may become more difficult to obtain adequate patent protection or to enforce the Company s patents against third parties.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P42_S3	While the Company cannot predict the impact of the Leahy-Smith Act at this time, these changes or potential changes could increase the costs and uncertainties surrounding the prosecution of the Company s patent applications and adversely affect the Company s ability to protect its intellectual property.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The Company s brands may be damaged by the actions of its licensees.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The Company licenses its trademarks to third-party licensees who produce, market and sell their products bearing the Company s trademarks.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The Company chooses its licensees carefully and imposes upon such licensees various restrictions on the products, and on the manner, on which such trademarks may be used.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P44_S2	In addition, the Company requires its licensees to abide by certain standards of conduct and the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P44_S3	However, if a licensee fails to adhere to these requirements, the Company s brands could be damaged.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P44_S4	The Company s brands could also be damaged if a licensee becomes insolvent or by any negative publicity concerning a licensee or if the licensee does not maintain good relationships with its customers or consumers, many of which are also the Company s customers and consumers.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P44_S5	Sales of the Company s products by unauthorized retailers or distributors could adversely affect the Company s authorized distribution channels and harm the Company s reputation.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P44_S6	Some of the Company s products find their way to unauthorized outlets or distribution channels.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P44_S7	This gray market for the Company s products can undermine authorized retailers and foreign wholesale distributors who promote and support the Company s products, and can injure the Company s image in the minds of its customers and consumers.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P44_S8	On the other hand, stopping such commerce could result in a potential decrease in sales to those customers who are selling the Company s products to unauthorized distributors or an increase in sales returns over historical levels.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P44_S9	While the Company has taken some lawful steps to limit commerce of its products in the gray market in both the United States and abroad, it has not stopped such commerce.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The Company has significant international operations and is exposed to risks associated with doing business globally.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P45_S1	The Company sells and distributes its products directly in many key international markets in Europe, Asia, North America and elsewhere around the world.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P45_S2	These activities have resulted and will continue to result in investments in inventory, accounts receivable, employees, corporate infrastructure and facilities.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P45_S3	In addition, there are a limited number of suppliers of golf club components in the United States, and the Company has increasingly become more reliant on suppliers and vendors located outside of the United States.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P45_S4	The operation of foreign distribution in the Company s international markets, as well as the management of relationships with international suppliers and vendors, will continue to require the dedication of management and other Company resources.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The Company manufactures most of its products outside of the United States.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	As a result of this international business, the Company is exposed to increased risks inherent in conducting business outside of the United States.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P46_S2	In addition to foreign currency risks, these risks include:
837465_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Increased exposure to interruptions in air carrier or ship services.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Any significant adverse change in circumstances or conditions could have a significant adverse effect upon the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P48_S2	We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The Company relies on complex information systems for management of its manufacturing, distribution, sales and other functions.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P49_S1	If the Company s information systems fail to perform these functions adequately or if the Company experiences an interruption in their operation, including a breach in cyber security, its business and results of operations could suffer.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	All of the Company s major operations, including manufacturing, distribution, sales and accounting, are dependent upon the Company s complex information systems.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	The Company s information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:
837465_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Hackers, computer viruses, software bugs or glitches.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Any damage or significant disruption in the operation of such systems or the failure of the Company s information systems to perform as expected would disrupt the Company s business, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess inventory and product shortages and otherwise adversely affect the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Unauthorized access to, or accidental disclosure of, consumer personally-identifiable information that the Company collects through its websites may result in significant expenses and negatively impact our reputation and business.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	There is growing concern over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	While the Company has implemented security measures, the Company s computer systems may be susceptible to electronic or physical computer break-ins, viruses and other disruptions and security breaches.
837465_14_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally-identifiable information regarding visitors to the Company s websites or otherwise, whether through a breach of the Company s network by an unauthorized party, employee theft, misuse or error or otherwise, could harm the Company s reputation, impair the Company s ability to attract website visitors, or subject the Company to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by consumers, and adversely affect the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	In February 2013, the Company sold its golf ball manufacturing plant in Chicopee, Massachusetts and entered into an agreement to lease back approximately 232,000 square feet, which the Company believes is adequate for ongoing business.
837465_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	The lease term for this facility expires in February 2018.
837465_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	The Company also leases a golf club manufacturing facility in Monterrey, Mexico comprised of approximately 180,000 square feet.
837465_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	The lease term for this facility expires in February 2018.
837465_14_ITEM2_P0_S4	In addition, the Company leases a distribution center in Roanoke, Texas comprised of approximately 202,000 square feet.
837465_14_ITEM2_P0_S5	The lease term for this facility expires in September 2020.
837465_14_ITEM2_P0_S6	The Company owns and leases additional properties domestically and internationally, including properties in the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom, China, Thailand and India.
837465_14_ITEM2_P0_S7	The Company s operations at each of these properties are used to some extent for both the golf club and golf ball businesses.
837465_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company believes that its facilities currently are adequate to meet its requirements.
837465_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to liquidity, capital availability and quarterly determinations that cash dividends are in the best interests of its stockholders.
837465_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	Future dividends may be affected by, among other items, the Company s views on potential future capital requirements, projected cash flows and needs, changes to the Company s business model, and certain restrictions limiting dividends imposed by the ABL Facility (see Note 4 Financing Arrangements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	Performance Graph The following graph presents a comparison of the cumulative total shareholder return of the Company s common stock since December 31, 2008 to two indices: the Standard Poor s 500 Index ( S P 500 ) and the Standard Poor s 600 Smallcap Index ( S P 600 ).
837465_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	The S P 500 tracks the aggregate price performance of equity securities of 500 large-cap companies that are actively traded in the U.S., and is considered to be a leading indicator of U.S. equity securities.
837465_14_ITEM5_P1_S2	The S P 600 is a market value-weighted index that tracks the aggregate price performance of equity securities from a broad range of small-cap stocks traded in the U.S.
837465_14_ITEM5_P1_S3	The graph assumes an initial investment of $100 at December 31, 2008 and reinvestment of all dividends in ELY stock on the dividend payable date.
837465_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	The Callaway Golf Company index is based upon the closing prices of Callaway Golf Company common stock on December 31, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 of $9.29, $7.54, $8.07, $5.53, $6.50 and $8.43, respectively.
837465_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers In November 2007, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of a maximum cost to the Company of $100.0 million (the November 2007 repurchase program ).

837465_14_ITEM5_P3_S2	During 2013, the Company repurchased approximately 56,000 shares of its common stock under the November 2007 repurchase program at an average cost per share of $6.50 for a total cost of $0.4 million.
837465_14_ITEM5_P3_S3	The Company acquired these shares to satisfy the Company s tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting and settlement of employee restricted stock unit awards.
837465_14_ITEM5_P3_S4	The Company s repurchases of shares of common stock are recorded at cost and result in a reduction of shareholders equity.
837465_14_ITEM5_P3_S5	During the three months ended December 31, 2013, the Company did not repurchase any additional shares under this program.
837465_14_ITEM5_P3_S6	In February 2014, the Board of Directors canceled this program and requested that management seek further Board approval prior to engaging in further open market transactions.
837465_14_ITEM5_P3_S7	The Board continued to authorize the Company to reacquire shares in satisfaction of the Company's tax withholding obligations in connection with the settlement of employee equity awards.

837465_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations, financial condition and liquidity are based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
837465_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, shareholders equity, sales and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
837465_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
837465_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
837465_14_ITEM7_P0_S4	On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business and new information as it becomes available.
837465_14_ITEM7_P0_S5	Management believes the critical accounting policies discussed below affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
837465_14_ITEM7_P0_S6	For a complete discussion of all of the Company s significant accounting policies, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, as products are shipped to customers, net of an allowance for sales returns and accruals for sales programs.
837465_14_ITEM7_P0_S7	The Company records a reserve for anticipated returns through a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the period that the related sales are recorded.
837465_14_ITEM7_P0_S8	Sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through of products.
837465_14_ITEM7_P0_S9	In addition, from time to time, the Company offers sales programs that allow for specific returns.
837465_14_ITEM7_P0_S10	The Company records a reserve for anticipated returns related to these sales programs based on the terms of the sales program as well as historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through of products.
837465_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	Historically, the Company s actual sales returns have not been materially different from management s original estimates.
837465_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance for sales returns.
837465_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	However, if the actual costs of sales returns are significantly different than the recorded estimated allowance, the Company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
837465_14_ITEM7_P1_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the recorded estimated allowance for 2013 sales returns, pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2013 would have been increased by approximately $0.7 million .
837465_14_ITEM7_P1_S4	The Company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings.
837465_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	Sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program, management s forecast of future product demand, and historical customer participation in similar programs.
837465_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Company s primary sales program, the Preferred Retailer Program, offers longer payment terms during the initial sell in period, as well as potential rebates and discounts, for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the Company, including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels, prime product placement and retailer staff training.
837465_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	Under this program, qualifying retailers can earn either discounts or rebates based upon the amount of product purchased.
837465_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	Discounts are applied and recorded at the time of sale.
837465_14_ITEM7_P3_S3	For rebates, the Company accrues an estimate of the rebate at the time of sale based on the customer s estimated qualifying current year product purchases.
837465_14_ITEM7_P3_S4	The estimate is based on the historical level of purchases, adjusted for any factors expected to affect the current year purchase levels.
837465_14_ITEM7_P3_S5	The estimated year-end rebate is adjusted quarterly based on actual purchase levels, as necessary.
837465_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Preferred Retailer Program is generally short term in nature and the actual costs of the program are known as of the end of the year and paid to customers shortly after year-end.
837465_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	In addition to the Preferred Retailer Program, the Company from time to time offers additional sales program incentive offerings which are also generally short term in nature.
837465_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Historically the Company s actual costs related to its Preferred Retailer Program and other sales programs have not been materially different than its estimates.
837465_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed.
837465_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	In addition, the Company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws.
837465_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	The Company s gift cards have no expiration.
837465_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	the Company analyzes an aging of unredeemed cards (based on the date the card was last used or the activation date if the card has never been used) and compares that information with historical redemption trends.
837465_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to determine the timing of recognition of gift card revenues.
837465_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	However, if the Company is not able to accurately determine when gift card redemption is remote, the Company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
837465_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	The deferred revenue associated with outstanding gift cards decreased to $1.0 million at December 31, 2013 from $1.1 million at December 31, 2012.
837465_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Revenues from course credits in connection with the use of the Company s uPro GPS devices are deferred when purchased and recognized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.
837465_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	Although the Company announced in July 2012 the transition of its integrated device business to a third-party based model, the Company will continue to maintain services related to course credits used in conjunction with the uPro GPS devices through December 31, 2014.
837465_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	Deferred revenue associated with unused course credits decreased from $2.5 million at December 31, 2012 to $1.8 million at December 31, 2013 .
837465_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments.
837465_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	An estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, the customer s financial condition and current economic trends, all of which are subject to change.
837465_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	If the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance, the Company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected.
837465_14_ITEM7_P9_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the 2013 recorded estimated allowance for doubtful accounts, pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2013 would have been increased by approximately $1.2 million .
837465_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value.
837465_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
837465_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	The inventory balance, which includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs, is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory.
837465_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	The estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon current inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience as well as management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand, all of which are subject to change.
837465_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	The calculation of the Company s allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand and pricing, regulatory (USGA and R A) rule changes, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence.
837465_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance.
837465_14_ITEM7_P12_S4	However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner, the Company may need to increase its inventory allowance, which could significantly adversely affect the Company s operating results.
837465_14_ITEM7_P12_S5	Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the 2013 recorded estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory, pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2013 would have been increased by approximately $1.9 million .
837465_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company acquires tangible and intangible assets.
837465_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and amortizing intangible assets, and investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable or exceeds its fair value.
837465_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	The Company evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually or whenever indicators that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable are present.
837465_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining the amount of undiscounted cash flows directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, the timing of the impairment test, and the asset s residual value, if any.
837465_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	To determine fair value, the Company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate.
837465_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the asset and a charge to earnings.
837465_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	The Company uses its best judgment based on current facts and circumstances related to its business when making these estimates.
837465_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	However, if actual results are not consistent with the Company s estimates and assumptions used in calculating future cash flows and asset fair values, the Company may be exposed to losses that could be material.
837465_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , the estimated fair values of the Company s reporting units in the U.S., United Kingdom, Canada and Korea, as well as the estimated fair values of certain trade names and trademarks, exceeded their carrying values.
837465_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	In September 2012, in connection with the Company s cost reduction initiatives (the "Cost Reduction Initiatives") that were announced in July 2012, the Company committed to a plan to transition its integrated device business to a third-party based model and determined that it would no longer be using or enforcing the trademarks and technology acquired from the uPlay LLC acquisition.
837465_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $5.1 million in 2012 to write-off amortizing intangible assets and goodwill associated with the uPlay, LLC acquisition as these assets were no longer considered recoverable.
837465_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	In addition, the Company wrote-off the net carrying value of long lived assets related to uPro GPS devices, which resulted in a $4.0 million charge to property, plant and equipment as these assets were also not considered recoverable.
837465_14_ITEM7_P17_S3	See Note 8 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Goodwill and Intangible Assets in this Form 10-K. In the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized impairment charges of $4.6 million and $5.4 million, respectively, in connection with the trade names, trademarks and other intangible assets related to the Top-Flite and Ben Hogan brands.
837465_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	The Company used the relief from royalty method (the RFR Method ), which is a discounted cash flow model, for evaluating the recoverability of its Top-Flite and Ben Hogan trademarks and service marks.
837465_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	The material assumptions used in the RFR Method were comprised of discount rates, revenue forecasts, long-term revenue growth rates and estimated royalty rates.
837465_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	The discount rates were based on a weighted average cost of capital, which represents the average rate a market participant would pay to raise debt or equity financing.
837465_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	The discount rates were calculated based upon market data available at the end of the applicable reporting period.
837465_14_ITEM7_P18_S4	The Company determined the revenue forecasts based on historical sales, economic conditions, expected industry performance, and planned product launches.
837465_14_ITEM7_P18_S5	The Company based its long-term revenue growth rates on projected inflation rates.
837465_14_ITEM7_P18_S6	The royalty rates used were within the range the Company historically charged to apparel licensees for those brands.
837465_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	In applying the RFR Method, the Company considers the revenue forecast to be the most subjective and to have the most uncertainty associated with it.
837465_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	It was determined, assuming all other inputs remained constant, that a 10% decrease in the assumed revenue forecast would have resulted in an additional impairment of $1.8 million for 2011.
837465_14_ITEM7_P19_S2	For 2012, there was no impairment analysis performed on the Company s Top-Flite and Ben Hogan non-amortizing intangibles assets as these assets were sold during the first quarter of 2012.
837465_14_ITEM7_P19_S3	The impairment charge in 2012 related to the amortizing intangible assets (i.e. patents) acquired during the Top-Flite and Ben Hogan acquisition.
837465_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company changed its intellectual property strategy as part of its 2012 Restructuring Initiatives.
837465_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	As part of this new strategy, the Company determined it would no longer be using or enforcing these patents, resulting in a $4.6 million impairment charge as the carrying amount of these assets was no longer considered recoverable.
837465_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	See Note 8 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Goodwill and Intangible Assets in this Form 10-K. In 2011, the Company performed an impairment analysis on goodwill related to its reporting unit in Australia.
837465_14_ITEM7_P20_S3	In completing this analysis, the Company determined that the carrying value of this reporting unit including goodwill exceeded the estimated discounted future cash flows that would be generated from this unit and as a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $1.1 million to write-off goodwill related to this reporting unit.
837465_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Company has a stated two-year warranty policy for its golf clubs.
837465_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	The Company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded.
837465_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	In estimating its future warranty obligations, the Company considers various relevant factors, including the Company s stated warranty policies and practices, the historical frequency of claims, and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty.
837465_14_ITEM7_P21_S3	The Company s estimates for calculating the warranty reserve are principally based on assumptions regarding the warranty costs of each club product line over the expected warranty period.
837465_14_ITEM7_P21_S4	Where little or no claims experience may exist, the Company s warranty obligation calculation is based upon long-term historical warranty rates of similar products until sufficient data is available.
837465_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	As actual model-specific rates become available, the Company s estimates are modified to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes.
837465_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Historically, the Company s actual warranty claims have not been materially different from management s original estimated warranty obligation.
837465_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the warranty obligation.
837465_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	However, if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims were to significantly exceed the estimated warranty reserve, the Company may be exposed to losses that could be material.
837465_14_ITEM7_P23_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the 2013 recorded estimated allowance for warranty obligations, pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2013 would have been increased by approximately $0.6 million .
837465_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Income Taxes Current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year.
837465_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
837465_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	The Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
837465_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire.
837465_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment, including estimates of future taxable income.
837465_14_ITEM7_P25_S4	These estimates are based on the Company s best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions.
837465_14_ITEM7_P25_S5	In 2011, as a result of this evaluation, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_14_ITEM7_P25_S6	At the end of each interim and annual reporting period, as the U.S. deferred tax assets are adjusted upwards or downwards, the associated valuation allowance and income tax expense are also adjusted.
837465_14_ITEM7_P25_S7	If sufficient positive evidence arises in the future, such as a sustained return to profitability in the U.S. business, the valuation allowance could be reversed as appropriate, decreasing income tax expense in the period that such conclusion is reached.
837465_14_ITEM7_P25_S8	The Company has concluded that with respect to non-U.S. entities, there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that the realization of its deferred tax assets is deemed to be likely, and no allowances have been established.
837465_14_ITEM7_P25_S9	In addition, the Company has discontinued recognizing income tax benefits related to its U.S. net operating losses until it is determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefits from its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_14_ITEM7_P25_S10	Pursuant to ASC Topic 740-25-6, the Company is required to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is deemed to be more likely than not that the Company would be required to pay such additional taxes.
837465_14_ITEM7_P25_S11	The Company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions.
837465_14_ITEM7_P25_S12	The preparation of these income tax returns requires the Company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by the Company.
837465_14_ITEM7_P25_S13	The Company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability, including interest and penalties, for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return.
837465_14_ITEM7_P25_S14	The Company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available.
837465_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Historically, additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the Company s uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the Company s expectations.
837465_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	Information regarding income taxes is contained in Note 12 Income Taxes to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
837465_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	Share-based Compensation The Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and non-employees based on estimated fair values.
837465_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	ASC Topic 718 further requires a reduction in share-based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	The forfeiture rate used by the Company is based on historical forfeiture trends.
837465_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	If actual forfeitures are not consistent with the Company s estimates, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods.
837465_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options and stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) at the date of grant.
837465_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the Company s expected stock price volatility, the expected dividend yield, the expected term of an option or SAR and the risk-free interest rate, which is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
837465_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected price volatility and the expected term.
837465_14_ITEM7_P29_S3	The Company uses forecasted dividends to estimate the expected dividend yield.
837465_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option or SAR.
837465_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option or SAR does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee.
837465_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for stock options.
837465_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	Compensation expense for SARs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an award s estimated fair value, which is remeasured at the end of each reporting period.
837465_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	Once vested, SARs continued to be remeasured to fair value until they are exercised.
837465_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	The Company records compensation expense for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (collectively restricted stock ) based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
837465_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	The estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares awarded.
837465_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, reduced by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	Phantom stock units ( PSUs ) are a form of share-based awards that are indexed to the Company s stock and are settled in cash.
837465_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	Compensation expense for PSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the award s estimated fair value.
837465_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	Fair value is remeasured at the end of each interim reporting period through the award s settlement date and is based on the closing price of the Company s stock.
837465_14_ITEM7_P33_S3	Recent Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by this reference.
837465_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	Results of Operations Overview of Business, Seasonality and Foreign Currency The Company designs, manufactures and sells high quality golf clubs and golf balls, and also sells golf accessories, such as golf apparel and footwear, golf bags, golf gloves, travel gear, headwear and other golf-related accessories.
837465_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	In addition, the Company licenses its trademarks and service marks in exchange for a royalty fee to third parties for use on golf related accessories, including golf apparel and footwear, golf gloves, umbrellas, prescription eyewear, and practice aids.
837465_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Company designs its products to be technologically advanced and in this regard invests a considerable amount in research and development each year.
837465_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	The Company s golf products are designed for golfers of all skill levels, both amateur and professional.
837465_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	The Company has two operating segments that are organized on the basis of products, namely the golf clubs segment and golf balls segment.
837465_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	The golf clubs segment consists primarily of Callaway Golf woods, hybrids, irons and wedges, and Odyssey putters.
837465_14_ITEM7_P36_S3	This segment also includes other golf-related accessories described above and royalties from licensing of the Company s trademarks and service marks as well as sales of pre-owned golf clubs.
837465_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	The golf balls segment consists of Callaway Golf and Strata golf balls.
837465_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	The Company sold the Top-Flite and Ben Hogan brands in March 2012 (see Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
837465_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	As discussed in Note 19 Segment Information to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company s operating segments exclude a significant amount of corporate general administrative expenses and other income (expense) not utilized by management in determining segment profitability.
837465_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	In most of the regions where the Company does business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis.
837465_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	Weather conditions in most parts of the world generally restrict golf from being played year-round, with many of the Company s on-course customers closing during the cold weather months.
837465_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	The Company s business is therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season.
837465_14_ITEM7_P40_S4	This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter.
837465_14_ITEM7_P40_S5	The Company s second quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter.
837465_14_ITEM7_P40_S6	The Company s third quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but are generally less than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season.
837465_14_ITEM7_P40_S7	The Company s fourth quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company s key markets.
837465_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	and fourth quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year.
837465_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	This seasonality, and therefore quarter to quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as well as weather conditions.
837465_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	In general, however, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company s sales and most, if not all, of its profitability generally occurs during the first half of the year.
837465_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	More than half of the Company s business is conducted in regions outside of the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
837465_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	As a result, changes in foreign currency rates can have a significant effect on the Company s financial results.
837465_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	The Company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates.
837465_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	While these foreign currency exchange contracts can mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates, they do not eliminate those effects, which can be significant.
837465_14_ITEM7_P42_S4	These effects include (i) the translation of results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, (ii) the mark-to-market adjustments of certain intercompany balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies, and (iii) the mark-to-market adjustments on the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts.
837465_14_ITEM7_P42_S5	In general, the Company s overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts its business.
837465_14_ITEM7_P42_S6	During 2013, the Company s reported net sales in regions outside the U.S. were negatively affected by the translation of foreign currency sales into U.S. dollars based on 2013 exchange rates.
837465_14_ITEM7_P42_S7	If 2012 exchange rates were applied to 2013 reported net sales in regions outside the U.S. and all other factors were held constant, net sales in such regions would have been $39.8 million higher than the net sales reported in 2013.
837465_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Executive Summary The Company s results for the year ended December 31, 2013 include sales growth as well as significant improvements in gross margins, operating expenses, and operating income compared to the prior year.
837465_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	During 2013, the Company refocused its business on golf equipment and more performance-oriented products, leveraged its strengths in research and development, and changed its approach to sales and marketing.
837465_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	The Company also retired all of its preferred stock thus lowering its cost of capital, increased its presence on tour, and completed the transition of its golf ball and golf club manufacturing platforms.
837465_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	These improvements not only reflect the continued progress of the Company s turnaround plan, but also the increased hard goods market share and brand momentum the Company experienced in 2013.
837465_14_ITEM7_P44_S3	The Company s net sales increased approximately 1% in 2013 compared to the prior year despite adverse changes in foreign currency rates, the sale in 2012 of the Top-Flite and Ben Hogan Brands, and the transition to a licensing arrangement for apparel and footwear in North America.
837465_14_ITEM7_P44_S4	The sale of these brands and licensing arrangements negatively impacted sales by $57.2 million in 2013 compared to 2012.
837465_14_ITEM7_P44_S5	In addition, changes in foreign currency rates negatively affected net sales by $39.8 million in 2013 compared to 2012.
837465_14_ITEM7_P44_S6	On a constant currency basis, the Company s current business, which excludes the sold or transitioned brands and businesses, achieved 14% sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the prior year.
837465_14_ITEM7_P44_S7	In addition to improved sales, the Company's gross margin and operating expenses improved and the charges related to the Cost Reduction Initiatives were significantly less during 2013 compared to 2012.
837465_14_ITEM7_P44_S8	Gross margin increased by 750 basis points to 37.3% in 2013 compared to 29.8% in 2012.
837465_14_ITEM7_P44_S9	This improvement was primarily driven by (i) a $22.1 million decline in charges associated with the Company s 2012 Cost Reduction Initiatives, (ii) increased sales of higher margin woods products in 2013, primarily due to the current year success of the X Hot line of woods and mid-year product launches, and (iii) less promotional activity by the Company in the current year.
837465_14_ITEM7_P44_S10	Gross margin was also favorably affected by improved manufacturing efficiencies and a lower cost structure resulting from the Company's Cost Reduction Initiatives.
837465_14_ITEM7_P44_S11	Additionally, as a result of these initiatives, as well as a continued focus on cost management, the Company's operating expenses decreased by $38.9 million or 11% in 2013 compared to 2012.
837465_14_ITEM7_P44_S12	In total, the Company incurred charges of $16.6 million in connection with the Cost Reduction Initiatives in 2013 compared to $54.1 million in 2012.
837465_14_ITEM7_P44_S13	These improvements, along with the Company s improved brand momentum resulting from the success of the Company's 2013 product line, enabled the Company to overcome the adverse effects of changes in foreign currency rates, and the impact of the sold or transitioned businesses.

837465_14_ITEM7_P51_S3	This increase was primarily due to the recognition of a $6.6 million net gain in connection with the sale of the Company s Top-Flite and Ben Hogan brands during the first half of 2012, in addition to a $4.3 million increase in bad debt expense in 2013.
837465_14_ITEM7_P51_S4	These increases were partially offset by the Cost Reduction Initiatives, which resulted in a $5.4 million decline in employee costs, travel and entertainment and expenses in connection with the Company's wind-down of its GPS device business, in addition to a decrease of $4.2 million in professional fees and depreciation and amortization expense.
837465_14_ITEM7_P51_S5	Research and development expenses increased by $1.4 million to $30.9 million (3.7% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $29.5 million (3.5% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2012 , primarily due to an increase in employee costs as a result of accrued employee incentive compensation in 2013.

837465_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	The increase in average selling prices was due to the introduction of the X Hot and Razr Fit Xtreme woods at higher average selling prices than their predecessors, the Razr X and Razr Fit woods sold in the prior year.
837465_14_ITEM7_P53_S3	The $11.0 million (6%) increase in net sales of irons to $181.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily attributable to the strong performance of the current year X Hot irons and Mack Daddy 2 wedges combined with an increase in average selling prices resulting from less promotional activity in the current year as a result of more optimal inventory levels at retail.
837465_14_ITEM7_P53_S4	The $3.7 million (4%) decrease in net sales of putters to $89.6 million for the year December 31, 2013 was primarily attributable to a decline in both sales volume and average selling prices due to an overall decline in the putter category this year.

837465_14_ITEM7_P60_S3	The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by (i) a favorable shift in sales mix from sales of lower margin golf accessories to increased sales of higher margin golf club products primarily related to the current year success of the X Hot family of clubs; (ii) a decline in charges associated with the Company's Cost Reduction Initiatives; and (iii) improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower costs resulting from the Company's Cost Reduction Initiatives.
837465_14_ITEM7_P60_S4	These increases were partially offset by an increase in club component costs due to more expensive materials and technology incorporated into the X Hot family of woods and White Hot Pro putters, in addition to an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_14_ITEM7_P60_S5	Pre-tax income in the Company s golf balls operating segment improved to $1.6 million for 2013 from pre-tax loss of $15.0 million for 2012.

837465_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	This decline was partially offset by an increase in sales in Japan.
837465_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	In 2011, sales in Japan were negatively affected by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
837465_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	Additionally, the Company s reported net sales in regions outside the United States in 2012 were unfavorably affected by the translation of foreign currency sales into U.S. dollars based upon 2012 exchange rates.

837465_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	In addition, gross margin was negatively affected by increased promotional activity during 2012 primarily on in-line drivers, fairway woods and irons products, as well as an increase in club component costs due to a combination of more expensive premium materials and technology incorporated into the 2012 new product line.

837465_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	The dollar increase was primarily due to increases of $13.0 million in advertising and promotional activities, which is consistent with the Company s Reorganization and Reinvestment Initiatives announced in June 2011, in addition to a $4.6 million increase in restructuring charges associated with the Company s Cost Reduction Initiatives announced in July 2012.
837465_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $10.3 million in employee costs primarily as a result of a reduction in headcount period over period, as well as a decrease of $1.7 million in travel expenses.

837465_14_ITEM7_P67_S7	This decrease was primarily due to a $3.4 million decrease in employee costs primarily as a result of a reduction in headcount period over period, partially offset by charges incurred in connection with the Company s Cost Reduction Initiatives announced in July 2012.
837465_14_ITEM7_P67_S8	Interest expense increased by $3.9 million to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $1.6 million in the comparable period of 2011.

837465_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	The $10.6 million (5%) decrease in net sales of woods to $200.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices combined with a slight decline in sales volume.
837465_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	The decrease in average selling prices resulted primarily from increased promotional activity during 2012 of certain in-line drivers compared to predecessor products during 2011.
837465_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	In addition, net sales were negatively impacted by the later planned launch timing of the Company s premium Legacy drivers which were launched during the third quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter in 2011.
837465_14_ITEM7_P70_S3	This decline in average selling prices was partially offset by a favorable shift in sales mix resulting from fewer sales of lower priced hybrids in 2012.
837465_14_ITEM7_P70_S4	The slight decrease in sales volume was primarily due to a decline in hybrid club sales.
837465_14_ITEM7_P70_S5	The $36.0 million (17%) decrease in net sales of irons to $170.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily attributable to declines in average selling prices and sales volume.
837465_14_ITEM7_P70_S6	The decline in average selling prices was primarily due to an unfavorable shift in product mix from sales of higher priced RAZR X models in the prior year to sales of more moderately priced irons products during 2012.
837465_14_ITEM7_P70_S7	The Company s average selling prices were also negatively impacted by increased promotional activity during 2012 compared to the prior year.
837465_14_ITEM7_P70_S8	The decline in sales volume was primarily due to declines in market share resulting from less favorable consumer acceptance of the irons models launched in the current year compared to the strong performance of RAZR X launched in 2011.
837465_14_ITEM7_P70_S9	The $5.2 million (6%) increase in net sales of putters to $93.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily due to an increase in sales volume partially offset by a decline in average selling prices.
837465_14_ITEM7_P70_S10	The increase in sales volume was due to the current year launch of the Metal X platform of putters.
837465_14_ITEM7_P70_S11	The decline in average selling prices was largely attributable to increased closeout activity in preparation for the Metal X platform launch.
837465_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	The $9.8 million (4%) increase in net sales of accessories and other products to $229.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily driven by an increase in sales of: (i) packaged sets due to the launch of the new Callaway Jr. sets and Top-Flite packaged sets; (ii) apparel primarily due to the sale of golf apparel in Europe and South Pacific beginning in the third quarter of 2011; (iii) GPS devices due to the 2012 launch of the Company s new MX+ GPS device; and (iv) an increase in sales of golf bags.
837465_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	These increases were partially offset by a decline in sales of footwear and headwear in 2012 compared to the prior year.
837465_14_ITEM7_P71_S2	Golf Balls Segment Net sales information for the golf balls segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	The $20.8 million (13%) decrease in net sales of golf balls to $139.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in sales volume partially offset by an increase in average selling prices.
837465_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	The decrease in sales volume was primarily due to a decline in sales of Top-Flite balls primarily resulting from the sale of the Top-Flite brand in March 2012.
837465_14_ITEM7_P72_S2	In recent years, sales of Top-Flite and Ben Hogan branded golf balls have represented approximately 25% of the Company s total golf ball annual sales.
837465_14_ITEM7_P72_S3	The increase in average selling prices was due to a favorable shift in sales mix from lower priced Top-Flite balls to higher priced Callaway golf balls combined with the successful current year launch of the HX Chrome and HX Black Tour balls.
837465_14_ITEM7_P72_S4	Segment Profitability Profitability by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	(1) Included in the Company s golf clubs and golf balls segments are the following pre-tax charges:
837465_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	$15.6 million and $5.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2011, in connection with the final phase of the Company s GOS initiatives.
837465_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	$5.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2011 in connection with the Company s Reorganization and Reinvestment Initiatives.
837465_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	See Note 3 Restructuring Initiatives to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding the initiatives referenced herein.
837465_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	(2) Reconciling items represent corporate general and administrative expenses and other income (expense) not included by management in determining segment profitability.
837465_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2012, the reconciling items include:
837465_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	Net gains of $3.2 million related to foreign currency hedging contracts offset by foreign currency transaction losses.
837465_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the reconciling items include:
837465_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	Net losses of $8.2 million related to foreign currency hedging contracts offset by foreign currency transaction gains.
837465_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	Pre-tax loss in the Company s golf clubs operating segment increased to $59.8 million for 2012 from $3.9 million for 2011.
837465_14_ITEM7_P78_S2	This increase was primarily attributable to a $58.9 million decrease in gross margin combined with a decrease in net sales as discussed above, offset by a decrease in operating expenses.
837465_14_ITEM7_P78_S3	The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by $30.4 million of charges incurred in connection with the Company s Cost Reduction Initiatives announced in July 2012 compared to $21.2 million of charges incurred in 2011 related to the Company s Reorganization and Reinvestment and GOS Initiatives.
837465_14_ITEM7_P78_S4	In addition, club margins were negatively affected by sales promotions, closeout activity and increased club component costs as compared to the same period in 2011.
837465_14_ITEM7_P78_S5	Pre-tax loss in the Company s golf balls operating segment increased to $15.0 million for 2012 from $12.7 million for 2011.
837465_14_ITEM7_P78_S6	This increase in pre-tax loss was primarily attributable to a decrease in net sales primarily due to the sale of the Top-Flite and Ben Hogan Brands, as discussed above combined with a $4.3 million decrease in gross margin, offset by a decrease in operating expenses.
837465_14_ITEM7_P78_S7	The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by $16.6 million of charges incurred in connection with the Company s Cost Reduction Initiatives announced in July 2012, compared to $6.3 million of charges incurred in 2011 related to the Company s Reorganization and Reinvestment and GOS Initiatives.
837465_14_ITEM7_P78_S8	This decrease was partially offset by an increase in average selling prices due to the current year launch of the premium Hex Black Tour golf ball, with no comparable launch in the prior year.
837465_14_ITEM7_P78_S9	Financial Condition The Company s cash and cash equivalents decreased $15.2 million to $36.8 million at December 31, 2013, from $52.0 million at December 31, 2012.
837465_14_ITEM7_P78_S10	During 2013, the Company used its cash and cash equivalents combined with net borrowings of $25.7 million under its ABL Facility (as defined in Note 4 Financing Arrangements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K) to fund $8.9 million of cash used in operating activities, which included increased incremental inventory purchases of $51.8 million due to the earlier timing of purchases year over year, in addition to $13.0 million in capital expenditures and $13.6 million in investments in TopGolf International, Inc. (see Note 9 to the Company's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_14_ITEM7_P78_S11	Management expects to fund the Company s future operations from cash on hand, cash provided by its operating activities, and borrowings from the ABL Facility, as deemed necessary (see further information on the ABL Facility in Liquidity and Capital Resources below).
837465_14_ITEM7_P78_S12	The Company s accounts receivable balance fluctuates throughout the year as a result of the general seasonality of the Company s business.
837465_14_ITEM7_P78_S13	The Company s accounts receivable balance will generally be at its highest during the first and second quarters and decline significantly during the third and fourth quarters as a result of an increase in cash collections and lower sales.
837465_14_ITEM7_P78_S14	As of December 31, 2013, the Company s net accounts receivable increased $1.1 million to $92.2 million from $91.1 million as of December 31, 2012.
837465_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	to the fourth quarter of 2012, combined with an increase in past due receivables primarily due to two significant customers.
837465_14_ITEM7_P79_S1	This increase was partially offset by an increase in bad debt reserves.
837465_14_ITEM7_P79_S2	The Company s inventory balance also fluctuates throughout the year as a result of the general seasonality of the Company s business.
837465_14_ITEM7_P79_S3	Generally, the Company s buildup of inventory levels begins during the fourth quarter and continues heavily into the first quarter as well as into the beginning of the second quarter in order to meet demand during the height of the golf season.
837465_14_ITEM7_P79_S4	Inventory levels start to decline toward the end of the second quarter and are at their lowest during the third quarter.
837465_14_ITEM7_P79_S5	Inventory levels are also impacted by the timing of new product launches.
837465_14_ITEM7_P79_S6	The Company s net inventory increased $51.8 million to $263.5 million as of December 31, 2013 compared to $211.7 million as of December 31, 2012.
837465_14_ITEM7_P79_S7	This increase was primarily due to the earlier timing of inventory purchases year over year related to planned product launches.
837465_14_ITEM7_P79_S8	Net inventories as a percentage of the trailing twelve months net sales increased to 31.3% as of December 31, 2013 compared to 25.4% as of December 31, 2012.
837465_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources The information set forth in Note 4 Financing Arrangements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, is incorporated herein by this reference.
837465_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	Liquidity The Company s principal sources of liquidity consist of its existing cash balances, funds expected to be generated from operations and the ABL Facility.
837465_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	The Company experienced negative cash flows from operations in 2009 through 2013.
837465_14_ITEM7_P81_S2	During the second half of 2012, the Company implemented significant changes to its business, including among other things, steps designed to increase product sales as well as initiatives designed to reduce the Company s manufacturing costs and operating expenses.
837465_14_ITEM7_P81_S3	As a result of these initiatives, in 2013, the Company realized an increase in net sales, reduced its operating expenses, and improved its cash flows from operations.
837465_14_ITEM7_P81_S4	Based upon the Company s current cash balances, its estimates of funds expected to be generated from operations in 2014, and current and projected availability under the ABL Facility, the Company believes that it will be able to finance current and planned operating requirements, capital expenditures, contractual obligations and commercial commitments for at least the next 12 months.
837465_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	The Company s ability to generate sufficient positive cash flows from operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including future economic trends and conditions, the success of the Company s multi-year turnaround, demand for the Company s products, foreign currency exchange rates, and other risks and uncertainties applicable to the Company and its business (see Risk Factors contained in Part I, Item 1A).
837465_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	While management believes the Company's recovery is on track, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to generate sufficient operating cash flows in the future or maintain or grow its existing cash balances.
837465_14_ITEM7_P82_S2	If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows to fund its business due to a further decline in sales or otherwise and is unable to reduce its manufacturing costs and operating expenses to offset such decline, the Company will need to increase its reliance on the ABL Facility for needed liquidity.
837465_14_ITEM7_P82_S3	If the ABL Facility is not then available or sufficient and the Company could not secure alternative financing arrangements, the Company s future operations would be significantly, adversely affected.
837465_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	As of December 31, 2013, a significant portion of the Company s total cash is held in regions outside of the U.S.
837465_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	In addition to settling intercompany balances during the normal course of operations, the Company may repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries.
837465_14_ITEM7_P83_S2	The Company has not, nor does it anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with its domestic debt service requirements.
837465_14_ITEM7_P83_S3	As such, the Company considers the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon.
837465_14_ITEM7_P83_S4	If in the future the Company decides to repatriate such foreign earnings, it would need to accrue and pay incremental U.S. federal and state income tax, reduced by the current amount of available U.S. federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
837465_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	In November 2007, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of a maximum cost to the Company of $100.0 million (the November 2007 repurchase program ).
837465_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	Under this program, the Company was authorized to repurchase shares of its common stock in the open market or in private transactions, subject to the Company s assessment of market conditions and buying opportunities.
837465_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	During 2013, the Company repurchased approximately 56,000 shares of its common stock under the November 2007 repurchase program at an average cost per share of $6.50 for a total cost of $0.4 million.
837465_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	The Company acquired these shares to satisfy the Company s tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting and settlement of employee restricted stock unit awards.
837465_14_ITEM7_P85_S2	The Company s repurchases of shares of common stock are recorded at cost and result in a reduction of shareholders equity.
837465_14_ITEM7_P85_S3	In February 2014, the Board of Directors canceled this program and requested that management seek further Board approval prior to engaging in further open market transactions.
837465_14_ITEM7_P85_S4	The Board continued to authorize the Company to reacquire shares in satisfaction of the Company's tax withholding obligations in connection with the settlement of employee equity awards.
837465_14_ITEM7_P85_S5	The following table summarizes certain significant cash obligations as of December 31, 2013 that will affect the Company s future liquidity (in millions):
837465_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	(2) Amounts represent future minimum lease payments.
837465_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	Capital lease obligations are included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
837465_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	(3) The Company leases certain warehouse, distribution and office facilities, vehicles and office equipment under operating leases.
837465_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	The amounts presented in this line item represent commitments for minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases.
837465_14_ITEM7_P87_S2	(4) During the normal course of its business, the Company enters into agreements to purchase goods and services, including purchase commitments for production materials, endorsement agreements with professional golfers and other endorsers, employment and consulting agreements, and intellectual property licensing agreements pursuant to which the Company is required to pay royalty fees.
837465_14_ITEM7_P87_S3	the Company s sales levels, and reductions in payment obligations if designated minimum performance criteria are not achieved.
837465_14_ITEM7_P87_S4	The amounts listed approximate minimum purchase obligations, base compensation, and guaranteed minimum royalty payments the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements.
837465_14_ITEM7_P87_S5	The actual amounts paid under some of these agreements may be higher or lower than the amounts included.
837465_14_ITEM7_P87_S6	In the aggregate, the actual amount paid under these obligations is likely to be higher than the amounts listed as a result of the variable nature of these obligations.
837465_14_ITEM7_P87_S7	In addition, the Company also enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders or other documentation or that are undocumented except for an invoice.
837465_14_ITEM7_P87_S8	Such unconditional purchase obligations are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected in this line item.
837465_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	(5) Amount represents the current and non-current portions of uncertain income tax positions as recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013.
837465_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	Amount excludes uncertain income tax positions that the Company would be able to offset against deferred taxes.
837465_14_ITEM7_P88_S2	For further discussion see Note 12 Income Taxes to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
837465_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	(6) Amount represents accrued employee incentive compensation expense earned in 2013, and paid in February 2014.
837465_14_ITEM7_P89_S1	(7) Consists primarily of cash-settled phantom stock units and stock appreciation rights (see Note 15 "Share-Based Compensation" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	During its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions.
837465_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	These include (i) intellectual property indemnities to the Company s customers and licensees in connection with the use, sale and/or license of Company products or trademarks, (ii) indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facilities or leases, (iii) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to the goods or services provided to the Company or based on the negligence or willful misconduct of the Company and (iv) indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts.
837465_14_ITEM7_P90_S2	In addition, the Company has made contractual commitments to each of its officers and certain other employees providing for severance payments upon the termination of employment.
837465_14_ITEM7_P90_S3	The Company also has consulting agreements that provide for payment of nominal fees upon the issuance of patents and/or the commercialization of research results.
837465_14_ITEM7_P90_S4	The Company has also issued guarantees in the form of a standby letter of credit in the amount of $1.3 million as security for contingent liabilities under certain workers compensation insurance policies.
837465_14_ITEM7_P90_S5	The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases may be indefinite.
837465_14_ITEM7_P90_S6	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be obligated to make.
837465_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	Historically, costs incurred to settle claims related to indemnities have not been material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_14_ITEM7_P91_S1	In addition, the Company believes the likelihood is remote that payments under the commitments and guarantees described above will have a material effect on the Company s financial condition.
837465_14_ITEM7_P91_S2	The fair value of indemnities, commitments and guarantees that the Company issued during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 was not material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_14_ITEM7_P91_S3	In addition to the contractual obligations listed above, the Company s liquidity could also be adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome with respect to claims and litigation that the Company is subject to from time to time.
837465_14_ITEM7_P91_S4	See Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Capital Resources The Company does not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures.
837465_14_ITEM7_P91_S5	The Company has no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in S-K 303(a)(4)(ii).
837465_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions of its international subsidiaries, including certain balance sheet exposures (payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies) (see Note 18 Derivatives and Hedging to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	In addition, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from the translation of the operating results of the Company s international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.
837465_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Australian Dollars and South Korean Won.
837465_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	For most currencies, the Company is a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefits from a weaker U.S. dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which the Company transacts significant amounts of business.
837465_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Foreign currency exchange contracts are used only to meet the Company s objectives of offsetting gains and losses from foreign currency exchange exposures with gains and losses from the contracts used to hedge them in order to reduce volatility of earnings.
837465_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The extent to which the Company s hedging activities mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates varies based upon many factors, including the amount of transactions being hedged.
837465_14_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Foreign currency rates for financial reporting purposes had a negative impact upon the Company s consolidated reported financial results in 2013 compared to 2012 (see Risk Factors contained in Item 1A and Results of Operations contained in Item 7).
837465_14_ITEM7A_P2_S4	The Company does not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for speculative purposes.
837465_14_ITEM7A_P2_S5	Foreign currency exchange contracts generally mature within 12 months from their inception.
837465_14_ITEM7A_P2_S6	The Company does not designate foreign currency exchange contracts as derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
837465_14_ITEM7A_P2_S7	As such, changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized in earnings in the period of change.
837465_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	At December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011, the notional amounts of the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts used to hedge the exposures discussed above were approximately $42.3 million , $137.1 million and $165.5 million , respectively.
837465_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, there were no outstanding foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for anticipated sales denominated in foreign currencies.
837465_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	As part of the Company s risk management procedure, a sensitivity analysis model is used to measure the potential loss in future earnings of market-sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates or foreign currency values.
837465_14_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The sensitivity analysis model quantifies the estimated potential effect of unfavorable movements of 10% in foreign currencies to which the Company was exposed at December 31, 2013 through its foreign currency exchange contracts.
837465_14_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The estimated maximum one-day loss from the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts, calculated using the sensitivity analysis model described above, is $4.3 million at December 31, 2013 .
837465_14_ITEM7A_P4_S3	The Company believes that such a hypothetical loss from its foreign currency exchange contracts would be partially offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged.
837465_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The sensitivity analysis model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in earnings that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates.
837465_14_ITEM7A_P5_S1	It also does not represent the maximum possible loss that may occur.
837465_14_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.
837465_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The Company is exposed to interest rate risk from its ABL Facility (see Note 4 Financing Arrangements to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_14_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The interest rate applicable to outstanding loans under the ABL Facility fluctuates depending on the Company s trailing 12 month EBITDA (as defined by the ABL Facility) combined with the Company s availability ratio, which is expressed as a percentage of (a) the average daily availability under the ABL Facility to (b) the sum of the Canadian, the U.K. and the U.S. borrowing bases, as adjusted.
837465_14_ITEM7A_P6_S2	All applicable margins can be permanently reduced by 0.25% if EBITDA, as defined in the ABL Facility, meets or exceeds $25.0 million over any trailing twelve-month period, and can be permanently reduced by an additional 0.25% if EBITDA meets or exceeds $50.0 million over any trailing twelve-month period.

837465_14_ITEM15_P35_S0	Warranty Policy The Company has a stated two-year warranty policy for its golf clubs.
837465_14_ITEM15_P35_S1	The Company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded.
837465_14_ITEM15_P35_S2	In estimating its future warranty obligations, the Company considers various relevant factors, including the Company s stated warranty policies and practices, the historical frequency of claims, and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty.
837465_14_ITEM15_P35_S3	The decrease reflected in the table below in the estimated future warranty obligation is primarily due to a decline in warranty return rates primarily due to improved durability of newer products combined with an increase in customer paid repairs.
837465_14_ITEM15_P36_S0	The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to the Company s reserve for warranty expense:
837465_14_ITEM15_P37_S0	Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability (the exit price) in the principal and most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
837465_14_ITEM15_P37_S1	The Company measures and discloses the fair value of nonfinancial and financial assets and liabilities utilizing a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to a fair value measurement are considered to be observable or unobservable in a marketplace.
837465_14_ITEM15_P37_S2	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions.
837465_14_ITEM15_P37_S3	This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.
837465_14_ITEM15_P37_S4	The measurement of assets and liabilities at fair value are classified using the following three-tier hierarchy:
837465_14_ITEM15_P37_S5	Level 1 : Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 : Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and Level 3 :
837465_14_ITEM15_P38_S0	Fair value measurements derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
837465_14_ITEM15_P38_S1	The Company measures fair value using a set of standardized procedures that are outlined herein for all assets and liabilities which are required to be measured at fair value.
837465_14_ITEM15_P38_S2	When available, the Company utilizes quoted market prices from an independent third-party source to determine fair value and classifies such items in Level 1.
837465_14_ITEM15_P38_S3	In some instances where a market price is available, but the instrument is in an inactive or over-the-counter market, the Company consistently applies the dealer (market maker) pricing estimate and uses a midpoint approach on bid and ask prices from financial institutions to determine the reasonableness of these estimates.
837465_14_ITEM15_P38_S4	Assets and liabilities subject to this fair value valuation approach are typically classified as Level 2.
837465_14_ITEM15_P39_S0	Items valued using internally-generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
837465_14_ITEM15_P39_S1	As a result, the asset or liability could be classified in either Level 2 or Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.
837465_14_ITEM15_P40_S0	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow valuation model whenever applicable to derive a fair value measurement on long-lived assets, goodwill and amortizing intangibles.
837465_14_ITEM15_P40_S1	The Company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate.
837465_14_ITEM15_P40_S2	The Company also considers its counterparty s and own credit risk on derivatives and other liabilities measured at their fair value.
837465_14_ITEM15_P41_S0	Advertising Costs The Company advertises primarily through television and print media.
837465_14_ITEM15_P41_S1	The Company s policy is to expense advertising costs, including production costs, as incurred.

837465_14_ITEM15_P43_S0	Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions The Company s foreign subsidiaries utilize their local currency as their functional currency.
837465_14_ITEM15_P43_S1	The accounts of these foreign subsidiaries have been translated into United States dollars using the current exchange rate at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and at the average exchange rate for the period for revenues and expenses.
837465_14_ITEM15_P43_S2	Cumulative translation gains or losses are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity.
837465_14_ITEM15_P44_S0	Gains or losses resulting from transactions that are made in a currency different from the functional currency are recognized in earnings as they occur.
837465_14_ITEM15_P44_S1	The Company recorded a net loss in foreign currency transactions of $821,000 and $3,343,000 in 2013 and 2012, respectively, and net gains of $708,000 in 2011.
837465_14_ITEM15_P45_S0	Derivatives and Hedging The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rates.
837465_14_ITEM15_P45_S1	The derivative instruments are accounted for pursuant to ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, measure those instruments at fair value and recognize changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change unless the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge that offsets certain exposures.
837465_14_ITEM15_P45_S2	As of December 31, 2013, the Company had derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts and put and call option contracts that were not designated as hedging instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815.

837465_14_ITEM15_P46_S1	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments.
837465_14_ITEM15_P46_S2	An estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, the customer s financial condition and current economic trends, all of which are subject to change.
837465_14_ITEM15_P46_S3	Actual uncollected amounts have historically been consistent with the Company s expectations.
837465_14_ITEM15_P46_S4	The increase in the allowance for estimated losses as of December 31, 2013 was primarily due to a large customer that filed for Chapter 11 under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 2013.
837465_14_ITEM15_P46_S5	The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to the Company s allowance for doubtful accounts:
837465_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value.
837465_14_ITEM15_P48_S0	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
837465_14_ITEM15_P49_S0	The inventory balance, which includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs, is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory.
837465_14_ITEM15_P49_S1	The estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon current inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience as well as management s estimates of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand, all of which are subject to change.
837465_14_ITEM15_P50_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
837465_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	Normal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
837465_14_ITEM15_P51_S1	Expenditures that materially increase values, change capacities or extend useful lives are capitalized.
837465_14_ITEM15_P51_S2	The related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income/(loss).
837465_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	Construction in-process consists primarily of costs associated with building improvements, machinery and equipment that have not yet been placed into service, unfinished molds as well as in-process internally developed software.

837465_14_ITEM15_P53_S1	Costs incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed.
837465_14_ITEM15_P53_S2	All direct external costs incurred to develop internal-use software during the development stage are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful lives.
837465_14_ITEM15_P53_S3	Costs such as maintenance and training are expensed as incurred.
837465_14_ITEM15_P54_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-5, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , the Company assesses potential impairments of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying value may not be recoverable.
837465_14_ITEM15_P54_S1	An impairment charge would be recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.
837465_14_ITEM15_P54_S2	The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group.
837465_14_ITEM15_P55_S0	Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets consist of goodwill, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, patents and other intangible assets acquired during the acquisition of Odyssey Sports, Inc. in 1997, FrogTrader, Inc. in 2004, and certain foreign distributors.
837465_14_ITEM15_P55_S1	In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually or when events indicate that an impairment exists.
837465_14_ITEM15_P55_S2	The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets over their estimated fair value.
837465_14_ITEM15_P55_S3	If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded.
837465_14_ITEM15_P55_S4	To determine fair value, the Company uses its internal discounted cash flow estimates, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals when appropriate.
837465_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-5 discussed above.
837465_14_ITEM15_P56_S1	See Note 8 for further discussion of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets.
837465_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	Investments The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of acquisition and reevaluates such classification at each balance sheet date.
837465_14_ITEM15_P57_S1	Investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are stated at cost and are reported in other assets.
837465_14_ITEM15_P57_S2	The Company monitors investments for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 325-35-2, Impairment and ASC Topic 320-35-17 through 35-35, Scope of Impairment Guidance.

837465_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Company accounts for its share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ( ASC Topic 718 ), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and non-employees based on estimated fair values.
837465_14_ITEM15_P58_S1	ASC Topic 718 further requires a reduction in share-based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_14_ITEM15_P59_S0	The forfeiture rate used by the Company is based on historical forfeiture trends.
837465_14_ITEM15_P59_S1	If actual forfeiture rates are not consistent with the Company s estimates, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods.
837465_14_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options and stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) at the date of grant.
837465_14_ITEM15_P60_S1	The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions to calculate the value of stock options/SARs.
837465_14_ITEM15_P60_S2	The Company uses historical data among other information to estimate the expected price volatility, expected term, and forfeiture rate.
837465_14_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Company uses historical dividends to estimate the expected dividend yield.
837465_14_ITEM15_P61_S1	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
837465_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for stock options.
837465_14_ITEM15_P62_S1	Compensation expense for SARs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an estimated fair value, which is remeasured at the end of each reporting period.
837465_14_ITEM15_P62_S2	Once vested, the SARs continue to be remeasured to fair value until they are exercised.
837465_14_ITEM15_P63_S0	The Company records compensation expense for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (collectively restricted stock ) based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
837465_14_ITEM15_P63_S1	The estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the award date multiplied by the number of shares underlying the restricted stock awarded.
837465_14_ITEM15_P63_S2	Total compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
837465_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	Phantom stock units ( PSUs ) are a form of share-based awards that are indexed to the Company s stock and are settled in cash.
837465_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the award s estimated fair value.
837465_14_ITEM15_P65_S1	Fair value is remeasured at the end of each interim reporting period through the award s settlement date and is based on the closing price of the Company s stock.
837465_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	Income Taxes Current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year.
837465_14_ITEM15_P67_S0	A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to ASC Topic 740 and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
837465_14_ITEM15_P67_S1	The Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
837465_14_ITEM15_P67_S2	In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire.
837465_14_ITEM15_P67_S3	These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment, including estimates of future taxable income.
837465_14_ITEM15_P67_S4	These estimates are based on the Company s best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions.
837465_14_ITEM15_P67_S5	In 2011, as a result of this evaluation, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_14_ITEM15_P67_S6	At the end of each interim and annual reporting period, as the U.S. deferred tax assets are adjusted upwards or downwards, the associated valuation allowance and income tax expense are also adjusted.
837465_14_ITEM15_P67_S7	If sufficient positive evidence arises in the future, such as a sustained return to profitability in the U.S. business, any existing valuation allowance could be reversed as appropriate, decreasing income tax expense in the period that such conclusion is reached.
837465_14_ITEM15_P67_S8	The Company concluded that with respect to non-U.S. entities, there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that the realization of its deferred tax assets is deemed to be likely, and no allowances have been established.
837465_14_ITEM15_P67_S9	For further information, see Note 12 Income Taxes.
837465_14_ITEM15_P67_S10	Pursuant to ASC Topic 740-25-6, the Company is required to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is deemed to be more likely than not that the Company would be required to pay such additional taxes.
837465_14_ITEM15_P67_S11	The Company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions.
837465_14_ITEM15_P67_S12	The preparation of these income tax returns requires the Company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by the Company.
837465_14_ITEM15_P67_S13	The Company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability, including interest and penalties in income tax expense, for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return.

837465_14_ITEM15_P74_S3	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, no single customer in the United States represented over 10% of the Company s outstanding accounts receivable balance.
837465_14_ITEM15_P75_S0	Managing customer-related credit risk is more difficult in regions outside of the United States.
837465_14_ITEM15_P75_S1	In 2013, approximately 52% of the Company s net sales were made in regions outside of the United States, compared to approximately 53% in both 2012 and 2011.
837465_14_ITEM15_P75_S2	Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions in the United States or in the Company s international markets could significantly increase the Company s credit risk.
837465_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	From time to time, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and put or call options for the purpose of hedging foreign exchange rate exposures on existing or anticipated transactions.
837465_14_ITEM15_P76_S1	In the event of a failure to honor one of these contracts by one of the banks with which the Company has contracted, management believes any loss would be limited to the exchange rate differential from the time the contract was made until the time it was settled.
837465_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	In 2010, the Company began the implementation of its Global Operations Strategy Initiatives ( GOS Initiatives ), which targeted the restructuring and relocation of the Company s manufacturing and distribution operations.
837465_14_ITEM15_P77_S1	This restructuring, which was designed to add speed and flexibility to customer service demands, optimize efficiencies, and facilitate long-term gross margin improvements, included the reorganization of the Company s manufacturing and distribution centers located in Carlsbad, California, Toronto, Canada, and Chicopee, Massachusetts, the creation of third-party logistics sites in Dallas, Texas and Toronto, Canada, as well as the establishment of a new production facility in Monterrey, Mexico.

837465_14_ITEM15_P115_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent according to the classification of the related asset or liability.
837465_14_ITEM15_P115_S1	Significant components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 are as follows (in thousands):
837465_14_ITEM15_P116_S0	The current year change in net deferred taxes of $1,827,000 is comprised of a net deferred expense of $548,000 related to the change in the basis difference of intangible assets with an indefinite life, a net deferred expense of $1,912,000 related to foreign and separate state jurisdictions for which no valuation allowance has been provided, and a $633,000 benefit related to foreign currency translation adjustments.
837465_14_ITEM15_P117_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are anticipated to be in effect at the time the differences are expected to reverse.
837465_14_ITEM15_P117_S1	The realization of the deferred tax assets, including the loss and credit carry forwards listed above, is subject to the Company generating sufficient taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become realizable.
837465_14_ITEM15_P117_S2	In accordance with the applicable accounting rules, the Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
837465_14_ITEM15_P117_S3	In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire.
837465_14_ITEM15_P118_S0	These estimates are based on the Company s best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions.
837465_14_ITEM15_P119_S0	In 2011, the Company performed an analysis to determine the likelihood that its deferred tax assets relating to its U.S. business would be realized.
837465_14_ITEM15_P119_S1	The Company considered its taxable loss in the U.S. in each of the past three years, the reasons for such loss, the Company s projected financial forecast for its U.S business, and the dates on which the deferred tax assets were expected to expire.
837465_14_ITEM15_P119_S2	This evidence suggested that the Company should establish a valuation allowance.
837465_14_ITEM15_P119_S3	As a result, in 2011, the Company recorded a $52,455,000 increase to income tax expense in order to establish a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets and discontinued recognizing income tax benefits related to its U.S. net operating losses.
837465_14_ITEM15_P119_S4	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the valuation allowance against the Company s U.S. deferred tax assets was $158,159,000 and $151,097,000 , respectively.
837465_14_ITEM15_P119_S5	If sufficient positive evidence arises in the future, such as a sustained return to profitability, any existing valuation allowance could be reversed as appropriate, decreasing income tax expense in the period that such conclusion is reached.
837465_14_ITEM15_P119_S6	The Company has concluded that with respect to non-U.S. entities, there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that realization of its deferred tax assets is more likely than not under applicable accounting rules, and no allowances have been established.
837465_14_ITEM15_P119_S7	The non-cash charge to establish the valuation allowance in 2011 did not have any impact on the Company s consolidated cash flows, nor will such an allowance preclude the Company from using loss carry forwards or other deferred tax assets in the future, except as described below.
837465_14_ITEM15_P119_S8	Until the Company re-establishes a pattern of continuing profitability, in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, U.S. income tax expense or benefit related to the recognition of deferred tax assets in the consolidated statement of operations for future periods will be offset by decreases or increases in the valuation allowance with no net effect on the consolidated statement of operations.
837465_14_ITEM15_P119_S9	At December 31, 2013 , the Company has federal and state income tax credit carryforwards of $7,571,000 and $9,400,000 respectively, which will expire at various dates beginning in 2020 .
837465_14_ITEM15_P119_S10	Such credit carryforwards expire as follows (in thousands):
837465_14_ITEM15_P120_S0	The Company has recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the benefit of operating loss carryforwards.
837465_14_ITEM15_P120_S1	The net operating losses expire as follows (in thousands):

837465_14_ITEM15_P121_S1	The final regulations include standards for determining whether and when a taxpayer must capitalize costs incurred in acquiring, maintaining, or improving tangible property.
837465_14_ITEM15_P121_S2	The final regulations are generally effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, and may be adopted in earlier years under certain circumstances.
837465_14_ITEM15_P121_S3	Proposed regulations were also released that revise the rules for dispositions of tangible property and general asset accounts.
837465_14_ITEM15_P121_S4	The proposed regulations addressing dispositions and general asset accounts are also expected, when finalized, to be effective for tax years starting on or after January 1, 2014, and may be adopted in earlier years under certain circumstances.
837465_14_ITEM15_P121_S5	Based upon preliminary analysis of the final and proposed regulations, the Company expects the regulations will not have a material impact on its operations, financial position, or cash flows.
837465_14_ITEM15_P122_S0	Although the Company has set up a valuation allowance against the majority of its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carry forwards and other losses, such allowance does not preclude the Company from using the deferred tax assets in the future.
837465_14_ITEM15_P122_S1	However, the Company s ability to utilize the losses to offset future taxable income may be deferred or limited significantly if the Company were to experience an ownership change as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
837465_14_ITEM15_P123_S0	The Company determined that no ownership change has occurred for purposes of Section 382 as of December 31, 2013.
837465_14_ITEM15_P124_S0	A reconciliation of the effective tax rate on income or loss and the statutory tax rate is as follows:
837465_14_ITEM15_P125_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):
837465_14_ITEM15_P126_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax benefits was $11,851,000 and can be reduced by $2,773,000 of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, which was recorded as a long-term income tax receivable, as well as $6,496,000 of deferred taxes.
837465_14_ITEM15_P126_S1	The net amount of $2,582,000 , if recognized, would affect the Company s financial statements and favorably affect the Company s effective income tax rate.
837465_14_ITEM15_P126_S2	The Company does expect changes to the unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months; however, the Company does not expect the changes to have a material impact on its results of operations or its financial position.
837465_14_ITEM15_P127_S0	The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
837465_14_ITEM15_P127_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized tax expense of approximately $229,000 , $44,000 and $242,000 , respectively, related to interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes.

837465_14_ITEM15_P129_S1	Upon remittance, certain foreign countries impose withholding taxes that are then available, subject to certain limitations, for use as credits against the Company s U.S. tax liability, if any.
837465_14_ITEM15_P129_S2	If the foreign earnings were remitted, the Company does not anticipate any federal or state income taxes due to the valuation allowance against the Company s U.S. deferred tax assets offset.
837465_14_ITEM15_P129_S3	The Company estimates that it would have withholding taxes of $1,200,000 upon remittance.
837465_14_ITEM15_P130_S0	Commitments and Contingencies Legal Matters The Company is subject to routine legal claims, proceedings, and investigations incident to its business activities, including claims, proceedings, and investigations relating to commercial disputes and employment matters.

837465_14_ITEM15_P130_S2	One or more such claims of potential infringement could lead to litigation, the need to obtain licenses, the need to alter a product to avoid infringement, a settlement or judgment, or some other action or material loss by the Company, which also could adversely affect the Company s overall ability to protect its product designs and ultimately limit its future success in the marketplace.
837465_14_ITEM15_P130_S3	In addition, the Company is occasionally subject to non-routine claims, proceedings, or investigations.
837465_14_ITEM15_P130_S4	The Company regularly assesses such matters to determine the degree of probability that the Company will incur a material loss as a result of such matters as well as the range of possible loss.
837465_14_ITEM15_P131_S0	An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the Company s financial statements if it is probable the Company will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
837465_14_ITEM15_P132_S0	The Company reviews all claims, proceedings, and investigations at least quarterly and establishes or adjusts any accruals for such matters to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.
837465_14_ITEM15_P132_S1	All legal costs associated with such matters are expensed as incurred.
837465_14_ITEM15_P132_S2	Set forth is a description of certain litigation to which the Company is a party: Cleveland Golf Litigation .

837465_14_ITEM15_P133_S1	The Complaint alleges that Callaway s use on its Callaway branded Mack Daddy 2 Wedges of the phrase Designed by Roger Cleveland constitutes trademark infringement (and related claims) of Cleveland Golf s Cleveland trademark.
837465_14_ITEM15_P133_S2	The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages, including punitive damages, costs and attorneys fees, as well as injunctive relief.

837465_14_ITEM15_P135_S2	These matters, including the matter specifically described above, are inherently unpredictable and the resolutions of these matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcomes are not predictable with assurance.
837465_14_ITEM15_P135_S3	Consequently, management is unable to estimate the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary loss, amounts covered by insurance, or the financial impact that will result from such matters.

837465_14_ITEM15_P142_S1	In addition, the Company believes the likelihood is remote that material payments under the commitments and guarantees described above will have a material effect on the Company s financial condition.

837465_14_ITEM15_P153_S3	The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
837465_14_ITEM15_P153_S4	The model uses various assumptions, including a risk-free interest rate, the expected term of the options, the expected stock price volatility, and the expected dividend yield.
837465_14_ITEM15_P154_S0	Compensation expense for employee stock options is recognized over the vesting term and is reduced by an estimate for forfeitures, which is based on the Company s historical forfeitures of unvested options and awards.
837465_14_ITEM15_P154_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011, the weighted average estimated forfeiture rate used was 6.6% , 5.7% and 4.5% , respectively.

837465_14_ITEM15_P156_S3	The expected life of the Company s options is based on evaluations of historical employee exercise behavior, forfeitures, cancellations and other factors.
837465_14_ITEM15_P156_S4	The valuation model applied in this calculation utilizes highly subjective assumptions that could potentially change over time.
837465_14_ITEM15_P156_S5	Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option.
837465_14_ITEM15_P156_S6	Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by the employee holding the option.
837465_14_ITEM15_P156_S7	The following table summarizes the Company s stock option activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 (in thousands, except price per share and contractual term):

837465_14_ITEM15_P173_S1	In addition, in connection with the same initiatives, the Company transitioned its integrated device business to a third-party based model and, as a result, the Company performed an impairment analysis that was based on a discounted cash flow model on the net realizable value of its uPro assets.
837465_14_ITEM15_P173_S2	This analysis resulted in impairment charges of $5,156,000 to write-off amortizing intangibles and goodwill (see Note 8), and $4,345,000 to write-off property, plant and equipment associated with uPro devices (see Note 3).
837465_14_ITEM15_P173_S3	Also in connection with the Cost Reduction Initiatives, during the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company determined that the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of its Top-Flite patents was less than their carrying amount and, as a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $4,572,000 to write-off the net book value of these patents (see Note 8).
837465_14_ITEM15_P174_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company conducted an impairment test on goodwill related to its reporting unit in Australia.

837465_14_ITEM15_P176_S1	(2) Amounts outstanding under the Company's ABL Facility are classified as Level 1 as they approximate the carrying value due to the short term nature of this obligation.
837465_14_ITEM15_P176_S2	(3) Amounts outstanding under standby letters of credit represent the Company s contingent obligation to perform in accordance with the underlying contracts to which they pertain.
837465_14_ITEM15_P176_S3	The fair value of standby letters is classified as Level 1 as it approximates the carrying value due to the short term nature of these obligations.

837465_14_ITEM15_P177_S1	ASC 815 requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, the measurement of those instruments at fair value and the recognition of changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change, unless the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge that offsets certain exposures.
837465_14_ITEM15_P178_S0	and why the Company uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under ASC 815, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the Company s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows.
837465_14_ITEM15_P179_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions of its international subsidiaries, including certain balance sheet exposures (payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies).

837465_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	The Company's golf clubs are also assembled in China, Japan and other local markets based on regional demand for custom clubs.
837465_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , most of the Company s golf club production volume was made in regions outside of the United States.
837465_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	Overall, the golf club assembly process is fairly labor intensive and requires extensive global supply chain coordination and utilizes raw materials that are obtained from suppliers both internationally and within the United States.
837465_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	In February 2013, the Company sold the building housing its golf ball manufacturing operations in Chicopee, Massachusetts and leased back a reduced portion of the square footage to better align with current manufacturing volumes.

837465_15_ITEM1_P17_S4	During each of 2014 and 2013, approximately 60% of the golf ball production volume was manufactured in regions outside of the United States.
837465_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	The overall golf ball manufacturing process utilizes raw materials that are obtained from suppliers both internationally and within the United States and, although a significant amount of labor is used, is much more automated than the golf club assembly process.

837465_15_ITEM1_P22_S2	Sales of the Company s products in the United States are made and supported by full-time regional field representatives and in-house sales and customer service representatives.
837465_15_ITEM1_P22_S3	Most regions in the United States are covered by both a field representative and a dedicated in-house sales representative who work together to initiate and maintain relationships with customers through frequent telephone calls and in-person visits.
837465_15_ITEM1_P22_S4	In addition, other dedicated sales representatives provide service to corporate customers who want their corporate logo imprinted on the Company s golf balls, putters or golf bags.
837465_15_ITEM1_P22_S5	The Company imprints the logos on the majority of these corporate products, thereby retaining control over the quality of the process and final product.
837465_15_ITEM1_P22_S6	The Company also pays a commission to certain on- and off-course professionals and retailers with whom it has a relationship for corporate sales that originate through such professionals and retailers.

837465_15_ITEM1_P33_S5	The Company s second-quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter.
837465_15_ITEM1_P33_S6	The Company s third-quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but are generally less than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season.
837465_15_ITEM1_P33_S7	The Company s fourth-quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company s key markets.
837465_15_ITEM1_P33_S8	However, third-quarter sales can be affected by a mid-year launch of product, and fourth-quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year.
837465_15_ITEM1_P33_S9	This seasonality, and therefore quarter to quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as well as weather conditions.
837465_15_ITEM1_P33_S10	In general, however, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company s sales and most, if not all, of its profitability generally occurs during the first half of the year.

837465_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	This could result in increased delinquent or uncollectible accounts for some of the Company s significant customers.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P3_S4	A failure by the Company s customers to pay on a timely basis a significant portion of outstanding account receivable balances would adversely impact the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P3_S5	The Company has significant international sales and purchases, and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the Company s results of operations.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	A significant portion of the Company s purchases and sales is international, and the Company conducts transactions in various currencies worldwide.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Conducting business in such currencies exposes the Company to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	In addition, the Company s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	As a result, transactions conducted in foreign currencies must be translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes based upon the applicable foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Fluctuations in these foreign currency exchange rates therefore may positively or negatively affect the Company s reported financial results and can significantly affect period-over-period comparisons.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The effect of the translation of foreign currencies on the Company s financial results can be significant.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The Company therefore engages in certain hedging activities to mitigate over time the impact of the translation of foreign currencies on the Company s financial results.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The Company s hedging activities can reduce, but will not eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	The extent to which the Company s hedging activities mitigate the effects of foreign currency translation varies based upon many factors, including the amount of transactions being hedged.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Other factors that could affect the effectiveness of the Company s hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts, volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Since the hedging activities are designed to reduce volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar but also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Company s future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts business.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Foreign currency fluctuations can also affect the prices at which products are sold in the Company s international markets.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The Company therefore adjusts its pricing based in part upon fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Significant unanticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates make it more difficult for the Company to manage pricing in its international markets.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P6_S4	If the Company is unable to adjust its pricing in a timely manner to counteract the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, the Company s pricing may not be competitive in the marketplace and the Company s financial results in its international markets could be adversely affected.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P6_S5	The Company s obligations and certain financial covenants contained under its existing credit facility expose it to risks that could materially and adversely affect its liquidity, business, operating results, financial condition and ability to make any dividend or other payments on its capital stock.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The Company s primary credit facility is a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (as amended, the ABL Facility ), comprised of a U.S. facility, a Canadian facility and a United Kingdom facility, in each case subject to borrowing base availability under the applicable facility.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are secured by certain assets, including cash (to the extent pledged by the Company), inventory and accounts receivable, of the Company s subsidiaries in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	The maximum availability under the ABL Facility fluctuates with the general seasonality of the business, and increases and decreases with the changes in the Company's inventory and account receivable balances.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The ABL Facility includes certain restrictions including, among other things, restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, liens, dividends, stock repurchases and other restricted payments, asset sales, investments, mergers, acquisitions and affiliate transactions.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Additionally, the Company is subject to compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant during, and continuing 30 days after, any period in which the Company s borrowing base availability falls below $23.0 million.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If the Company experiences a decline in revenues or adjusted EBITDA, the Company may have difficulty paying interest and principal amounts due on its ABL Facility or other indebtedness and meeting certain of the financial covenants contained in the ABL Facility.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If the Company is unable to make required payments under the ABL Facility, or if the Company fails to comply with the various covenants and other requirements of the ABL Facility or other indebtedness, the Company would be in default thereunder, which would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate the maturity thereof.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Any default under the ABL Facility or other indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s liquidity, business, operating results and financial condition and ability to make any dividend or other payments on the Company s capital stock.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P8_S5	See Note 4 Financing Arrangements , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the terms of the ABL Facility.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The Company s ability to generate sufficient positive cash flows from operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including future economic trends and conditions, the success of the Company s multi-year turnaround, demand for the Company s products, foreign currency exchange rates and other risks and uncertainties applicable to the Company and its business.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to generate sufficient operating cash flows in the future or maintain or grow its existing cash balances.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows to fund its business due to a further decline in sales or otherwise and is unable to reduce its manufacturing costs and operating expenses to offset such decline, the Company will need to increase its reliance on the ABL Facility for needed liquidity.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If the ABL Facility is not then available or sufficient and the Company is not able to secure alternative financing arrangements, the Company s future operations would be materially, adversely affected.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Unauthorized access to, or accidental disclosure of, consumer personally-identifiable information including credit card information, that the Company collects through its websites may result in significant expenses and negatively impact the Company's reputation and business.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	There is growing concern over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	While the Company has implemented security measures, the Company s computer systems may be susceptible to electronic or physical computer break-ins, viruses and other disruptions and security breaches.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Any perceived or actual unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of personally-identifiable information regarding visitors to the Company s websites or otherwise, whether through a breach of the Company s network by an unauthorized party, employee theft, misuse or error or otherwise, could harm the Company s reputation, impair the Company s ability to attract website visitors, or subject the Company to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by consumers, and adversely affect the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If the Company is unable to successfully manage the frequent introduction of new products that satisfy changing consumer preferences, it could significantly and adversely impact its financial performance and prospects for future growth.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The Company s main products, like those of its competitors, generally have life cycles of two years or less, with sales occurring at a much higher rate in the first year than in the second.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Factors driving these short product life cycles include the rapid introduction of competitive products and consumer demands for the latest technology.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In this marketplace, a substantial portion of the Company s annual revenues is generated each year by products that are in their first year of their product life cycle.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	These marketplace conditions raise a number of issues that the Company must successfully manage.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	For example, the Company must properly anticipate consumer preferences and design products that meet those preferences while also complying with significant restrictions imposed by the Rules of Golf (see further discussion of the Rules of Golf below) or its new products will not achieve sufficient market success to compensate for the usual decline in sales experienced by products already in the market.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Second, the Company s research and development and supply chain groups face constant pressures to design, develop, source and supply new products that perform better than their predecessors many of which incorporate new or otherwise untested technology, suppliers or inputs.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Third, for new products to generate equivalent or greater revenues than their predecessors, they must either maintain the same or higher sales levels with the same or higher pricing, or exceed the performance of their predecessors in one or both of those areas.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Fourth, the relatively short window of opportunity for launching and selling new products requires great precision in forecasting demand and assuring that supplies are ready and delivered during the critical selling periods.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Should the Company not successfully manage the frequent introduction of new products that satisfy consumer demand, the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be significantly adversely affected.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	A reduction in the number of rounds of golf played or in the number of golf participants could adversely affect the Company s sales.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The Company generates substantially all of its revenues from the sale of golf-related products, including golf clubs, golf balls and golf accessories.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The demand for golf-related products in general, and golf balls in particular, is directly related to the number of golf participants and the number of rounds of golf being played by these participants, both of which have declined in recent years.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If golf participation or the number of rounds of golf played continues to decrease, sales of the Company s products may be adversely affected.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	In the future, the overall dollar volume of the market for golf-related products may not grow or may decline.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P14_S4	In addition, the demand for golf products is also directly related to the popularity of magazines, cable channels and other media dedicated to golf, television coverage of golf tournaments and attendance at golf events.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P14_S5	The Company depends on the exposure of its products through advertising and the media or at golf tournaments and events.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Any significant reduction in television coverage of, or attendance at, golf tournaments and events or any significant reduction in the popularity of golf magazines or golf television channels, could reduce the visibility of the Company s brand and could adversely affect the Company s sales.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P14_S7	The Company may have limited opportunities for future growth in sales of golf clubs and golf balls.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P14_S8	In order for the Company to significantly grow its sales of golf clubs or golf balls, the Company must either increase its share of the market for golf clubs or golf balls, or the market for golf clubs or golf balls must grow.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P14_S9	The Company already has a significant share of worldwide sales of golf clubs and golf balls and the golf industry is very competitive.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P14_S10	As such, gaining incremental market share quickly or at all is difficult.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P14_S11	Therefore, opportunities for additional market share may be limited given the challenging competitive nature of the golf industry.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P14_S12	The Company also believes that the worldwide golf market has not grown significantly in recent years.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P14_S13	In the future, the overall dollar volume of worldwide sales of golf clubs or golf balls may not grow or may decline.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P14_S14	If the Company inaccurately forecasts demand for its products, it may manufacture either insufficient or excess quantities, which, in either case, could adversely affect its financial performance.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P14_S15	The Company plans its manufacturing capacity based upon the forecasted demand for its products.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Forecasting the demand for the Company's products is very difficult given the amount of specification involved.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	For example, the Company must forecast not only how many drivers it will sell, but also (1) the quantity of each driver model, (2) the quantity of the different lofts in each driver model, and (3) for each driver model and loft, the number of left handed and right handed versions.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The nature of the Company s business makes it difficult to adjust quickly its manufacturing capacity if actual demand for its products exceeds or is less than forecasted demand.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	If actual demand for its products exceeds the forecasted demand, the Company may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of new products in time to fulfill actual demand, which could limit the Company s sales and adversely affect its financial performance.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	On the other hand, if actual demand is less than the forecasted demand for its products, the Company could produce excess quantities, resulting in excess inventories and related obsolescence charges that could adversely affect the Company s financial performance.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	The Company depends on single source or a limited number of suppliers for some of its products, and the loss of any of these suppliers could harm its business.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Company is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for its clubheads and shafts, some of which are single sourced.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Furthermore, some of the Company s products require specially developed manufacturing techniques and processes which make it difficult to identify and utilize alternative suppliers quickly.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, many of the Company s suppliers are not well capitalized and prolonged unfavorable economic conditions could increase the risk that they will go out of business.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If current suppliers are unable to deliver clubheads, shafts or other components, or if the Company is required to transition to other suppliers, the Company could experience significant production delays or disruption to its business.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P17_S4	The Company also depends on a single or a limited number of suppliers for the materials it uses to make its golf balls.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Many of these materials are customized for the Company.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Any delay or interruption in such supplies could have a material adverse impact upon the Company s golf ball business.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P17_S7	If the Company were able to experience any such delays or interruptions, the Company may not be able to find adequate alternative suppliers at a reasonable cost or without significant disruption to its business.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	A significant disruption in the operations of the Company s golf club assembly and golf ball manufacturing and assembly facilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company s sales, profitability and results of operations.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A significant disruption at any of the Company s golf club or golf ball manufacturing facilities or distribution centers in the United States and in regions outside the United States could materially and adversely affect the Company s sales, profitability and results of operations.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Regulations related to conflict minerals require the Company to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing the Company s products.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In August 2012, the Commission adopted rules requiring disclosure related to sourcing of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The rules require companies to, under specified circumstances, undertake due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The Company s products may contain some of the specified minerals.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	As a result, the Company will incur additional expenses in connection with complying with the rules, including with respect to any due diligence that is required under the rules.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In addition, the implementation of the rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company s products.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P20_S5	There may only be a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free conflict minerals, and the Company cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain necessary conflict free conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Because the Company s supply chain is complex, the Company may also not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in the Company s products through the due diligence procedures that the Company implements, which may harm the Company s reputation.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P20_S7	A disruption in the service or a significant increase in the cost of the Company s primary delivery and shipping services for its products and component parts or a significant disruption at shipping ports could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The Company uses United Parcel Service ( UPS ) for substantially all ground shipments of products to its U.S. customers.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The Company uses air carriers and ocean shipping services for most of its international shipments of products.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Furthermore, many of the components the Company uses to build its golf clubs, including clubheads and shafts, are shipped to the Company via air carrier and ship services.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	If there is any significant interruption in service by such providers or at airports or shipping ports, the Company may be unable to engage alternative suppliers or to receive or ship goods through alternate sites in order to deliver its products or components in a timely and cost-efficient manner.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	As a result, the Company could experience manufacturing delays, increased manufacturing and shipping costs and lost sales as a result of missed delivery deadlines and product demand cycles.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Any significant interruption in UPS services, air carrier services, ship services or at shipping ports could have a material adverse effect upon the Company s business.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Furthermore, if the cost of delivery or shipping services were to increase significantly and the additional costs could not be covered by product pricing, the Company s operating results could be materially adversely affected.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Company faces intense competition in each of its markets and if it is unable to maintain a competitive advantage, loss of market share, revenue, or profitability may result.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The golf club business is highly competitive, and is served by a number of well-established and well-financed companies with recognized brand names.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	New product introductions, price reductions, consignment sales, extended payment terms, closeouts, including closeouts of products that were recently commercially successful, and significant tour and advertising spending by competitors continue to generate intense market competition.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Furthermore, continued downward pressure on pricing in the market for new clubs could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s pre-owned club business as the gap narrows between the cost of a new club and a pre-owned club.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Successful marketing activities, discounted pricing, consignment sales, extended payment terms or new product introductions by competitors could negatively impact the Company s future sales.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The golf ball business is also highly competitive.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	There are a number of well-established and well-financed competitors, including one competitor with an estimated U.S. market share of over 50%.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	The Company s competitors continue to incur significant costs in the areas of advertising, tour and other promotional support.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	The Company believes that to be competitive, the Company also needs to continue to incur significant expenses in tour, advertising and promotional support.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Unless there is a change in competitive conditions, these competitive pressures and increased costs will continue to adversely affect the profitability of the Company s golf ball business.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The Company s accessories include golf bags, golf gloves, golf footwear, golf apparel and other items.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The Company faces significant competition in every region with respect to each of these product categories.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In most cases, the Company is not the market leader with respect to its accessory markets.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S3	The Company s golf club and golf ball business has a concentrated customer base.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S4	The loss of one or more of the Company s top customers could have a significant effect on the Company s golf club and golf ball sales.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S5	On a consolidated basis, no one customer that distributes golf clubs or golf balls in the United States accounted for more than 8% of the Company s consolidated revenues in 2014, 2013 and 2012.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S6	The Company's top five customers accounted for more than 25% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2014, and 23% in 2013 and 25% in 2012.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S7	On a segment basis, in 2014, the Company's top five golf club and golf ball customers accounted for approximately 25% and 30% of the Company s total consolidated golf club and golf ball sales, respectively.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S8	A loss of one or more of these customers could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s golf club and golf ball sales.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S9	International political instability and terrorist activities may decrease demand for the Company s products and disrupt its business.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S10	Terrorist activities and armed conflicts could have an adverse effect upon the United States or worldwide economy and could cause decreased demand for the Company s products as consumers attention and interests are diverted from golf and become focused on issues relating to these events.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S11	If such events disrupt domestic or international air, ground or sea shipments, or the operation of the Company s manufacturing facilities, the Company s ability to obtain the materials necessary to manufacture its products and to deliver customer orders would be harmed, which would have a significant adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S12	Such events can negatively impact tourism, which could adversely affect the Company s sales to retailers at resorts and other vacation destinations.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S13	In addition, the occurrence of political instability and/or terrorist activities generally restricts travel to and from the affected areas, making it more difficult in general to manage the company s international operations.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S14	The Company s business could be harmed by the occurrence of natural disasters or pandemic diseases.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S15	The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, tsunami, fire, flood or hurricane, or the outbreak of a pandemic disease, could significantly adversely affect the Company s business.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S16	A natural disaster or a pandemic disease could significantly adversely affect both the demand for the Company s products as well as the supply of the components used to make the Company s products.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S17	Demand for golf products also could be negatively affected as consumers in the affected regions restrict their recreational activities and as tourism to those areas declines.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S18	If the Company s suppliers experienced a significant disruption in their business as a result of a natural disaster or pandemic disease, the Company s ability to obtain the necessary components to make its products could be significantly adversely affected.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S19	In addition, the occurrence of a natural disaster or the outbreak of a pandemic disease generally restricts travel to and from the affected areas, making it more difficult in general to manage the Company s international operations.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P25_S20	The Company s business and operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could result in fluctuations in its operating results and stock price.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The Company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The Company s first quarter-sales generally represent the Company s sell-in to the golf retail channel of its golf club products for the new golf season.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The Company s second and third-quarter sales generally represent reorder business for golf clubs.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Sales of golf clubs during the second and third quarters are significantly affected not only by the sell-through of the Company s products that were sold into the channel during the first quarter but also by the sell-through of products by the Company s competitors.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Retailers are sometimes reluctant to reorder the Company s products in significant quantities when they already have excess inventory of products of the Company or its competitors.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The Company s sales of golf balls are generally associated with the level of rounds played in the areas where the Company s products are sold.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Therefore, golf ball sales tend to be greater in the second and third quarters, when the weather is good in most of the Company s key markets and the number of rounds played are up.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Golf ball sales are also stimulated by product introductions as the retail channel takes on initial supplies.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Like those of golf clubs, reorders of golf balls depend on the rate of sell-through.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The Company s sales during the fourth quarter are generally significantly less than those of the other quarters because in many of the Company s key regions fewer people are playing golf during that time of year due to cold weather.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Furthermore, the Company generally announces its new product line in the fourth quarter to allow retailers to plan for the new golf season.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	equipment until the Company s new products are available.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Such deferments could have a material adverse effect upon sales of the Company s current products or result in closeout sales at reduced prices.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The seasonality of the Company s business could be exacerbated by the adverse effects of unusual or severe weather conditions as well as by severe weather conditions caused by climate change on the Company s business.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Due to the seasonality of the Company s business, the Company s business can be significantly adversely affected by unusual or severe weather conditions and by severe weather conditions caused by climate change.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Unfavorable weather conditions generally result in fewer golf rounds played, which generally results in reduced demand for all golf products, and in particular, golf balls.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Furthermore, catastrophic storms can negatively affect golf rounds played both during the storms and afterward, as storm damaged golf courses are repaired and golfers focus on repairing the damage to their homes, businesses and communities.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Consequently, sustained adverse weather conditions, especially during the warm weather months, could materially affect the Company s sales.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of the Company s total assets and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact the Company's results of operations and shareholders equity.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P30_S5	The Company s goodwill and intangible assets consist of goodwill from acquisitions, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, patents and other intangible assets.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P30_S6	Accounting rules require the evaluation of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P30_S7	Such indicators include a sustained decline in the Company s stock price or market capitalization, adverse changes in economic or market conditions or prospects, and changes in the Company s operations.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	An asset is considered to be impaired when its carrying value exceeds its fair value.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The Company determines the fair value of an asset based upon the discounted cash flows expected to be realized from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	If in conducting an impairment evaluation the Company determines that the carrying value of an asset exceeded its fair value, the Company would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	If a significant amount of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets were deemed to be impaired, the Company s results of operations and shareholders equity would be significantly adversely affected.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P32_S3	The Company s ability to utilize all or a portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets may be limited significantly if the Company experiences an ownership change.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P32_S4	The Company has a significant amount of U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards and other losses.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P32_S5	The Company s ability to utilize the losses to offset future taxable income may be limited significantly if the Company were to experience an ownership change as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
837465_15_ITEM1A_P32_S6	In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in ownership of the Company s stock by 5-percent shareholders (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P32_S7	The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred for purposes of Section 382 is complex and requires significant judgment.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P32_S8	The extent to which the Company s ability to utilize the losses is limited as a result of such an ownership change depends on many variables, including the value of the Company s stock at the time of the ownership change.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P32_S9	The Company continues to monitor changes in ownership.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P32_S10	If such a cumulative increase did occur in any three year period and the Company were limited in the amount of losses it could use to offset taxable income, the Company s results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P32_S11	Changes in equipment standards under applicable Rules of Golf could adversely affect the Company s business.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P32_S12	The Company seeks to have its new golf club and golf ball products satisfy the standards published by the USGA and The R A in the Rules of Golf because these standards are generally followed by golfers, both professional and amateur, within their respective jurisdictions.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P32_S13	The USGA publishes rules that are generally followed in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and The R A publishes rules that are generally followed in most other countries throughout the world.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P32_S14	However, the Rules of Golf as published by The R A and the USGA are virtually the same and are intended to be so pursuant to a Joint Statement of Principles issued in 2001.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	In the future, existing USGA and/or R A standards may be altered in ways that adversely affect the sales of the Company s current or future products.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	If a change in rules were adopted and caused one or more of the Company s current or future products to be nonconforming, the Company s sales of such products would be adversely affected.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The Company s sales and business could be materially and adversely affected if professional golfers do not endorse or use the Company s products.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The Company establishes relationships with professional golfers in order to evaluate and promote Callaway Golf and Odyssey branded products.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	The Company has entered into endorsement arrangements with members of the various professional tours, including the Champions Tour, the PGA Tour, the LPGA Tour, the PGA European Tour, the Japan Golf Tour and the Web.com Tour.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	While most professional golfers fulfill their contractual obligations, some have been known to stop using a sponsor s products despite contractual commitments.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If certain of the Company s professional endorsers were to stop using the Company s products contrary to their endorsement agreements, the Company s business could be adversely affected in a material way by the negative publicity or lack of endorsement.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The Company believes that professional usage of its golf clubs and golf balls contributes to retail sales.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The Company therefore spends a significant amount of money to secure professional usage of its products.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Many other companies, however, also aggressively seek the patronage of these professionals and offer many inducements, including significant cash incentives and specially designed products.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	There is a great deal of competition to secure the representation of tour professionals.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	As a result, it is expensive to attract and retain such tour professionals.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	The inducements offered by other companies could result in a decrease in usage of the Company s products by professional golfers or limit the Company s ability to attract other tour professionals.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	A decline in the level of professional usage of the Company s products, or a significant increase in the cost to attract or retain endorsers, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s sales and business.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P38_S4	The Company s current senior management team and other key executives are critical to the Company s success, and the loss of, and failure to adequately replace, any such individual could significantly harm the Company s business.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The Company s ability to maintain its competitive position is dependent to a large degree on the efforts and skills of the senior officers of the Company.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The Company s executives are experienced and highly qualified with strong reputations in the golf industry, and the Company believes that its management team enables it to pursue the Company s strategic goals.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P39_S2	In December 2014, the Company announced that Mr. Holiday plans to retire in 2015.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P39_S3	The Company is currently conducting a search for his successor, and Mr. Holiday has agreed to continue as the Company s Chief Financial Officer until his replacement has been identified and a smooth transition has been effected.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The success of the Company s business is dependent upon the management and leadership skills of its senior management team and other key personnel.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Competition for these individuals talents is intense, and the Company may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	A prolonged delay in finding Mr. Holiday's replacement or the loss of one or more of these senior officers could have a material adverse affect upon the Company and its ability to achieve its strategic goals.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Failure to adequately enforce the Company s intellectual property rights could adversely affect its reputation and sales.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The golf club industry, in general, has been characterized by widespread imitation of popular club designs.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The Company has an active program of monitoring, investigating and enforcing its proprietary rights against companies and individuals who market or manufacture counterfeits and knockoff products.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The Company asserts its rights against infringers of its copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade dress.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	However, these efforts may not be successful in reducing sales of golf products by these infringers.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Additionally, other golf club manufacturers may be able to produce successful golf clubs which imitate the Company s designs without infringing any of the Company s copyrights, patents, trademarks or trade dress.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P42_S4	The failure to prevent or limit such infringers or imitators could adversely affect the Company s reputation and sales.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P42_S5	The Company may become subject to intellectual property lawsuits that could cause it to incur significant costs or pay significant damages or that could prohibit it from selling its products.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P42_S6	The Company s competitors also seek to obtain patent, trademark, copyright or other protection of their proprietary rights and designs for golf clubs and golf balls.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P42_S7	From time to time, third parties have claimed or may claim in the future that the Company s products infringe upon their proprietary rights.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P42_S8	The Company evaluates any such claims and, where appropriate, has obtained or sought to obtain licenses or other business arrangements.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P42_S9	To date, there have been no significant interruptions in the Company s business as a result of any claims of infringement.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P42_S10	However, in the future, intellectual property claims could force the Company to alter its existing products or withdraw them from the market or could delay the introduction of new products.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Various patents have been issued to the Company s competitors in the golf industry and these competitors may assert that the Company s golf products infringe their patent or other proprietary rights.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	If the Company s golf products are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights, the Company may be unable to obtain a license to use such technology, and it could incur substantial costs to redesign its products or to defend legal actions.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Recent changes to U.S. patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office could adversely affect the Company s ability to protect its intellectual property.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the Leahy-Smith Act ), which was adopted in September 2011, includes a number of significant changes to the U.S. patent laws, such as, among other things, changing from a first to invent to a first inventor to file system, establishing new procedures for challenging patents and establishing different methods for invalidating patents.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has recently implemented regulations relating to these changes, and the courts have yet to address many of the new provisions of the Leahy-Smith Act.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Some of these changes or potential changes may not be advantageous to the Company, and it may become more difficult to obtain adequate patent protection or to enforce the Company s patents against third parties.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P45_S3	While the Company cannot predict the impact of the Leahy-Smith Act at this time, these changes or potential changes could increase the costs and uncertainties surrounding the prosecution of the Company s patent applications and adversely affect the Company s ability to protect its intellectual property.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The Company s brands may be damaged by the actions of its licensees.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The Company licenses its trademarks to third-party licensees who produce, market and sell their products bearing the Company s trademarks.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	The Company chooses its licensees carefully and imposes upon such licensees various restrictions on the products, and on the manner, on which such trademarks may be used.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P47_S2	In addition, the Company requires its licensees to abide by certain standards of conduct and the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P47_S3	However, if a licensee fails to adhere to these requirements, the Company s brands could be damaged.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P47_S4	The Company s brands could also be damaged if a licensee becomes insolvent or by any negative publicity concerning a licensee or if the licensee does not maintain good relationships with its customers or consumers, many of which are also the Company s customers and consumers.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P47_S5	Sales of the Company s products by unauthorized retailers or distributors could adversely affect the Company s authorized distribution channels and harm the Company s reputation.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P47_S6	Some of the Company s products find their way to unauthorized outlets or distribution channels.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P47_S7	This gray market for the Company s products can undermine authorized retailers and foreign wholesale distributors who promote and support the Company s products, and can injure the Company s image in the minds of its customers and consumers.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P47_S8	On the other hand, stopping such commerce could result in a potential decrease in sales to those customers who are selling the Company s products to unauthorized distributors or an increase in sales returns over historical levels.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P47_S9	While the Company has taken some lawful steps to limit commerce of its products in the gray market in both the United States and abroad, it has not stopped such commerce.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The Company has significant international operations and is exposed to risks associated with doing business globally.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	The Company sells and distributes its products directly in many key international markets in Europe, Asia, North America and elsewhere around the world.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P48_S2	These activities have resulted and will continue to result in investments in inventory, accounts receivable, employees, corporate infrastructure and facilities.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P48_S3	In addition, there are a limited number of suppliers of golf club components in the United States, and the Company has increasingly become more reliant on suppliers and vendors located outside of the United States.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P48_S4	The operation of foreign distribution in the Company s international markets, as well as the management of relationships with international suppliers and vendors, will continue to require the dedication of management and other Company resources.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The Company manufactures most of its products outside of the United States.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P49_S1	As a result of this international business, the Company is exposed to increased risks inherent in conducting business outside of the United States.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In addition to foreign currency risks, these risks include:
837465_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Increased exposure to interruptions in air carrier or ship services.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Any significant adverse change in circumstances or conditions could have a significant adverse effect upon the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the Company's effective income tax rate and profitability.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	The Company's effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-US earnings for which the Company has not previously provided for U.S. taxes.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	The Company regularly assesses all of these matters to determine the adequacy of its tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The Company relies on complex information systems for management of its manufacturing, distribution, sales and other functions.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	If the Company s information systems fail to perform these functions adequately or if the Company experiences an interruption in their operation, including a breach in cyber security, its business and results of operations could suffer.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	All of the Company s major operations, including manufacturing, distribution, sales and accounting, are dependent upon the Company s complex information systems.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The Company s information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:
837465_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Hackers, computer viruses, software bugs or glitches.
837465_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Any damage or significant disruption in the operation of such systems or the failure of the Company s information systems to perform as expected would disrupt the Company s business, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess inventory and product shortages and otherwise adversely affect the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	In February 2013, the Company sold its golf ball manufacturing plant in Chicopee, Massachusetts and leased back approximately 232,000 square feet, which the Company believes is adequate for its ongoing golf ball manufacturing operations at such facility.
837465_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	The lease term for this facility expires in February 2018.
837465_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	The Company also leases a golf club manufacturing facility in Monterrey, Mexico comprised of approximately 180,000 square feet.
837465_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	The lease term for this facility expires in February 2018.
837465_15_ITEM2_P0_S4	In addition, the Company leases a distribution center in Roanoke, Texas comprised of approximately 202,000 square feet.
837465_15_ITEM2_P0_S5	The lease term for this facility expires in September 2020.
837465_15_ITEM2_P0_S6	The Company owns and leases additional properties domestically and internationally, including properties in the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom, China, Thailand and India.
837465_15_ITEM2_P0_S7	The Company s operations at each of these properties includes to some extent activities related to both the golf club and golf ball businesses.
837465_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company believes that its facilities currently are adequate to meet its requirements.
837465_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to liquidity, capital availability and quarterly determinations that cash dividends are in the best interests of its shareholders.
837465_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	Future dividends may be affected by, among other items, the Company s views on potential future capital requirements, projected cash flows and needs, changes to the Company s business model, and certain restrictions limiting dividends imposed by the ABL Facility (see Note 4 Financing Arrangements , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	Performance Graph The following graph presents a comparison of the cumulative total shareholder return of the Company s common stock since December 31, 2009 to two indices: the Standard Poor s 500 Index ( S P 500 ) and the Standard Poor s 600 Smallcap Index ( S P 600 ).
837465_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	The S P 500 tracks the aggregate price performance of equity securities of 500 large-cap companies that are actively traded in the United States, and is considered to be a leading indicator of U.S. equity securities.
837465_15_ITEM5_P1_S2	The S P 600 is a market value-weighted index that tracks the aggregate price performance of equity securities from a broad range of small-cap stocks traded in the United States.
837465_15_ITEM5_P1_S3	The graph assumes an initial investment of $100 at December 31, 2009 and reinvestment of all dividends in ELY stock on the dividend payable date.
837465_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	The Callaway Golf Company cumulative total shareholder return is based upon the closing prices of Callaway Golf Company common stock on December 31, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 of $7.54, $8.07, $5.53, $6.50, $8.43 and $7.70, respectively.
837465_15_ITEM5_P2_S1	In August 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a $50.0 million share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase shares of its common stock in the open market or in private transactions, subject to the Company s assessment of market conditions and buying opportunities.
837465_15_ITEM5_P2_S2	The repurchases will be made consistent with the terms of the Company's credit facility which defines the amount of stock that can be repurchased.
837465_15_ITEM5_P2_S3	The repurchase program will remain in effect until completed or until terminated by the Board of Directors.
837465_15_ITEM5_P2_S4	During 2014, the Company repurchased approximately 133,000 shares of its common stock under the 2014 repurchase program at an average cost per share of $7.62 for a total cost of $1.0 million.
837465_15_ITEM5_P2_S5	There were no share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2014.
837465_15_ITEM5_P2_S6	The Company s repurchases of shares of common stock are recorded at cost and result in a reduction of shareholders equity.
837465_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	(1) On August 29, 2012, the Company issued $112.5 million of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes (the convertible notes ) due August 15, 2019, of which $63.2 million in aggregate principal amount was issued in exchange for 632,270 shares of the Company s then-outstanding 7.50% Series B Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock in separate, privately negotiated exchange transactions, and $49.3 million in aggregate principal amount was issued in private placement transactions for cash (see Note 4 Financing Arrangements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_15_ITEM6_P0_S1	In connection with the convertible notes, the Company recognized interest expense of $5.0 million , $4.9 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012, respectively.
837465_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	(2) The Company s operating statement for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 include pre-tax charges of $16.6 million and $54.1 million, respectively, in connection with the Company's cost-reduction initiatives that were announced in July 2012 (the "Cost Reduction Initiatives").
837465_15_ITEM6_P1_S1	As a result of these initiatives, in 2012, the Company recorded related decreases in working capital and total assets from the impairment of certain intangible assets including goodwill, as well as the write-off of certain long-lived assets and inventory.
837465_15_ITEM6_P1_S2	See Note 3 Restructuring Initiatives , Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets and Note 7 Sale of Buildings in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. (3) During the first quarter of 2012, in an effort to simplify the Company s operations and increase focus on the Company s core Callaway and Odyssey business, the Company sold its Top-Flite and Ben Hogan brands, including trademarks, service marks and certain other intellectual property for net cash proceeds of $26.9 million.
837465_15_ITEM6_P1_S3	The sale of these two brands resulted in a pre-tax net gain of $6.6 million.
837465_15_ITEM6_P1_S4	See Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. (4) The Company s operating statements for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 include pre-tax charges of $1.0 million and $16.3 million, respectively, in connection with workforce reductions related to the reorganization and reinvestment initiatives announced in June 2011.
837465_15_ITEM6_P1_S5	See Note 3 Restructuring Initiatives in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. The operating statement for the year ended December 31, 2010 includes pre-tax charges of $4.0 million in connection with certain workforce reductions announced in 2010.
837465_15_ITEM6_P1_S6	(5) The Company s provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2011 includes $52.5 million of tax expense in order to establish a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets and $21.6 million related to the recognition of certain prepaid tax expenses on intercompany profits.
837465_15_ITEM6_P1_S7	The reduction of deferred tax assets had a corresponding decrease in working capital and total assets, as well as an increase in long-term liabilities.
837465_15_ITEM6_P1_S8	See Note 12 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. (6) In connection with the global operations strategy initiatives that were announced in 2010, the Company s operating statements for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 include pre-tax charges of $24.7 million and $14.8 million, respectively, related to these initiatives.
837465_15_ITEM6_P1_S9	In 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized pre-tax impairment charges of $5.4 million and $7.5 million, respectively, in connection with the write-down of certain trademarks and trade names.
837465_15_ITEM6_P1_S10	Additionally, in 2011, the Company recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $1.1 million in connection with the write-off of goodwill.
837465_15_ITEM6_P1_S11	(8) In March 2011, the Company completed the sale of three of its buildings located in Carlsbad, California.
837465_15_ITEM6_P1_S12	In connection with this sale, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $6.2 million.

837465_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations, financial condition and liquidity are based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
837465_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, shareholders equity, sales and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
837465_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
837465_15_ITEM7_P0_S3	Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
837465_15_ITEM7_P0_S4	On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business and new information as it becomes available.
837465_15_ITEM7_P0_S5	Management believes the critical accounting policies discussed below affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
837465_15_ITEM7_P0_S6	For a complete discussion of all of the Company s significant accounting policies, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized, in general, as products are shipped to customers, net of an allowance for sales returns and accruals for sales programs in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition .
837465_15_ITEM7_P0_S7	In certain cases, the Company recognizes sales when products are received by customers.
837465_15_ITEM7_P0_S8	The Company records a reserve for anticipated returns through a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the period that the related sales are recorded.
837465_15_ITEM7_P0_S9	Sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through of products.
837465_15_ITEM7_P0_S10	In addition, from time to time, the Company offers sales programs that allow for specific returns.
837465_15_ITEM7_P0_S11	The Company records a reserve for anticipated returns related to these sales programs based on the terms of the sales program.
837465_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Historically, the Company s actual sales returns have not been materially different from management s original estimates.
837465_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance for sales returns.
837465_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	However, if the actual costs of sales returns are significantly different than the recorded estimated allowance, the Company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
837465_15_ITEM7_P1_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the recorded estimated allowance for 2014 sales returns, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2014 would have decreased by approximately $0.9 million .
837465_15_ITEM7_P1_S4	The Company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings.
837465_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program, management s forecast of future product demand, and historical customer participation in similar programs.
837465_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Company s primary sales program, the Preferred Retailer Program, offers longer payment terms during the initial sell-in period, as well as potential rebates and discounts, for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the Company, including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels, prime product placement and retailer staff training.
837465_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	Under this program, qualifying retailers can earn either discounts or rebates based upon the amount of product purchased.
837465_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	Discounts are applied and recorded at the time of sale.
837465_15_ITEM7_P3_S3	For rebates, the Company accrues an estimate of the rebate at the time of sale based on the customer s estimated qualifying current year product purchases.
837465_15_ITEM7_P3_S4	The estimate is based on the historical level of purchases, adjusted for any factors expected to affect the current year purchase levels.
837465_15_ITEM7_P3_S5	The estimated year-end rebate is adjusted quarterly based on actual purchase levels, as necessary.
837465_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Preferred Retailer Program is generally short term in nature and the actual costs of the program are known as of the end of the year and paid to customers shortly after year-end.
837465_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	In addition to the Preferred Retailer Program, the Company from time to time offers additional sales program incentive offerings which are also generally short term in nature.
837465_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Historically the Company s actual costs related to its Preferred Retailer Program and other sales programs have not been materially different than its estimates.
837465_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed.
837465_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	In addition, the Company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws.
837465_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	The Company s gift cards have no expiration.
837465_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	To determine when redemption is remote, the Company analyzes an aging of unredeemed cards (based on the date the card was last used or the activation date if the card has never been used) and compares that information with historical redemption trends.
837465_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to determine the timing of recognition of gift card revenues.
837465_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	However, if the Company is not able to accurately determine when gift card redemption is remote, the Company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
837465_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	The deferred revenue associated with outstanding gift cards increased to $1.1 million at December 31, 2014 from $1.0 million at December 31, 2013 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Revenues from course credits in connection with the use of the Company s uPro GPS devices are deferred when purchased and recognized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.
837465_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	Although the Company announced in July 2012 the licensing of its integrated device business to a third-party, the Company maintained services related to course credits used in conjunction with the uPro GPS devices through December 31, 2014.
837465_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	Deferred revenue associated with unused course credits decreased from $1.8 million at December 31, 2013 to $1.4 million at December 31, 2014 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments.
837465_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	An estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, the customer s financial condition and current economic trends, all of which are subject to change.
837465_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	If the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance, the Company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected.
837465_15_ITEM7_P10_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase in uncollectible accounts over the 2014 recorded estimated allowance for doubtful accounts, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2014 would have decreased by approximately $0.6 million .
837465_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value.
837465_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
837465_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	The inventory balance, which includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs, is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory.
837465_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	The estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon current inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience as well as management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand, all of which are subject to change.
837465_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	The calculation of the Company s allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand and pricing, regulatory (USGA and R A) rule changes, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence.
837465_15_ITEM7_P13_S3	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance.
837465_15_ITEM7_P13_S4	However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner, the Company may need to increase its inventory allowance, which could significantly adversely affect the Company s operating results.
837465_15_ITEM7_P13_S5	Assuming there had been a 10% increase in obsolete or unmarketable inventory over the 2014 recorded estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2014 would have decreased by approximately $1.9 million .
837465_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company acquires tangible and intangible assets.
837465_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and amortizing intangible assets, and investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable or exceeds its fair value.
837465_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	The Company evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually or more frequently whenever indicators are present that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.
837465_15_ITEM7_P14_S3	Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining the amount of undiscounted cash flows directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, the timing of the impairment test, and the asset s residual value, if any.
837465_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	To determine fair value, the Company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate.
837465_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the asset and a charge to earnings.
837465_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	The Company uses its best judgment based on current facts and circumstances related to its business when making these estimates.
837465_15_ITEM7_P15_S3	However, if actual results are not consistent with the Company s estimates and assumptions used in calculating future cash flows and asset fair values, the Company may be exposed to losses that could be material.
837465_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	impairment test and fair value analysis of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2014 , and the estimated fair values of the Company s reporting units in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Korea, as well as the estimated fair values of certain trade names and trademarks, exceeded their carrying values.
837465_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	As a result, no impairment was recorded as of December 31, 2014 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	In September 2012, in connection with the Company s Cost Reduction Initiatives that were announced in July 2012, the Company committed to a plan to transition its integrated device business to a third-party licensing model and determined that it would no longer be using or enforcing the trademarks and technology acquired from the uPlay LLC acquisition.
837465_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $5.1 million in 2012 to write-off amortizing intangible assets and goodwill associated with the uPlay, LLC acquisition as these assets were no longer considered recoverable.
837465_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	In addition, the Company wrote-off the net carrying value of long lived assets related to uPro GPS devices, which resulted in a $4.0 million charge to property, plant and equipment as these assets were also not considered recoverable.
837465_15_ITEM7_P17_S3	See Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. In the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recognized impairment charges of $4.6 million in connection with the trade names, trademarks and other intangible assets related to the Top-Flite and Ben Hogan brands.
837465_15_ITEM7_P17_S4	The Company did not perform an impairment analysis on its Top-Flite and Ben Hogan non-amortizing intangibles assets as these assets were sold during the first quarter of 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P17_S5	The impairment charge related to the amortizing intangible assets (i.e. patents) acquired during the Top-Flite and Ben Hogan acquisition.
837465_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company changed its intellectual property strategy as part of its 2012 restructuring initiatives.
837465_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	As part of this new strategy, the Company determined it would no longer be using or enforcing these patents, resulting in a $4.6 million impairment charge as the carrying amount of these assets was no longer considered recoverable.
837465_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	See Note 8 " Goodwill and Intangible Assets " in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Warranty Policy The Company has a stated two-year warranty policy for its golf clubs.
837465_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	The Company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded.
837465_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	In estimating its future warranty obligations, the Company considers various relevant factors, including the Company s stated warranty policies and practices, the historical frequency of claims, and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty.
837465_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	The Company s estimates for calculating the warranty reserve are principally based on assumptions regarding the warranty costs of each club product line over the expected warranty period.
837465_15_ITEM7_P19_S4	Where little or no claims experience may exist, the Company s warranty obligation calculation is based upon long-term historical warranty rates of similar products until sufficient data is available.
837465_15_ITEM7_P19_S5	As actual model-specific rates become available, the Company s estimates are modified to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes.
837465_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Historically, the Company s actual warranty claims have not been materially different from management s original estimated warranty obligation.
837465_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the warranty obligation.
837465_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	However, if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims were to significantly exceed the estimated warranty reserve, the Company may be exposed to losses that could be material.
837465_15_ITEM7_P20_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase in warranty claims over the 2014 recorded estimated allowance for warranty obligations, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2014 would have decreased by approximately $0.6 million .
837465_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Income Taxes Current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year.
837465_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
837465_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	The Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
837465_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire.
837465_15_ITEM7_P22_S3	These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment, including estimates of future taxable income.
837465_15_ITEM7_P22_S4	These estimates are based on the Company s best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions.
837465_15_ITEM7_P22_S5	In 2011, as a result of this evaluation, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	period, as the U.S. deferred tax assets are adjusted upwards or downwards, the associated valuation allowance and income tax expense are also adjusted.
837465_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	If sufficient positive evidence arises in the future, such as a sustained return to profitability in the U.S. business, the valuation allowance could be reversed as appropriate, decreasing income tax expense in the period that such conclusion is reached.
837465_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	The Company has concluded that with respect to non-U.S. entities, there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that the realization of its deferred tax assets is deemed to be likely, and no allowances have been established.
837465_15_ITEM7_P23_S3	In addition, the Company has discontinued recognizing income tax benefits related to its U.S. net operating losses until it is determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefits from its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_15_ITEM7_P23_S4	Pursuant to ASC Topic 740-25-6, the Company is required to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is deemed to be more likely than not that the Company would be required to pay such additional taxes.
837465_15_ITEM7_P23_S5	The Company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions.
837465_15_ITEM7_P23_S6	The preparation of these income tax returns requires the Company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by the Company.
837465_15_ITEM7_P23_S7	The Company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability, including interest and penalties, for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return.
837465_15_ITEM7_P23_S8	The Company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available.
837465_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	Historically, additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the Company s uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the Company s expectations.
837465_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	Information regarding income taxes is contained in Note 12 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Share-based Compensation The Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and non-employees based on estimated fair values.
837465_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	ASC Topic 718 further requires a reduction in share-based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	The forfeiture rate used by the Company is based on historical forfeiture trends.
837465_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	If actual forfeitures are not consistent with the Company s estimates, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods.
837465_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	Performance share units are stock-based awards in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on the Company's performance against specified metrics that are measured over a one-year performance period from the date of grant.
837465_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	These performance metrics are established by the Company at the beginning of the performance period.
837465_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	At the end of the performance period, the number of shares of stock that could be issued is fixed based upon the degree of achievement of the performance goals.
837465_15_ITEM7_P26_S3	The number of shares that could be issued can range from 50% to 150% of the participant's target award.
837465_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Performance share units are initially valued at the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant.
837465_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	Compensation expense for performance share units is recognized over the vesting period and is reduced by an estimate for forfeitures, and will vary based on remeasurements during the performance period.
837465_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	If the performance metrics are not probable of achievement during the performance period, compensation expense would be reversed.
837465_15_ITEM7_P27_S3	The awards are forfeited if the performance metrics are not achieved as of the end of the performance period.
837465_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	The performance units vest in full at the end of a three year period.
837465_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options and stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) at the date of grant.
837465_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the Company s expected stock price volatility, the expected dividend yield, the expected term of an option or SAR and the risk-free interest rate, which is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
837465_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected price volatility and the expected term.
837465_15_ITEM7_P29_S3	The Company uses forecasted dividends to estimate the expected dividend yield.
837465_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option or SAR.
837465_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option or SAR does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee.
837465_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for stock options.
837465_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	Compensation expense for SARs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an award s estimated fair value, which is remeasured at the end of each reporting period.
837465_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	Once vested, SARs continued to be remeasured to fair value until they are exercised.
837465_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	The Company records compensation expense for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (collectively restricted stock ) based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
837465_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares awarded.
837465_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, reduced by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Phantom stock units are a form of share-based awards that are indexed to the Company s stock and are settled in cash.
837465_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	Compensation expense for Phantom Stock Units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the award s estimated fair value.
837465_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	Fair value is remeasured at the end of each interim reporting period through the award s settlement date and is based on the closing price of the Company s stock.
837465_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by this reference.
837465_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Results of Operations Overview of Business, Seasonality and Foreign Currency Products.
837465_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	The Company designs, manufactures and sells high quality golf clubs, golf balls, golf bags and other golf-related accessories.
837465_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	The Company designs its products to be technologically advanced and in this regard invests a considerable amount in research and development each year.
837465_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	The Company s golf products are designed for golfers of all skill levels, both amateur and professional.
837465_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	The Company has two reportable operating segments that are organized on the basis of products, namely the golf clubs segment and golf balls segment.
837465_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	The golf clubs segment consists of Callaway Golf woods, hybrids, irons and wedges and Odyssey putters.
837465_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	This segment also includes other golf-related accessories described above and royalties from licensing of the Company s trademarks and service marks as well as sales of pre-owned golf clubs.
837465_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	The golf balls segment consists of Callaway Golf balls that are designed, manufactured and sold by the Company.
837465_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	As discussed in Note 19 Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, the Company s operating segments exclude a significant amount of corporate general administrative expenses and other income (expense) not utilized by management in determining segment profitability.
837465_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	The Company s cost of sales is comprised primarily of material and component costs, distribution and warehousing costs, and overhead.
837465_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	Due to the recent actions taken in connection with the Cost Reduction Initiatives to improve manufacturing efficiencies, a greater percentage of the Company's manufacturing costs became variable in nature and will fluctuate with sales volumes.
837465_15_ITEM7_P43_S2	With respect to the Company's operating segments, variable costs for golf clubs represent approximately 85% to 95% of cost of sales, and for golf balls, approximately 75% to 85%.
837465_15_ITEM7_P43_S3	Of these variable costs, material and component costs represent approximately 85% to 95% for golf clubs and approximately 75% to 85% for golf balls.
837465_15_ITEM7_P43_S4	On a consolidated basis, over 85% of total cost of sales is variable in nature, and of this amount, over 85% is comprised of material and component costs.
837465_15_ITEM7_P43_S5	Generally, the relative significance of the components of cost of sales does not vary materially from these percentages from period to period.
837465_15_ITEM7_P43_S6	See "Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 - Segment Profitability" and "Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 - "Segment Profitability" below for further discussion of gross margins.
837465_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	In most of the regions where the Company does business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis.
837465_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	Weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year-round, except in a few markets, with many of the Company s on-course customers closing for the cold weather months.
837465_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	The Company s business is therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season.
837465_15_ITEM7_P44_S4	This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter.
837465_15_ITEM7_P44_S5	The Company s second-quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter.
837465_15_ITEM7_P44_S6	The Company s third-quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but are generally less than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season.
837465_15_ITEM7_P44_S7	The Company s fourth-quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company s key markets.
837465_15_ITEM7_P44_S8	However, fourth-quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year.
837465_15_ITEM7_P44_S9	This seasonality, and therefore quarter to quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as well as weather conditions.
837465_15_ITEM7_P44_S10	In general, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company s sales and most, if not all, of its profitability occurs during the first half of the year.
837465_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	A significant portion of the Company s business is conducted outside of the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
837465_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	As a result, changes in foreign currency rates can have a significant effect on the Company s financial results.
837465_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	The Company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates.
837465_15_ITEM7_P45_S3	While these foreign currency exchange contracts can mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates, they do not eliminate those effects, which can be significant.
837465_15_ITEM7_P45_S4	These effects include (i) the translation of results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, (ii) the mark-to-market adjustments of certain intercompany balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies and (iii) the mark-to-market adjustments on the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts.
837465_15_ITEM7_P45_S5	In general, the Company s overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts its business.
837465_15_ITEM7_P45_S6	During 2014, the Company s reported net sales in regions outside the United States were negatively affected by the translation of foreign currency sales into U.S. dollars based on 2014 exchange rates.
837465_15_ITEM7_P45_S7	If 2013 exchange rates were applied to 2014 reported sales in regions outside the United States and all other factors were held constant, net sales in such regions would have been $11.1 million higher than the net sales reported in 2014.
837465_15_ITEM7_P45_S8	Additionally, in general, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts its business, primarily the Japanese Yen.
837465_15_ITEM7_P45_S9	If this trend persists or if the U.S. dollar further strengthens against these currencies, it could significantly adversely impact the Company's future results of operations.
837465_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Executive Summary The Company s net sales for 2014 increased by 5% to $886.9 million as compared to $842.8 million in 2013.
837465_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	Despite softer than expected market conditions, the Company continued to gain market share, driven by growth in sales of woods (8%), irons (12%), golf balls (5%) and accessories and other (2%).
837465_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	Additionally, despite the impact of $11.1 million of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency rates, the Company experienced growth in all geographic segments, including the United States (5%), Japan (3%), Europe (11%), Rest of Asia (7%) and other foreign countries (1%).
837465_15_ITEM7_P46_S3	The Company s gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 310 basis points in 2014 compared to the prior year.
837465_15_ITEM7_P46_S4	These increases were primarily the result of favorable pricing combined with an increase in sales of higher margin products compared to 2013, as well as improved manufacturing and distribution efficiencies resulting from the Company s prior cost-reduction initiatives.
837465_15_ITEM7_P46_S5	In addition, there were no charges related to the cost-reduction initiatives in 2014 compared to charges incurred in 2013 of $11.1 million (see Note 3 "Restructuring Initiatives" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_15_ITEM7_P46_S6	During 2014, the Company continued to manage operating expenses while also increasing its investment in its marketing and tour programs.
837465_15_ITEM7_P46_S7	As a result, operating expenses remained flat in 2014 compared to 2013.
837465_15_ITEM7_P46_S8	Operating expenses in 2013 included charges of $4.7 million related to the Company's cost-reduction initiatives, as well as incremental charges of $5.4 million for bad debt.
837465_15_ITEM7_P46_S9	For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company s other income (expense) decreased by $6.1 million to other expense of $0.1 million compared to other income of $6.0 million in 2013.
837465_15_ITEM7_P46_S10	The decline is primarily attributable to a net decrease in foreign currency contract gains.
837465_15_ITEM7_P46_S11	In 2014, net income improved significantly to $16.0 million compared to a net loss of $18.9 million in 2013 and diluted earnings per share increased to $0.20 compared to a diluted loss per share of $0.31 in 2013.
837465_15_ITEM7_P46_S12	These improvements reflect the Company s continued improvements in market share and operating efficiencies, resulting in its return to profitability for the first time since 2008 - a significant milestone in the Company s turnaround plan.
837465_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $ 44.1 million (5%) to $886.9 million compared to $842.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	This increase was due to increased sales in both the golf club and golf ball operating segments resulting primarily from continued brand momentum and the strong performance of the Big Bertha family of woods, APEX irons, and Speed Regime and Supersoft golf balls launched during 2014, which resulted in market share gains across all product categories.
837465_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	In addition, net sales were positively impacted by a strategic change in product launch timing.
837465_15_ITEM7_P47_S3	These increases were partially offset by challenging market conditions combined with $11.1 million of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency rates.
837465_15_ITEM7_P47_S4	The Company s net sales by operating segment are presented below (dollars in millions):
837465_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	(1) The prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect the Company's current year allocation methodology related to freight revenue and costs, certain discounts and other reserves not specific to a product type.
837465_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	This resulted in an increase of net sales of $1.0 million in the golf clubs segment and a corresponding decrease in net sales in the golf balls segment.
837465_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	For further discussion of each operating segment s results, see Golf Clubs Segment and Golf Balls Segment results below.
837465_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Net sales information by region is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Net sales in the United States increased $20.3 million ( 5% ) to $421.8 million during 2014 compared to $401.5 million in 2013 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	The Company s sales in regions outside of the United States increased $23.8 million (5%) to $465.1 million in 2014 compared to $441.3 million in 2013 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	This overall 5% increase in net sales in all regions was due to the continued improvement in brand momentum as a result of the strong performance of 2014 product introductions, which resulted in market share gains across all product categories primarily in the United States and Europe.
837465_15_ITEM7_P50_S3	This increase was partially offset by continued industry softness as well as the unfavorable impact of the translation of foreign currency sales into U.S. dollars based upon 2014 exchange rates.
837465_15_ITEM7_P50_S4	If 2013 exchange rates were applied to 2014 reported sales in regions outside the United States and all other factors were held constant, net sales in such regions would have been $11.1 million higher than reported during the year ended December 31, 2014 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P50_S5	Gross profit increased $ 43.1 million to $ 357.9 million in 2014 from $ 314.8 million in 2013 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P50_S6	Gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 40.4% in 2014 compared to 37.3% in 2013 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P50_S7	This increase in gross margin was primarily due to (i) a favorable shift in sales mix to higher margin woods, irons and golf balls products in 2014 compared to 2013, combined with an increase in average selling prices of certain woods and irons products in 2014 compared to 2013; (ii) cost savings from improved manufacturing and distribution efficiencies; and (iii) charges incurred in 2013 in connection with the Company's Cost Reduction Initiatives.
837465_15_ITEM7_P50_S8	These improvements were partially offset by (i) an increase in club component costs due to more expensive materials and technology incorporated into certain putters and woods products launched in 2014, and (ii) the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency rates.
837465_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	Selling expenses increased by $7.7 million to $234.2 million ( 26.4% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $226.5 million ( 26.9% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2013 , primarily due to a $6.2 million increase in marketing and tour expenses.
837465_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	General and administrative expenses decreased by $6.4 million to $61.7 million ( 7.0% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $68.1 million ( 8.1% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2013 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	This decrease was primarily due to a $5.4 million decrease in bad debt expense as a result of additional reserves taken in 2013 related to specific accounts, in addition to a $2.2 million decrease in stock compensation expense as a result of a 9% decrease in the Company's stock price in 2014.
837465_15_ITEM7_P51_S3	These decreases were partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in accrued employee bonus and compensation.
837465_15_ITEM7_P51_S4	Research and development expenses increased by $0.4 million to $31.3 million ( 3.5% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $30.9 million ( 3.7% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2013 , primarily due to an increase in employee costs as a result of accrued employee incentive compensation in 2014.
837465_15_ITEM7_P51_S5	Interest expense increased by $0.4 million to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $9.1 million in the comparable period of 2013 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P51_S6	This increase was primarily due to higher average outstanding borrowings in 2014.
837465_15_ITEM7_P51_S7	Other income (expense) decreased by $6.1 million to expense of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to income of $6.0 million in the comparable period of 2013 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P51_S8	This decrease was primarily due to a net decrease in foreign currency contract gains in 2014.
837465_15_ITEM7_P51_S9	The Company s provision for income taxes was flat at $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to the comparable period of 2013 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P51_S10	Due to the effects of the Company s valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets, the Company s effective tax rate for 2014 is not comparable to its effective tax rate for 2013 as the Company s provision for income taxes is not directly correlated to its pretax income for 2014 and pretax loss for 2013.
837465_15_ITEM7_P51_S11	Net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased to $16.0 million compared to a net loss of $18.9 million in the comparable period of 2013 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P51_S12	Diluted earnings per share improved to $0.20 in 2014 compared to a diluted loss per share of $0.31 in 2013 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P51_S13	The Company s net loss for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes $16.6 million related to the Cost Reduction Initiatives.
837465_15_ITEM7_P51_S14	There were no charges related to these initiatives recognized in 2014.
837465_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	Golf Clubs Segment Net sales information for the golf clubs segment by product category is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	(1) The prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect the Company's current year allocation methodology related to freight revenue and costs, certain discounts and other reserves not specific to a product type.
837465_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	This resulted in an increase of net sales of $1.0 million in the golf clubs segment and a corresponding decrease in net sales in the golf balls segment.
837465_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	The $19.7 million ( 8% ) increase in net sales of woods to $269.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from an increase in average selling prices combined with a slight increase in sales volume.
837465_15_ITEM7_P53_S3	The increase in average selling prices was primarily due to the strong performance of the 2014 product line, including the more premium Big Bertha family of woods compared to the same period in the prior year.
837465_15_ITEM7_P53_S4	The $21.4 million ( 12% ) increase in net sales of irons to $200.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in average selling prices due to a favorable shift in product mix due to the success of the more premium APEX and Big Bertha irons during 2014.
837465_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	The $6.7 million ( 8% ) decrease in net sales of putters to $81.1 million for the year December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to a decline in sales volume partially offset by an increase in average selling prices.
837465_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	The decline in sales volume was due to a shift in product launches to more premium models launched in 2014 compared to core (higher volume) putter models launched in 2013.
837465_15_ITEM7_P54_S2	The increase in average selling prices was primarily due to a favorable shift in product mix due to increased sales of the Company's new counterbalanced technology putters (Tank and Tank Cruiser) as well as the introduction of the Company's new elite Metal X Milled putter during 2014, with no comparable elite putter launch in 2013.
837465_15_ITEM7_P54_S3	The $3.8 million ( 2% ) increase in net sales of accessories and other products to $199.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to an increase in net sales of packaged sets and headwear.
837465_15_ITEM7_P54_S4	These increases were partially offset by a decline in apparel and footwear sales primarily due to the transition of the Company's European apparel business to a licensing model at the beginning of 2014.
837465_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	Golf Balls Segment Net sales information for the golf balls segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	(1) The prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect the Company's current year allocation methodology related to freight revenue and costs, certain discounts and other reserves not specific to a product type.
837465_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	This resulted in a decrease of net sales of $1.0 million in the golf balls segment and a corresponding increase in net sales in the golf clubs segment.
837465_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	The $ 5.9 million ( 5% ) increase in net sales of golf balls to $ 137.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to an increase in average selling prices with flat sales volume.
837465_15_ITEM7_P56_S3	The increase in average selling prices resulted from a favorable shift in product mix to sales of higher priced Speed Regime golf balls with no comparable premium ball launch in the prior year.
837465_15_ITEM7_P56_S4	Segment Profitability Profitability by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	(1) The prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect the Company's current year allocation methodology related to freight revenue and costs, certain discounts and other reserves not specific to a product type.
837465_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	This resulted in an increase to income before income taxes of $5.0 million in the golf club segment and a corresponding decrease in income before income taxes in the golf balls segment.
837465_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	(2) Included in the Company s golf clubs and golf balls segments are pre-tax charges of $6.4 million and $7.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013, in connection with the Company's Cost Reduction Initiatives (see Note 3 Restructuring Initiatives in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for details regarding this initiative).
837465_15_ITEM7_P57_S3	(3) Reconciling items represent corporate general and administrative expenses and other income (expense) not included by management in determining segment profitability.
837465_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Net gains of $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 related to foreign currency hedging contracts offset by foreign currency transaction losses.
837465_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	Net gains related to foreign currency were nominal for the year ended December 31, 2014.
837465_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	Pre-tax income in the Company s golf clubs operating segment improved to $50.9 million for 2014 from $32.7 million for 2013.
837465_15_ITEM7_P58_S3	This increase was driven by an increase in net sales as discussed above combined with an increase in gross margin, offset by an increase in operating expenses.
837465_15_ITEM7_P58_S4	The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by (i) a favorable shift in sales mix to the higher margin Big Bertha family of drivers and irons in 2014 compared to the X Hot family of drivers and irons in 2013; (ii) an increase in average selling prices on the X2 Hot family of drivers, fairway woods and irons in 2014 compared to the X Hot golf club products in 2013; (iii) cost savings from improved manufacturing and distribution efficiencies; and (iv) charges incurred in 2013 in connection with the Company's Cost Reduction Initiatives.
837465_15_ITEM7_P58_S5	These increases were partially offset by (i) an increase in club component costs due to more expensive materials and technology incorporated into certain woods and putter products launched in 2014, and (ii) the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency rates year over year.
837465_15_ITEM7_P58_S6	The increase in operating expenses during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in marketing expenses, as discussed above.
837465_15_ITEM7_P58_S7	Pre-tax income in the Company s golf balls operating segment improved to $15.2 million for 2014 from pre-tax loss of $3.4 million for 2013.
837465_15_ITEM7_P58_S8	This increase was attributable to an increase in gross margin as well as an increase in net sales as discussed above, combined with a slight decrease in operating expenses.
837465_15_ITEM7_P58_S9	The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by (i) the launch of the premium Speed Regime golf balls in 2014 with no comparable premium launch in 2013, combined with an increase in average selling prices on value-priced golf balls; and (ii) cost savings from improved manufacturing and distribution efficiencies.
837465_15_ITEM7_P58_S10	These increases were partially offset by the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency rates year over year.
837465_15_ITEM7_P58_S11	Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased $8.7 million (1%) to $842.8 million compared to $834.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P58_S12	This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of woods and irons resulting from the successful performance of the Company s X Hot products which were introduced during 2013.
837465_15_ITEM7_P58_S13	This increase was offset by the sale of the Top-Flite and Ben Hogan brands in 2012 combined with a decline in sales of the Company s accessories and other products due to the transition of the Company s apparel and footwear sales in the United States to a licensing arrangement during the second half of 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P58_S14	Combined, the sale/transition of these businesses negatively affected sales by approximately $57.2 million in 2013 compared to 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P58_S15	Additionally, the Company s net sales in 2013 were negatively impacted by $39.8 million resulting from unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency rates.
837465_15_ITEM7_P58_S16	The Company s net sales by operating segment are presented below (dollars in millions):
837465_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	(1) The prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect the Company's current year allocation methodology related to freight revenue and costs, certain discounts and other reserves not specific to a product type.
837465_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	In each of the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, this resulted in an increase in net sales of $1.0 million in the golf clubs segment and a corresponding decrease in net sales in the golf balls segment.
837465_15_ITEM7_P59_S2	For further discussion of each operating segment s results, see Golf Clubs Segment and Golf Balls Segment results below.
837465_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	Net sales information by region is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	Net sales in the United States increased $9.4 million (2%) to $401.5 million during 2013 compared to $392.1 million in 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	This increase was primarily due to the successful performance of the X Hot products launched in 2013, partially offset by significant decline in sales due to the sale of the Top-Flite and Ben Hogan brands in 2012 combined with a decline in sales of the Company s accessories and other products due to the transition of the Company s apparel and footwear sales in the United States to a licensing arrangement during the second half of 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P61_S2	The Company s sales in regions outside of the United States decreased slightly to $441.3 million in 2013 compared to $442.0 million in 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P61_S3	The Company s reported net sales in regions outside the United States in 2013 were unfavorably affected by the translation of foreign currency sales into U.S. dollars based upon 2012 exchange rates.
837465_15_ITEM7_P61_S4	If 2012 exchange rates were applied to 2013 reported sales in regions outside the United States and all other factors were held constant, net sales in such regions would have been $39.8 million higher than reported during the year ended December 31, 2013.
837465_15_ITEM7_P61_S5	Gross profit increased $66.6 million to $314.8 million in 2013 from $248.2 million in 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P61_S6	Gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 37.3% in 2013 compared to 29.8% in 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P61_S7	This increase in gross margin was primarily due to (i) a favorable shift in sales mix from sales of lower margin golf accessories to increased sales of higher margin golf club products in 2013 compared to 2012; (ii) a decline in charges associated with the Company's Cost Reduction Initiatives; and (iii) improved manufacturing efficiencies resulting from the Cost Reduction Initiatives.
837465_15_ITEM7_P61_S8	These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency rates and an increase in club component costs.
837465_15_ITEM7_P61_S9	Selling expenses decreased by $41.6 million to $226.5 million (26.9% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $268.1 million (32.1% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P61_S10	This decrease was primarily due to the Cost Reduction Initiatives, which resulted in a $21.7 million decline in employee costs, travel and entertainment costs, consulting costs and expenses in connection with the Company's transition of its apparel and footwear businesses in the United States to a licensing arrangement, in addition to a decrease of $14.4 million in marketing expenses.
837465_15_ITEM7_P61_S11	General and administrative expenses increased by $1.3 million to $68.1 million (8.1% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $66.8 million (8.0% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P61_S12	This increase was primarily due to the recognition of a $6.6 million net gain in connection with the sale of the Company s Top-Flite and Ben Hogan brands during the first half of 2012, in addition to a $4.3 million increase in bad debt expense in 2013.
837465_15_ITEM7_P61_S13	These increases were partially offset by the Cost Reduction Initiatives, which resulted in a $5.4 million decline in employee costs, travel and entertainment and expenses in connection with the Company's wind-down of its GPS device business, in addition to a decrease of $4.2 million in professional fees and depreciation and amortization expense.
837465_15_ITEM7_P61_S14	Research and development expenses increased by $1.4 million to $30.9 million (3.7% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $29.5 million (3.5% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2012, primarily due to an increase in employee costs as a result of accrued employee incentive compensation in 2013.
837465_15_ITEM7_P61_S15	Interest expense increased by $3.6 million to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $5.5 million in the comparable period of 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P61_S16	This increase was primarily due to the recognition of a full year of interest and debt discount amortization expense in 2013 in connection with the convertible notes issued in August 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P61_S17	Other income (expense), improved by $2.8 million to income of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to income of $3.2 million in the comparable period of 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P61_S18	This increase in income was primarily attributable to an increase in net foreign currency gains.
837465_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	The Company s provision for income taxes increased to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $4.9 million in the comparable period of 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	The $0.7 million increase resulted from the sale of indefinite lived assets relating to the Top-Flite and Ben Hogan brands in the first quarter of 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	Due to the effects of the Company's valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets, the Company s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 is not comparable to its effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012, as the Company s provision for income taxes is not directly correlated to the amount of its pretax losses.
837465_15_ITEM7_P62_S3	Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased to $18.9 million compared to $122.9 million in the comparable period of 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P62_S4	Diluted loss per share improved to $0.31 in 2013 compared to $1.96 in 2012.

837465_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Golf Clubs Segment Net sales information for the golf clubs segment by product category is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	(1) The prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect the Company's current year allocation methodology related to freight revenue and costs, certain discounts and other reserves not specific to a product type.
837465_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	In each of the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, this resulted in an increase in net sales of $1.0 million in the golf clubs segment and a corresponding decrease in net sales in the golf balls segment.
837465_15_ITEM7_P64_S2	The $51.7 million (26%) increase in net sales of woods to $249.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted from an increase in both sales volume and average selling prices.
837465_15_ITEM7_P64_S3	The increase in sales volume was primarily due to the successful launch of the X Hot family of woods, which performed better at retail than the prior year Razr X family of woods.
837465_15_ITEM7_P64_S4	The increase in average selling prices was due to the introduction of the X Hot and Razr Fit Xtreme woods at higher average selling prices than their predecessors, the Razr X and Razr Fit woods sold in the prior year.
837465_15_ITEM7_P64_S5	The $9.6 million (6%) increase in net sales of irons to $178.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily attributable to the strong performance of the current year X Hot irons and Mack Daddy 2 wedges combined with an increase in average selling prices resulting from less promotional activity in the current year as a result of more optimal inventory levels at retail.
837465_15_ITEM7_P64_S6	The $4.8 million (5%) decrease in net sales of putters to $87.8 million for the year December 31, 2013 was primarily attributable to a decline in both sales volume and average selling prices due to an overall decline in the putter category in 2013.
837465_15_ITEM7_P64_S7	Despite this decline in sales, the Company's Odyssey brand of putters increased its year to date U.S. market share by approximately 200 basis points in 2013.
837465_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	apparel and footwear businesses in the United States to a licensing arrangement during the second half of 2012, combined with a decline in sales of packaged sets, GPS devices, gloves and other accessories.

837465_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	(1) The prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect the Company's current year allocation methodology related to freight revenue and costs, certain discounts and other reserves not specific to a product type.
837465_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	In each of the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, this resulted in a decrease in net sales of $1.0 million in the golf balls segment and a corresponding increase in net sales in the golf clubs segment.
837465_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	The $7.5 million (5%) decrease in net sales of golf balls to $131.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily due to a decline in sales volume and average selling prices.
837465_15_ITEM7_P67_S3	The decrease in sales volume was primarily due to a $19.8 million decline in sales of Top-Flite golf balls due to the sale of the Top-Flite brand in 2012 partially offset by an increase in sales of Callaway Golf balls of $12.3 million during 2013 compared to the prior year.
837465_15_ITEM7_P67_S4	The decline in average selling prices resulted from a shift in product mix to sales of lower priced golf ball models in 2013 compared to sales of higher priced premium golf ball models in 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P67_S5	In addition, golf ball sales in 2013 were negatively impacted by a decline in rounds played compared to rounds played in 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P67_S6	Segment Profitability Profitability by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	(1) prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect the Company's current year allocation methodology related to freight revenue and costs, certain discounts and other reserves not specific to a product type.
837465_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2013, this resulted in an increase to income before income taxes of $5.0 million in the golf clubs segment and a corresponding decrease to income before income taxes in the golf balls segment.
837465_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2012, this resulted in a $0.5 million increase in the loss before income taxes in the golf clubs segment and a corresponding decrease in the loss before income taxes in the golf balls segment.
837465_15_ITEM7_P68_S3	(2) Included in the Company s golf clubs and golf balls segments are the following pre-tax charges: a. $6.4 million and $7.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013, in connection with the Company's Cost Reduction Initiatives; c. $0.8 million and $0.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2012 in connection with the Company s reorganization and reinvestment initiatives that were announced in June 2011.
837465_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	See Note 3 Restructuring Initiatives in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for details regarding the initiatives referenced herein.
837465_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	(3) Reconciling items represent corporate general and administrative expenses and other income (expense) not included by management in determining segment profitability.
837465_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2013, the reconciling items include:
837465_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	Net gains of $5.9 million related to foreign currency hedging contracts offset by foreign currency transaction losses.
837465_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2012, the reconciling items include:
837465_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	Net gains of $3.2 million related to foreign currency hedging contracts offset by foreign currency transaction losses.
837465_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	Pre-tax income in the Company s golf clubs operating segment improved to pre-tax income of $32.7 million for 2013 from a pre-tax loss of $60.3 million for 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	This increase was primarily attributable to a $65.5 million increase in gross margin combined with an increase in net sales as discussed above and a decrease in operating expenses as a result of net savings realized from the Cost Reduction Initiatives.
837465_15_ITEM7_P72_S3	The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by (i) a favorable shift in sales mix from sales of lower margin golf accessories to increased sales of higher margin golf club products primarily related to the success of the X Hot family of clubs; (ii) a decline in charges associated with the Company's Cost Reduction Initiatives; and (iii) improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower costs resulting from the Company's Cost Reduction Initiatives.
837465_15_ITEM7_P72_S4	These increases were partially offset by an increase in club component costs due to more expensive materials and technology incorporated into the X Hot family of woods and White Hot Pro putters, in addition to an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_15_ITEM7_P72_S5	Pre-tax loss in the Company s golf balls operating segment improved to $3.4 million for 2013 from $14.5 million for 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P72_S6	This improvement was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating expenses as a result of net savings realized from the Cost Reduction Initiatives combined with a $1.0 million increase in gross margin, offset by a decrease in net sales primarily due to the sale of the Top-Flite and Ben Hogan Brands, as discussed above.
837465_15_ITEM7_P72_S7	The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by a decline in charges associated with the Company's Cost Reduction Initiatives combined with less promotional activity in 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year.
837465_15_ITEM7_P72_S8	In 2012, the Company had more closeout activity in connection with the sale of the Top-Flite brand.
837465_15_ITEM7_P72_S9	These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable shift in sales mix in 2013 to higher sales of range and value priced golf balls from sales of premium golf balls in 2012.
837465_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	Financial Condition The Company s cash and cash equivalents increased $0.8 million to $37.6 million at December 31, 2014 , from $36.8 million at December 31, 2013 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	Cash generated from operating activities increased by $45.8 million to $36.9 million during 2014 compared to cash used of $8.9 million during 2013 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P73_S2	In 2014, the Company used its cash and cash equivalents as well as cash generated from operations to pay down outstanding borrowings on the ABL Facility, as well as to fund $10.8 million in capital expenditures and $14.8 million in investments in golf-related ventures.
837465_15_ITEM7_P73_S3	The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net income combined with a decline in inventory purchases primarily due to timing.
837465_15_ITEM7_P73_S4	Management expects to fund the Company s future operations from current cash balances and cash provided by its operating activities combined with borrowings under the ABL Facility, as deemed necessary (see Note 4 "Financing Arrangements" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on the ABL Facility).
837465_15_ITEM7_P73_S5	The Company s accounts receivable balance fluctuates throughout the year as a result of the general seasonality of the Company s business.
837465_15_ITEM7_P73_S6	The Company s accounts receivable balance will generally be at its highest during the first and second quarters and decline significantly during the third and fourth quarters as a result of an increase in cash collections and lower sales.
837465_15_ITEM7_P73_S7	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company s net accounts receivable increased $17.6 million to $ 109.8 million from $ 92.2 million as of December 31, 2013 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P73_S8	This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, combined with a decrease in past due receivables.
837465_15_ITEM7_P73_S9	The Company s inventory balance also fluctuates throughout the year as a result of the general seasonality of the Company s business.
837465_15_ITEM7_P73_S10	Generally, the Company s buildup of inventory levels begins during the fourth quarter and continues heavily into the first quarter as well as into the beginning of the second quarter in order to meet demand during the height of the golf season.
837465_15_ITEM7_P73_S11	Inventory levels start to decline toward the end of the second quarter and are at their lowest during the third quarter.
837465_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	levels are also impacted by the timing of new product launches.
837465_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	The Company s inventories decreased $56.3 million to $ 207.2 million as of December 31, 2014 compared to $ 263.5 million as of December 31, 2013 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	This decrease was primarily due to a change in product launch timing year over year, combined with the Company's close-out of its older Razr and Legacy golf products, as well as certain older golf ball products.
837465_15_ITEM7_P74_S3	Inventories as a percentage of the trailing 12 months net sales decreased to 23.4% as of December 31, 2014 compared to 31.3% as of December 31, 2013 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources The information set forth in Note 4 Financing Arrangements , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, is incorporated herein by this reference.
837465_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	Liquidity The Company s principal sources of liquidity consist of its existing cash balances, funds expected to be generated from operations and the ABL Facility.
837465_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	The Company experienced negative cash flows from operations in 2012 and 2013.
837465_15_ITEM7_P76_S2	During the second half of 2012, the Company implemented significant changes to its business, including among other things, steps designed to increase product sales as well as initiatives designed to reduce the Company s manufacturing costs and operating expenses (see Note 3 "Restructuring Initiatives" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's Cost Reduction Initiatives).
837465_15_ITEM7_P76_S3	As a result of these initiatives, in 2014, the Company realized an increase in net sales and gross margin, and improved its cash flows from operations.
837465_15_ITEM7_P76_S4	Based upon the Company s current cash balances, its estimates of funds expected to be generated from operations in 2015, and current and projected availability under the ABL Facility, the Company believes that it will be able to finance current and planned operating requirements, capital expenditures, contractual obligations and commercial commitments for at least the next 12 months.
837465_15_ITEM7_P76_S5	The Company s ability to generate sufficient positive cash flows from operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including future economic trends and conditions, the success of the Company s multi-year turnaround, demand for the Company s products, foreign currency exchange rates, and other risks and uncertainties applicable to the Company and its business (see Risk Factors contained in Part I, Item 1A).
837465_15_ITEM7_P76_S6	While management believes the Company's recovery is on track, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to generate sufficient operating cash flows in the future or maintain or grow its existing cash balances.
837465_15_ITEM7_P76_S7	If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows to fund its business due to a further decline in sales or otherwise and is unable to reduce its manufacturing costs and operating expenses to offset such decline, the Company will need to increase its reliance on the ABL Facility for needed liquidity.
837465_15_ITEM7_P76_S8	If the ABL Facility is not then available or sufficient and the Company could not secure alternative financing arrangements, the Company s future operations would be materially adversely affected.
837465_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , approximately 95% of the Company s total cash is held in regions outside of the United States.
837465_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	If the Company were to repatriate such cash, outside of settling intercompany balances during the normal course of operations, it would need to accrue and pay incremental U.S. federal and state income taxes, reduced by the current amount of available U.S. federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
837465_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	The Company has not, nor does it intend to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with its domestic debt service requirements.
837465_15_ITEM7_P77_S3	As such, the Company considers the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon.
837465_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	In August 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a $50.0 million share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase shares of its common stock in the open market or in private transactions, subject to the Company s assessment of market conditions and buying opportunities.
837465_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	The repurchases will be made consistent with the terms of the Company's credit facility which defines the amount of stock that can be repurchased.
837465_15_ITEM7_P78_S2	The repurchase program will remain in effect until completed or until terminated by the Board of Directors.
837465_15_ITEM7_P78_S3	During 2014, the Company repurchased approximately 133,000 shares of its common stock under the 2014 repurchase program at an average cost per share of $7.62 for a total cost of $1.0 million.
837465_15_ITEM7_P78_S4	The Company s repurchases of shares of common stock are recorded at cost and result in a reduction of shareholders equity.
837465_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	The following table summarizes certain significant cash obligations as of December 31, 2014 that will affect the Company s future liquidity (in millions):
837465_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	(1) In August 2012, the Company issued $112.5 million of convertible notes.
837465_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	Interest of 3.75% per year on the principal amount is payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year.
837465_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	(2) Amounts represent future minimum lease payments.
837465_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	Capital lease obligations are included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
837465_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	(3) The Company leases certain warehouse, distribution and office facilities, vehicles and office equipment under operating leases.
837465_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	The amounts presented in this line item represent commitments for minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases.
837465_15_ITEM7_P82_S2	(4) During the normal course of its business, the Company enters into agreements to purchase goods and services, including purchase commitments for production materials, endorsement agreements with professional golfers and other endorsers, employment and consulting agreements, and intellectual property licensing agreements pursuant to which the Company is required to pay royalty fees.
837465_15_ITEM7_P82_S3	the Company s sales levels, and reductions in payment obligations if designated minimum performance criteria are not achieved.
837465_15_ITEM7_P82_S4	The amounts listed approximate minimum purchase obligations, base compensation and guaranteed minimum royalty payments the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements.
837465_15_ITEM7_P82_S5	The actual amounts paid under some of these agreements may be higher or lower than the amounts included.
837465_15_ITEM7_P82_S6	In the aggregate, the actual amount paid under these obligations is likely to be higher than the amounts listed as a result of the variable nature of these obligations.
837465_15_ITEM7_P82_S7	In addition, the Company also enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders or other documentation or that are undocumented except for an invoice.
837465_15_ITEM7_P82_S8	Such unconditional purchase obligations are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected in this line item.
837465_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	(5) Amount represents the current and non-current portions of uncertain income tax positions as recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 .
837465_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	Amount excludes uncertain income tax positions that the Company would be able to offset against deferred taxes.
837465_15_ITEM7_P83_S2	For further discussion see Note 12 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. (6) Amount represents accrued employee incentive compensation expense earned in 2014, and paid in February 2015.
837465_15_ITEM7_P83_S3	(7) Consists primarily of the deferred gain on the sale of certain buildings in Carlsbad in March 2011 (see Note 7 "Sale of Buildings" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	During its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions.
837465_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	These include (i) intellectual property indemnities to the Company s customers and licensees in connection with the use, sale and/or license of Company products or trademarks, (ii) indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facilities or leases, (iii) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to the goods or services provided to the Company or based on the negligence or willful misconduct of the Company and (iv) indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts.
837465_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	providing for severance payments upon the termination of employment.
837465_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	The Company also has consulting agreements that provide for payment of nominal fees upon the issuance of patents and/or the commercialization of research results.
837465_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	The Company has also issued guarantees in the form of a standby letter of credit in the amount of $ 1.1 million as security for contingent liabilities under certain workers compensation insurance policies.
837465_15_ITEM7_P85_S3	The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases may be indefinite.
837465_15_ITEM7_P85_S4	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be obligated to make.
837465_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	Historically, costs incurred to settle claims related to indemnities have not been material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	In addition, the Company believes the likelihood is remote that payments under the commitments and guarantees described above will have a material effect on the Company s financial condition.
837465_15_ITEM7_P86_S2	The fair value of indemnities, commitments and guarantees that the Company issued during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 was not material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_15_ITEM7_P86_S3	In addition to the contractual obligations listed above, the Company s liquidity could also be adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome with respect to claims and litigation that the Company is subject to from time to time.
837465_15_ITEM7_P86_S4	See Note 13 Commitments Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Capital Resources The Company does not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures.
837465_15_ITEM7_P86_S5	The Company has no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K .
837465_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions of its international subsidiaries, including certain balance sheet exposures (payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies) (see Note 18 Derivatives and Hedging in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	In addition, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from the translation of the operating results of the Company s international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	As part of its strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts and put and call option contracts ( foreign currency exchange contracts ) to mitigate the impact of foreign currency translation on transactions that are denominated primarily in British Pounds, Euros, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Korean Won.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	For most currencies, the Company is a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefits from a weaker U.S. dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which the Company transacts significant amounts of business.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Foreign currency exchange contracts are used only to meet the Company s objectives of offsetting gains and losses from foreign currency exchange exposures with gains and losses from foreign currency contracts in order to reduce foreign currency volatility in earnings.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The extent to which the Company s activities to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates varies is based upon many factors, including the amount of transactions being hedged.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The Company generally only hedges a limited portion of its international transactions.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Foreign currency rates for financial reporting purposes had a negative impact upon the Company s consolidated reported financial results in 2014 compared to 2013 (see Risk Factors contained in Item 1A and Results of Operations contained in Item 7).
837465_15_ITEM7A_P2_S3	The Company does not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for speculative purposes.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P2_S4	Foreign currency exchange contracts generally mature within 12 months from their inception.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	recognized in earnings in the period of change.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Beginning in January 2015, the Company entered into certain foreign currency exchange contracts designated as derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	At December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , the notional amounts of the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts used to hedge the exposures discussed above were approximately $62.9 million , $42.3 million and $137.1 million , respectively.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P4_S2	At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , there were no outstanding foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for anticipated sales denominated in foreign currencies.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	As part of the Company s risk management procedure, a sensitivity analysis model is used to measure the potential loss in future earnings of market-sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates or foreign currency values.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The sensitivity analysis model quantifies the estimated potential effect of unfavorable movements of 10% in foreign currencies to which the Company was exposed at December 31, 2014 through its foreign currency exchange contracts.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The estimated maximum one-day loss from the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts, calculated using the sensitivity analysis model described above, was $6.8 million at December 31, 2014 .
837465_15_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The Company believes that such a hypothetical loss from its foreign currency exchange contracts would be partially offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The sensitivity analysis model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in earnings that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P6_S1	It also does not represent the maximum possible loss that may occur.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The Company is exposed to interest rate risk from its ABL Facility.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility accrue interest as described in Note 4 Financing Arrangements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	As part of the Company s risk management procedures, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of unfavorable changes in interest rates on the Company s cash flows.
837465_15_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The sensitivity analysis quantified that the incremental expense incurred by a 10% increase in interest rates would be $0.3 million over a 12 month period.
837465_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
837465_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act).
837465_15_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 .
837465_15_ITEM9A_P0_S3	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in its report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013).
837465_15_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Based on that assessment, management concluded that as of December 31, 2014 , the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the COSO criteria.
837465_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting .
837465_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014 , there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
837465_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
837465_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
837465_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.

837465_15_ITEM9B_P0_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
837465_15_ITEM9B_P0_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
837465_15_ITEM9B_P0_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
837465_15_ITEM9B_P1_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
837465_15_ITEM9B_P1_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
837465_15_ITEM9B_P1_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
837465_15_ITEM9B_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
837465_15_ITEM9B_P1_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
837465_15_ITEM9B_P1_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 , and our report dated March 3, 2015 , expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

837465_15_ITEM15_P13_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
837465_15_ITEM15_P13_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.
837465_15_ITEM15_P13_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
837465_15_ITEM15_P13_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
837465_15_ITEM15_P14_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
837465_15_ITEM15_P14_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
837465_15_ITEM15_P14_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
837465_15_ITEM15_P14_S3	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Callaway Golf Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

837465_15_ITEM15_P20_S0	CALLAWAY GOLF COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1.
837465_15_ITEM15_P21_S0	The Company Callaway Golf Company ( Callaway Golf or the Company ), a Delaware corporation, together with its subsidiaries, designs, manufactures and sells high quality golf clubs (drivers, fairway woods, hybrids, irons, wedges and putters), golf balls, golf bags and other golf-related accessories.
837465_15_ITEM15_P21_S1	The Company generally sells its products to golf retailers (including pro shops at golf courses and off-course retailers), sporting goods retailers and mass merchants, directly and through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and to third-party distributors in the United States and in over 100 countries around the world.
837465_15_ITEM15_P21_S2	The Company also sells pre-owned Callaway Golf products through its website www.callawaygolfpreowned.com and sells new Callaway Golf products through its websites www.callawaygolf.com and www.odysseygolf.com.
837465_15_ITEM15_P21_S3	In addition, the Company licenses its trademarks and service marks in exchange for a royalty fee to third parties for use on golf related accessories including golf apparel and footwear, golf gloves, umbrellas, prescription eyewear and practice aids.
837465_15_ITEM15_P21_S4	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its domestic and foreign subsidiaries.
837465_15_ITEM15_P21_S5	All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
837465_15_ITEM15_P22_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
837465_15_ITEM15_P22_S1	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
837465_15_ITEM15_P22_S2	Examples of such estimates include provisions for warranty, uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence, sales returns, tax contingencies, estimates on the valuation of share-based awards and recoverability of long-lived assets and investments.
837465_15_ITEM15_P22_S3	Actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
837465_15_ITEM15_P22_S4	On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its estimates to ensure that these estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business or as new information becomes available.
837465_15_ITEM15_P23_S0	This ASU is intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures, and provides guidance to an organization s management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes.
837465_15_ITEM15_P23_S1	Until the issuance of this ASU, U.S. GAAP lacked guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures.
837465_15_ITEM15_P23_S2	The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
837465_15_ITEM15_P23_S3	Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued.
837465_15_ITEM15_P23_S4	The Company does not expect that the adoption of this amendment will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
837465_15_ITEM15_P24_S0	This ASU requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition.
837465_15_ITEM15_P24_S1	The performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award.
837465_15_ITEM15_P24_S2	Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered.
837465_15_ITEM15_P24_S3	If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period.
837465_15_ITEM15_P25_S0	The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest.
837465_15_ITEM15_P25_S1	The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved.
837465_15_ITEM15_P25_S2	This ASU is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
837465_15_ITEM15_P25_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.
837465_15_ITEM15_P26_S0	This ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts).
837465_15_ITEM15_P26_S1	This ASU will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, "Revenue Recognition," and most industry-specific guidance.
837465_15_ITEM15_P26_S2	In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer (e.g., assets within the scope of Topic 360, "Property, Plant, and Equipment," and intangible assets within the scope of Topic 350, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other") are amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement (including the constraint on revenue) in this ASU.
837465_15_ITEM15_P27_S0	The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
837465_15_ITEM15_P27_S1	The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.
837465_15_ITEM15_P27_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.
837465_15_ITEM15_P28_S0	Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized, in general, as products are shipped to customers, net of an allowance for sales returns and sales programs in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.
837465_15_ITEM15_P28_S1	In certain cases, the Company recognizes sales when products are received by customers.
837465_15_ITEM15_P28_S2	The criteria for recognition of revenue are met when persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and both title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
837465_15_ITEM15_P29_S0	Sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through of products.
837465_15_ITEM15_P29_S1	The Company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings.
837465_15_ITEM15_P30_S0	Sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program, management s forecast of future product demand, and historical customer participation in similar programs.
837465_15_ITEM15_P30_S1	The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to the Company s allowance for sales returns:
837465_15_ITEM15_P31_S0	Revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed.
837465_15_ITEM15_P31_S1	In addition, the Company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws.
837465_15_ITEM15_P31_S2	The Company s gift cards have no expiration.
837465_15_ITEM15_P32_S0	To determine when redemption is remote, the Company analyzes an aging of unredeemed cards (based on the date the card was last used or the activation date if the card has never been used) and compares that information with historical redemption trends.

837465_15_ITEM15_P34_S1	The Company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded.
837465_15_ITEM15_P34_S2	In estimating its future warranty obligations, the Company considers various relevant factors, including the Company s stated warranty policies and practices, the historical frequency of claims, and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty.
837465_15_ITEM15_P34_S3	The decrease in the provision for warranty claims is primarily due to a decline in warranty return rates as a result of improved durability of newer products combined with an increase in customer paid repairs.
837465_15_ITEM15_P34_S4	The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to the Company s reserve for warranty expense:
837465_15_ITEM15_P35_S0	Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability (the exit price) in the principal and most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
837465_15_ITEM15_P35_S1	The Company measures and discloses the fair value of nonfinancial and financial assets and liabilities utilizing a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to a fair value measurement are considered to be observable or unobservable in a marketplace.
837465_15_ITEM15_P35_S2	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions.
837465_15_ITEM15_P35_S3	This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.
837465_15_ITEM15_P35_S4	The measurement of assets and liabilities at fair value are classified using the following three-tier hierarchy:
837465_15_ITEM15_P35_S5	Level 1 : Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 : Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and Level 3 :
837465_15_ITEM15_P36_S0	Fair value measurements derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
837465_15_ITEM15_P36_S1	The Company measures fair value using a set of standardized procedures that are outlined herein for all assets and liabilities which are required to be measured at fair value.
837465_15_ITEM15_P36_S2	When available, the Company utilizes quoted market prices from an independent third-party source to determine fair value and classifies such items in Level 1.
837465_15_ITEM15_P36_S3	In some instances where a market price is available, but the instrument is in an inactive or over-the-counter market, the Company consistently applies the dealer (market maker) pricing estimate and uses a midpoint approach on bid and ask prices from financial institutions to determine the reasonableness of these estimates.
837465_15_ITEM15_P36_S4	Assets and liabilities subject to this fair value valuation approach are typically classified as Level 2.
837465_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	Items valued using internally-generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
837465_15_ITEM15_P37_S1	As a result, the asset or liability could be classified in either Level 2 or Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.
837465_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow valuation model whenever applicable to derive a fair value measurement on long-lived assets, goodwill and amortizing intangibles.
837465_15_ITEM15_P38_S1	The Company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate.

837465_15_ITEM15_P41_S0	Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions The Company s foreign subsidiaries utilize their local currency as their functional currency.
837465_15_ITEM15_P41_S1	The accounts of these foreign subsidiaries have been translated into United States dollars using the current exchange rate at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and at the average exchange rate for the period for revenues and expenses.
837465_15_ITEM15_P41_S2	Cumulative translation gains or losses are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity.
837465_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	Gains or losses resulting from transactions that are made in a currency different from the functional currency are recognized in earnings as they occur.
837465_15_ITEM15_P42_S1	The Company recorded a net loss in foreign currency transactions of $6,198,000 , $821,000 and $3,343,000 in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
837465_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	Derivatives and Hedging The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rates.
837465_15_ITEM15_P43_S1	The derivative instruments are accounted for pursuant to ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, measure those instruments at fair value and recognize changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change unless the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge that offsets certain exposures.
837465_15_ITEM15_P43_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company had derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts and put and call option contracts that were not designated as hedging instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815.

837465_15_ITEM15_P44_S2	This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts.
837465_15_ITEM15_P44_S3	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments.
837465_15_ITEM15_P44_S4	An estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, the customer s financial condition and current economic trends, all of which are subject to change.
837465_15_ITEM15_P44_S5	Actual uncollected amounts have historically been consistent with the Company s expectations.
837465_15_ITEM15_P44_S6	The decrease in the allowance for estimated losses as of December 31, 2014 was primarily due to the write-off of uncollectible amounts for a large customer that filed for Chapter 11 under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 2013.
837465_15_ITEM15_P44_S7	The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to the Company s allowance for doubtful accounts:
837465_15_ITEM15_P45_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value.
837465_15_ITEM15_P46_S0	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
837465_15_ITEM15_P47_S0	The inventory balance, which includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs, is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory.
837465_15_ITEM15_P47_S1	The estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon current inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience as well as management s estimates of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand, all of which are subject to change.

837465_15_ITEM15_P49_S2	The related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income/(loss).
837465_15_ITEM15_P50_S0	Construction in-process consists primarily of costs associated with building improvements, machinery and equipment that have not yet been placed into service, unfinished molds as well as in-process internally developed software.
837465_15_ITEM15_P51_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 350-40, Internal-Use Software, the Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal use software.
837465_15_ITEM15_P51_S1	Costs incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed.
837465_15_ITEM15_P51_S2	All direct external costs incurred to develop internal-use software during the development stage are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful lives.
837465_15_ITEM15_P51_S3	Costs such as maintenance and training are expensed as incurred.
837465_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-5, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , the Company assesses potential impairments of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying value may not be recoverable.
837465_15_ITEM15_P52_S1	An impairment charge would be recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.
837465_15_ITEM15_P52_S2	The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group.
837465_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets, which consist of trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, patents and other intangible assets, were acquired in connection with the acquisition of Odyssey Sports, Inc. in 1997, FrogTrader, Inc. in 2004, and certain foreign distributors.
837465_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events indicate that an impairment exists.
837465_15_ITEM15_P54_S1	The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets over their estimated fair value.
837465_15_ITEM15_P54_S2	If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded.
837465_15_ITEM15_P54_S3	To determine fair value, the Company uses its internal discounted cash flow estimates, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals when appropriate.
837465_15_ITEM15_P54_S4	The Company completed its annual impairment test and fair value analysis of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2014 , and the estimated fair values of the Company s reporting units in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Korea, as well as the estimated fair values of certain trade names and trademarks, exceeded their carrying values.
837465_15_ITEM15_P54_S5	As a result, no impairment was recorded as of December 31, 2014 .
837465_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-5 discussed above.

837465_15_ITEM15_P58_S0	The forfeiture rate used by the Company is based on historical forfeiture trends.
837465_15_ITEM15_P58_S1	If actual forfeiture rates are not consistent with the Company s estimates, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods.
837465_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	Performance share units are stock-based awards in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on the Company's performance against specified metrics that are measured over a one -year performance period from the date of grant.
837465_15_ITEM15_P59_S1	These performance metrics are established by the Company at the beginning of the performance period.
837465_15_ITEM15_P59_S2	At the end of the performance period, the number of shares of stock that could be issued is fixed based upon the degree of achievement of the performance goals.
837465_15_ITEM15_P59_S3	The number of shares that could be issued can range from 50% to 150% of the participant's target award.
837465_15_ITEM15_P60_S0	Performance share units are initially valued at the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant.
837465_15_ITEM15_P60_S1	Compensation expense for performance share units is recognized over the vesting period and is reduced by an estimate for forfeitures, and will vary based on remeasurements during the performance period.
837465_15_ITEM15_P60_S2	If the performance metrics are not probable of achievement during the performance period, compensation expense would be reversed.
837465_15_ITEM15_P60_S3	The awards are forfeited if the performance metrics are not achieved as of the end of the performance period.
837465_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	The performance units vest in full at the end of a three year period.
837465_15_ITEM15_P62_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options and stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) at the date of grant.

837465_15_ITEM15_P63_S1	Compensation expense for SARs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an estimated fair value, which is remeasured at the end of each reporting period.
837465_15_ITEM15_P63_S2	Once vested, the SARs continue to be remeasured to fair value until they are exercised.
837465_15_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Company records compensation expense for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (collectively restricted stock ) based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
837465_15_ITEM15_P64_S1	The estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the award date multiplied by the number of shares underlying the restricted stock awarded.
837465_15_ITEM15_P64_S2	Total compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

837465_15_ITEM15_P66_S0	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the award s estimated fair value.
837465_15_ITEM15_P66_S1	Fair value is remeasured at the end of each interim reporting period through the award s settlement date and is based on the closing price of the Company s stock.
837465_15_ITEM15_P67_S0	Income Taxes Current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year.
837465_15_ITEM15_P68_S0	A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to ASC Topic 740 and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
837465_15_ITEM15_P68_S1	The Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
837465_15_ITEM15_P68_S2	In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire.
837465_15_ITEM15_P68_S3	These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment, including estimates of future taxable income.
837465_15_ITEM15_P69_S0	made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions.
837465_15_ITEM15_P69_S1	In 2011, as a result of this evaluation, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_15_ITEM15_P69_S2	At the end of each interim and annual reporting period, as the U.S. deferred tax assets are adjusted upwards or downwards, the associated valuation allowance and income tax expense are also adjusted.
837465_15_ITEM15_P69_S3	If sufficient positive evidence arises in the future, such as a sustained return to profitability in the U.S. business, any existing valuation allowance could be reversed as appropriate, decreasing income tax expense in the period that such conclusion is reached.
837465_15_ITEM15_P69_S4	The Company concluded that with respect to non-U.S. entities, there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that the realization of its deferred tax assets is deemed to be likely, and no allowances have been established.

837465_15_ITEM15_P150_S3	The expected life of the Company s options is based on evaluations of historical employee exercise behavior, forfeitures, cancellations and other factors.
837465_15_ITEM15_P150_S4	The valuation model applied in this calculation utilizes highly subjective assumptions that could potentially change over time.
837465_15_ITEM15_P150_S5	Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option.
837465_15_ITEM15_P150_S6	Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by the employee holding the option.

837465_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	A change in the Company s relationship with significant distributors could negatively impact the volume of the Company s international sales.

837465_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	Conducting business outside of the United States subjects the Company to increased risks inherent in international business.

837465_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	For certain risks associated with competition, see Risk Factors contained in Item 1A.
837465_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	In most of the regions where the Company does business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis.
837465_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	Weather conditions in most parts of the world generally restrict golf from being played year-round, with many of the Company s on-course customers closing during the cold weather months.
837465_16_ITEM1_P33_S2	The Company s business is therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_16_ITEM1_P33_S3	In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season.
837465_16_ITEM1_P33_S4	This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter.
837465_16_ITEM1_P33_S5	The Company s second-quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter.
837465_16_ITEM1_P33_S6	The Company s third-quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but are generally less than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season.
837465_16_ITEM1_P33_S7	The Company s fourth-quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company s key markets.
837465_16_ITEM1_P33_S8	However, third-quarter sales can be affected by a mid-year launch of product, and fourth-quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year.
837465_16_ITEM1_P33_S9	This seasonality, and therefore quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as well as weather conditions.
837465_16_ITEM1_P33_S10	In general, however, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company s sales and most, if not all, of its profitability generally occurs during the first half of the year.
837465_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	The Company s operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of certain materials, substances and wastes and the remediation of environmental contaminants (collectively, Environmental Laws ).
837465_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	In the ordinary course of its manufacturing processes, the Company uses paints, chemical solvents and other materials, and generates waste by-products that are subject to these Environmental Laws.
837465_16_ITEM1_P34_S2	In addition, in connection with the Company's Top-Flite asset acquisition in 2003, the Company assumed certain monitoring and remediation obligations at its manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts.
837465_16_ITEM1_P34_S3	In February 2013, the Company sold this facility and leased back a reduced portion of the square footage that it believes is adequate for its ongoing golf ball manufacturing operations.
837465_16_ITEM1_P34_S4	As part of the terms of this sale, the Company assumed certain ongoing environmental remediation obligations.
837465_16_ITEM1_P34_S5	The Company adheres to all applicable Environmental Laws and takes action as necessary to comply with these laws.
837465_16_ITEM1_P34_S6	The Company maintains an environmental and safety program and employs full-time environmental, health and safety professionals at its facilities located in Carlsbad, California, Chicopee, Massachusetts and Monterrey, Mexico.
837465_16_ITEM1_P34_S7	The environmental and safety program includes obtaining environmental permits as required, capturing and appropriately disposing of any waste by-products, tracking hazardous waste generation and disposal, air emissions, safety situations, material safety data sheet management, storm water management and recycling, and auditing and reporting on its compliance.
837465_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	Historically, the costs of environmental compliance have not had a material adverse effect upon the Company s business.
837465_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	The Company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws.
837465_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	Sustainability The Company believes it is important to conduct its business in an environmentally, economically and socially sustainable manner.
837465_16_ITEM1_P35_S3	In this regard, the Company has an environmental sustainability program which focuses on the reductions of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, reductions of hazardous waste, reductions in water usage, improved recycling and development programs which involve the elimination or reduction of undesirable chemicals and solvents in favor of safer and environmentally preferred alternatives.
837465_16_ITEM1_P35_S4	These efforts cross divisional lines and are visible in the following areas within the Company:
837465_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	Supply chain management through Social, Safety and Environmental Responsibility audits of suppliers.
837465_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	The Company also has two existing programs focusing on the community: the Callaway Golf Company Foundation and the Callaway Golf Company Employee Community Giving Program.
837465_16_ITEM1_P36_S2	Through these programs the Company and its employees are able to give back to the community through monetary donations and by providing community services.
837465_16_ITEM1_P36_S3	Information on both of these programs is available on the Company s website www.callawaygolf.com.

837465_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop, the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Under these circumstances, the trading prices of the Company s securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in the Company s securities.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Unfavorable economic conditions could have a negative impact on consumer discretionary spending and therefore negatively impact the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The Company sells golf clubs, golf balls and golf accessories.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These products are recreational in nature and are therefore discretionary purchases for consumers.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases of golf products during favorable economic conditions and when consumers are feeling confident and prosperous.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Discretionary spending is also affected by many other factors, including general business conditions, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxes and consumer confidence in future economic conditions.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Purchases of the Company s products could decline during periods when disposable income is lower, or during periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P1_S5	A significant or prolonged decline in general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that adversely affect consumer discretionary spending, whether in the United States or in the Company s international markets, could result in reduced sales of the Company s products, which in turn would have a negative impact on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

837465_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	However, a severe or prolonged downturn in the general economy could adversely affect the retail golf equipment market which in turn, would negatively impact the liquidity and cash flows of the Company's customers, including the ability of such customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the Company's products and to pay their trade obligations.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	This could result in increased delinquent or uncollectible accounts for some of the Company s customers.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	A failure by the Company s customers to pay on a timely basis a significant portion of outstanding account receivable balances would adversely impact the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The Company has significant international sales and purchases, and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a significant negative impact on the Company s results of operations.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	A significant portion of the Company s purchases and sales is international, and the Company conducts transactions in various currencies worldwide.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Conducting business in such currencies exposes the Company to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The Company s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, and as a result, transactions conducted in foreign currencies must be translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes based upon the applicable foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Fluctuations in these foreign currency exchange rates therefore may positively or negatively affect the Company s reported financial results and can significantly affect period-over-period comparisons.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The effect of the translation of foreign currencies on the Company s financial results can be significant.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The Company therefore engages in certain hedging activities to mitigate over time the impact of the translation of foreign currencies on the Company s financial results.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The Company s hedging activities can reduce, but will not eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	The extent to which the Company s hedging activities mitigate the effects of foreign currency translation varies based upon many factors, including the amount of transactions being hedged.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Other factors that could affect the effectiveness of the Company s hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts, volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Since the hedging activities are designed to reduce volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar but also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Company s future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts business.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Foreign currency fluctuations can also affect the prices at which products are sold in the Company s international markets.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The Company therefore adjusts its pricing based in part upon fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Significant unanticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates make it more difficult for the Company to manage pricing in its international markets.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P6_S4	If the Company is unable to adjust its pricing in a timely manner to counteract the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, the Company s pricing may not be competitive in the marketplace and the Company s financial results in its international markets could be adversely affected.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P6_S5	The Company s obligations and certain financial covenants contained under its existing credit facilities expose it to risks that could materially and adversely affect its liquidity, business, operating results, financial condition and ability to make any dividend or other payments on its capital stock.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The Company s primary credit facility is a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (as amended, the ABL Facility ), comprised of a U.S. facility, a Canadian facility and a United Kingdom facility, in each case subject to borrowing base availability under the applicable facility.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are secured by certain assets, including cash (to the extent pledged by the Company), inventory and accounts receivable, of the Company s subsidiaries in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	The maximum availability under the ABL Facility fluctuates with the general seasonality of the business, and increases and decreases with the changes in the Company's inventory and account receivable balances.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	The ABL Facility includes certain restrictions including, among other things, restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, liens, dividends, stock repurchases and other restricted payments, asset sales, investments, mergers, acquisitions and affiliate transactions.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Additionally, the Company is subject to compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant during, and continuing 30 days after, any period in which the Company s borrowing base availability falls below $23.0 million.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P7_S5	If the Company experiences a decline in revenues or adjusted EBITDA, the Company may have difficulty paying interest and principal amounts due on its ABL Facility or other indebtedness and meeting certain of the financial covenants contained in the ABL Facility.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P7_S6	If the Company is unable to make required payments under the ABL Facility, or if the Company fails to comply with the various covenants and other requirements of the ABL Facility or other indebtedness, the Company would be in default thereunder, which would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate the maturity thereof.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P7_S7	Any default under the ABL Facility or other indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s liquidity, business, operating results and financial condition and ability to make any dividend or other payments on the Company s capital stock.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P7_S8	See Note 3 Financing Arrangements , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the terms of the ABL Facility.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In January 2015, the Company entered into a separate asset-based loan and guarantee agreement (the "Japan ABL Facility") between its subsidiary in Japan and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFG, Ltd and The Development Bank of Japan.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The Company can borrow up to 2 billion Yen (or $16.6 million, using the exchange rate in effect as of December 31, 2015) under this facility, and the amounts outstanding are secured by certain assets, including eligible inventory.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	As of December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The Company had $15.0 million outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2015, and the maximum amount that could have been outstanding at December 31, 2015 was $16.6 million.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In January 2016, the Company renewed the Japan ABL Facility for an additional two-year term, subject to an effective interest rate equal to TIBOR plus 0.25%.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The agreement expires on January 22, 2018.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Company s ability to generate sufficient positive cash flows from operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including future economic trends and conditions, the success of the Company s multi-year turnaround, demand for the Company s products, foreign currency exchange rates and other risks and uncertainties applicable to the Company and its business.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to generate sufficient operating cash flows in the future or maintain or grow its existing cash balances.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows to fund its business due to a further decline in sales or otherwise and is unable to reduce its manufacturing costs and operating expenses to offset such decline, the Company will need to increase its reliance on its credit facilities for needed liquidity.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If its credit facilities are not then available or sufficient and the Company is not able to secure alternative financing arrangements, the Company s future operations would be materially, adversely affected.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Unauthorized access to, or accidental disclosure of, consumer personally-identifiable information including credit card information, that the Company collects through its websites may result in significant expenses and negatively impact the Company's reputation and business.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	There is growing concern over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	While the Company has implemented security measures, the Company s computer systems may be susceptible to electronic or physical computer break-ins, viruses and other disruptions and security breaches.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Any perceived or actual unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of personally-identifiable information regarding visitors to the Company s websites or otherwise, whether through a breach of the Company s network by an unauthorized party, employee theft, misuse or error or otherwise, could harm the Company s reputation, impair the Company s ability to attract website visitors, or subject the Company to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by consumers, and adversely affect the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If the Company is unable to successfully manage the frequent introduction of new products that satisfy changing consumer preferences, it could significantly and adversely impact its financial performance and prospects for future growth.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The Company s main products, like those of its competitors, generally have life cycles of two years or less, with sales occurring at a much higher rate in the first year than in the second.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Factors driving these short product life cycles include the rapid introduction of competitive products and consumer demands for the latest technology.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	In this marketplace, a substantial portion of the Company s annual revenues is generated each year by products that are in their first year of their product life cycle.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	These marketplace conditions raise a number of issues that the Company must successfully manage.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	For example, the Company must properly anticipate consumer preferences and design products that meet those preferences while also complying with significant restrictions imposed by the Rules of Golf (see further discussion of the Rules of Golf below) or its new products will not achieve sufficient market success to compensate for the usual decline in sales experienced by products already in the market.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Second, the Company s research and development and supply chain groups face constant pressures to design, develop, source and supply new products that perform better than their predecessors many of which incorporate new or otherwise untested technology, suppliers or inputs.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Third, for new products to generate equivalent or greater revenues than their predecessors, they must either maintain the same or higher sales levels with the same or higher pricing, or exceed the performance of their predecessors in one or both of those areas.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Fourth, the relatively short window of opportunity for launching and selling new products requires great precision in forecasting demand and assuring that supplies are ready and delivered during the critical selling periods.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Finally, the rapid changeover in products creates a need to monitor and manage the closeout of older products both at retail and in the Company s own inventory.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P13_S7	Should the Company not successfully manage the frequent introduction of new products that satisfy consumer demand, the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be significantly adversely affected.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P13_S8	A reduction in the number of rounds of golf played or in the number of golf participants could adversely affect the Company s sales.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The Company generates substantially all of its revenues from the sale of golf-related products, including golf clubs, golf balls and golf accessories.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The demand for golf-related products in general, and golf balls in particular, is directly related to the number of golf participants and the number of rounds of golf being played by these participants, both of which have declined in recent years.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In the future, the overall dollar volume of the market for golf-related products may not grow or may decline.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, the demand for golf products is also directly related to the popularity of magazines, cable channels and other media dedicated to golf, television coverage of golf tournaments and attendance at golf events.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The Company depends on the exposure of its products through advertising and the media or at golf tournaments and events.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Any significant reduction in television coverage of, or attendance at, golf tournaments and events or any significant reduction in the popularity of golf magazines or golf television channels, could reduce the visibility of the Company s brand and could adversely affect the Company s sales.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	The Company may have limited opportunities for future growth in sales of golf clubs and golf balls.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P15_S5	In order for the Company to significantly grow its sales of golf clubs or golf balls, the Company must either increase its share of the market for golf clubs or golf balls, or the market for golf clubs or golf balls must grow.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P15_S6	The Company already has a significant share of worldwide sales of golf clubs and golf balls and the golf industry is very competitive.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P15_S7	As such, gaining incremental market share quickly or at all is difficult.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Therefore, opportunities for additional market share may be limited given the challenging competitive nature of the golf industry.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P15_S9	Despite the decline in the worldwide golf market in recent years, the Company believes that the industry is improving and interest in the game is growing.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P15_S10	However, in the future, the overall dollar volume of worldwide sales of golf clubs or golf balls may not grow or may decline.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P15_S11	If the Company inaccurately forecasts demand for its products, it may manufacture either insufficient or excess quantities, which, in either case, could adversely affect its financial performance.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P15_S12	The Company plans its manufacturing capacity based upon the forecasted demand for its products.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P15_S13	Forecasting the demand for the Company's products is very difficult given the manufacturing lead time and the amount of specification involved.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P15_S14	For example, the Company must forecast well in advance not only how many drivers it will sell, but also (1) the quantity of each driver model, (2) the quantity of the different lofts in each driver model, and (3) for each driver model and loft, the number of left handed and right handed versions.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The nature of the Company s business makes it difficult to adjust quickly its manufacturing capacity if actual demand for its products exceeds or is less than forecasted demand.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	If actual demand for its products exceeds the forecasted demand, the Company may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of new products in time to fulfill actual demand, which could limit the Company s sales and adversely affect its financial performance.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	On the other hand, if actual demand is less than the forecasted demand for its products, the Company could produce excess quantities, resulting in excess inventories and related obsolescence charges that could adversely affect the Company s financial performance.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	The Company depends on single source or a limited number of suppliers for some of its products, and the loss of any of these suppliers could harm its business.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Company is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for its clubheads and shafts, some of which are single sourced.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Furthermore, some of the Company s products require specially developed manufacturing techniques and processes which make it difficult to identify and utilize alternative suppliers quickly.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, many of the Company s suppliers are not well capitalized and prolonged unfavorable economic conditions could increase the risk that they will go out of business.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If current suppliers are unable to deliver clubheads, shafts or other components, or if the Company is required to transition to other suppliers, the Company could experience significant production delays or disruption to its business.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P17_S4	The Company also depends on a single or a limited number of suppliers for the materials it uses to make its golf balls.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Many of these materials are customized for the Company.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Any delay or interruption in such supplies could have a material adverse impact upon the Company s golf ball business.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P17_S7	If the Company experiences any such delays or interruptions, the Company may not be able to find adequate alternative suppliers at a reasonable cost or without significant disruption to its business.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P17_S8	A significant disruption in the operations of the Company s golf club assembly and golf ball manufacturing and assembly facilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company s sales, profitability and results of operations.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	A significant disruption at any of the Company s golf club or golf ball manufacturing facilities or distribution centers in the United States and in regions outside the United States could materially and adversely affect the Company s sales, profitability and results of operations.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Regulations related to conflict minerals require the Company to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing the Company s products.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The Commission's rules requires disclosure related to sourcing of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The rules require companies to, under specified circumstances, undertake due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The Company s products may contain some of the specified minerals.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	As a result, the Company will incur additional expenses in connection with complying with the rules, including with respect to any due diligence that is required under the rules.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In addition, the Commission's implementation of the rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company s products.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P20_S5	There may only be a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free conflict minerals, and the Company cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain necessary conflict free conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Because the Company s supply chain is complex, the Company may also not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in the Company s products through the due diligence procedures that the Company implements, which may harm the Company s reputation.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P20_S7	A disruption in the service or a significant increase in the cost of the Company s primary delivery and shipping services for its products and component parts or a significant disruption at shipping ports could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The Company uses United Parcel Service ( UPS ) for substantially all ground shipments of products to its U.S. customers.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The Company uses air carriers and ocean shipping services for most of its international shipments of products.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Furthermore, many of the components the Company uses to build its golf clubs, including clubheads and shafts, are shipped to the Company via air carrier and ship services.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	If there is any significant interruption in service by such providers or at airports or shipping ports, the Company may be unable to engage alternative suppliers or to receive or ship goods through alternate sites in order to deliver its products or components in a timely and cost-efficient manner.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P21_S4	As a result, the Company could experience manufacturing delays, increased manufacturing and shipping costs and lost sales as a result of missed delivery deadlines and product demand cycles.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Any significant interruption in UPS services, air carrier services, ship services or at shipping ports could have a material adverse effect upon the Company s business.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Furthermore, if the cost of delivery or shipping services were to increase significantly and the additional costs could not be covered by product pricing, the Company s operating results could be materially adversely affected.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Company faces intense competition in each of its markets and if it is unable to maintain a competitive advantage, loss of market share, revenue, or profitability may result.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The golf club business is highly competitive, and is served by a number of well-established and well-financed companies with recognized brand names.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	New product introductions, price reductions, consignment sales, extended payment terms, closeouts, including closeouts of products that were recently commercially successful, and significant tour and advertising spending by competitors continue to generate intense market competition.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Furthermore, continued downward pressure on pricing in the market for new clubs could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s pre-owned club business as the gap narrows between the cost of a new club and a pre-owned club.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Successful marketing activities, discounted pricing, consignment sales, extended payment terms or new product introductions by competitors could negatively impact the Company s future sales.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The golf ball business is also highly competitive.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	There are a number of well-established and well-financed competitors, including one competitor with an estimated U.S. market share of over 50%.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	The Company s competitors continue to incur significant costs in the areas of advertising, tour and other promotional support.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P24_S3	The Company believes that to be competitive, the Company also needs to continue to incur significant expenses in tour, advertising and promotional support.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Unless there is a change in competitive conditions, these competitive pressures and increased costs will continue to adversely affect the profitability of the Company s golf ball business.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The Company s accessories include golf bags, golf gloves, golf footwear, golf apparel and other items.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The Company faces significant competition in every region with respect to each of these product categories.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In most cases, the Company is not the market leader with respect to its accessory markets.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	The Company s golf club and golf ball business has a concentrated customer base.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P25_S4	The loss of one or more of the Company s top customers could have a significant effect on the Company s golf club and golf ball sales.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P25_S5	On a consolidated basis, no one customer that distributes golf clubs or golf balls in the United States accounted for more than 9% of the Company s consolidated revenues in 2015, and no one customer accounted for more than 8% of the Company's consolidated revenues in each of 2014 and 2013.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Company's consolidated revenues in 2015, 25% in 2014, and 23% in 2013.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	On a segment basis, the Company's top five golf club customers accounted for approximately 25% of total consolidated golf club sales in each of 2015 and 2014, and approximately 23% in 2013.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The top five golf ball customers accounted for approximately 30% of total consolidated golf ball sales in each of 2015 and 2014, and 27% in 2013.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	A loss of one or more of these customers would have a significant adverse effect on the Company s golf club and golf ball sales.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P26_S4	International political instability and terrorist activities may decrease demand for the Company s products and disrupt its business.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Terrorist activities and armed conflicts could have an adverse effect upon the United States or worldwide economy and could cause decreased demand for the Company s products as consumers attention and interests are diverted from golf and become focused on issues relating to these events.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P26_S6	If such events disrupt domestic or international air, ground or sea shipments, or the operation of the Company s manufacturing facilities, the Company s ability to obtain the materials necessary to manufacture its products and to deliver customer orders would be harmed, which would have a significant adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P26_S7	Such events can negatively impact tourism, which could adversely affect the Company s sales to retailers at resorts and other vacation destinations.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P26_S8	In addition, the occurrence of political instability and/or terrorist activities generally restricts travel to and from the affected areas, making it more difficult in general to manage the company s international operations.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P26_S9	The Company s business could be harmed by the occurrence of natural disasters or pandemic diseases.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P26_S10	The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, tsunami, fire, flood or hurricane, or the outbreak of a pandemic disease, could significantly adversely affect the Company s business.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P26_S11	A natural disaster or a pandemic disease could significantly adversely affect both the demand for the Company s products as well as the supply of the components used to make the Company s products.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P26_S12	Demand for golf products also could be negatively affected as consumers in the affected regions restrict their recreational activities and as tourism to those areas declines.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P26_S13	If the Company s suppliers experienced a significant disruption in their business as a result of a natural disaster or pandemic disease, the Company s ability to obtain the necessary components to make its products could be significantly adversely affected.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P26_S14	In addition, the occurrence of a natural disaster or the outbreak of a pandemic disease generally restricts travel to and from the affected areas, making it more difficult in general to manage the Company s international operations.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P26_S15	The Company s business and operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could result in fluctuations in its operating results and stock price.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The Company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The Company s first quarter-sales generally represent the Company s sell-in to the golf retail channel of its golf club products for the new golf season.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The Company s second and third-quarter sales generally represent reorder business for golf clubs.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Sales of golf clubs during the second and third quarters are significantly affected not only by the sell-through of the Company s products that were sold into the channel during the first quarter but also by the sell-through of products by the Company s competitors.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Retailers are sometimes reluctant to reorder the Company s products in significant quantities when they already have excess inventory of products of the Company or its competitors.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The Company s sales of golf balls are generally associated with the level of rounds played in the areas where the Company s products are sold.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Therefore, golf ball sales tend to be greater in the second and third quarters, when the weather is good in most of the Company s key regions and the number of rounds played are up.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Golf ball sales are also stimulated by product introductions as the retail channel takes on initial supplies.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Like those of golf clubs, reorders of golf balls depend on the rate of sell-through.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The Company s sales during the fourth quarter are generally significantly less than those of the other quarters because in many of the Company s key regions fewer people are playing golf during that time of year due to cold weather.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Furthermore, the Company generally announces its new product line in the fourth quarter to allow retailers to plan for the new golf season.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Such early announcements of new products could cause golfers, and therefore the Company s customers, to defer purchasing additional golf equipment until the Company s new products are available.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Such deferments could have a material adverse effect upon sales of the Company s current products or result in closeout sales at reduced prices.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P29_S5	The seasonality of the Company s business could be exacerbated by the adverse effects of unusual or severe weather conditions as well as by severe weather conditions caused by climate change on the Company s business.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Due to the seasonality of the Company s business, the Company s business can be significantly adversely affected by unusual or severe weather conditions and by severe weather conditions caused by climate change.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Unfavorable weather conditions generally result in fewer golf rounds played, which generally results in reduced demand for all golf products, and in particular, golf balls.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Furthermore, catastrophic storms can negatively affect golf rounds played both during the storms and afterward, as storm damaged golf courses are repaired and golfers focus on repairing the damage to their homes, businesses and communities.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Consequently, sustained adverse weather conditions, especially during the warm weather months, could materially affect the Company s sales.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The Company may be subject to product warranty claims that require the replacement or repair of products sold.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Such warranty claims could adversely affect the Company s results of operations and relationships with its customers.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The Company manufactures and/or distributes a variety of golf-related products and has a stated two-year warranty policy for its golf clubs.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	From time to time, such products may contain manufacturing defects or design flaws that are not detected prior to sale, particularly in the case of new product introductions or upon design changes to existing products.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The failure to identify and correct manufacturing defects and product design issues prior to the sale of those products could result in product warranty claims that result in costs to replace or repair any such defective products.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Because many of the Company s products are sold to retailers for broad consumer distribution and/or to customers who buy in large quantities, there could be significant costs associated with such product warranty claims, including the potential for customer dissatisfaction that may adversely affect the Company s reputation and relationships with its customers, which may result in lost or reduced sales.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of the Company s total assets and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact the Company's results of operations and shareholders equity.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P33_S5	The Company s goodwill and intangible assets consist of goodwill from acquisitions, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, patents and other intangible assets.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P33_S6	Accounting rules require the evaluation of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P33_S7	Such indicators include a sustained decline in the Company s stock price or market capitalization, adverse changes in economic or market conditions or prospects, and changes in the Company s operations.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	An asset is considered to be impaired when its carrying value exceeds its fair value.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The Company determines the fair value of an asset based upon the discounted cash flows expected to be realized from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	If in conducting an impairment evaluation the Company determines that the carrying value of an asset exceeded its fair value, the Company would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If a significant amount of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets were deemed to be impaired, the Company s results of operations and shareholders equity would be significantly adversely affected.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P35_S3	The Company s ability to utilize all or a portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets may be limited significantly if the Company experiences an ownership change.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P35_S4	The Company has a significant amount of U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards, other losses and credit carryforwards.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P35_S5	The Company s ability to utilize the losses and credits to offset future taxable income may be limited significantly if the Company were to experience an ownership change as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
837465_16_ITEM1A_P35_S6	In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in ownership of the Company s stock by 5-percent shareholders (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P35_S7	The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred for purposes of Section 382 is complex and requires significant judgment.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P35_S8	The extent to which the Company s ability to utilize the losses and credits is limited as a result of such an ownership change depends on many variables, including the value of the Company s stock at the time of the ownership change.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P35_S9	The Company continues to monitor changes in ownership.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P35_S10	If such a cumulative increase did occur in any three year period and the Company were limited in the amount of losses and credits it could use to offset taxable income, the Company s results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P35_S11	Changes in equipment standards under applicable Rules of Golf could adversely affect the Company s business.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P35_S12	The Company seeks to have its new golf club and golf ball products satisfy the standards published by the USGA and The R A in the Rules of Golf because these standards are generally followed by golfers, both professional and amateur, within their respective jurisdictions.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P35_S13	The USGA publishes rules that are generally followed in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and The R A publishes rules that are generally followed in most other countries throughout the world.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P35_S14	However, the Rules of Golf as published by The R A and the USGA are virtually the same and are intended to be so pursuant to a Joint Statement of Principles issued in 2001.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In the future, existing USGA and/or R A standards may be altered in ways that adversely affect the sales of the Company s current or future products.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If a change in rules were adopted and caused one or more of the Company s current or future products to be nonconforming, the Company s sales of such products would be adversely affected.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	The Company s sales and business could be materially and adversely affected if professional golfers do not endorse or use the Company s products.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The Company establishes relationships with professional golfers in order to evaluate and promote Callaway Golf and Odyssey branded products.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The Company has entered into endorsement arrangements with members of the various professional tours, including the Champions Tour, the PGA Tour, the LPGA Tour, the PGA European Tour, the Japan Golf Tour and the Web.com Tour.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	While most professional golfers fulfill their contractual obligations, some have been known to stop using a sponsor s products despite contractual commitments.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If certain of the Company s professional endorsers were to stop using the Company s products contrary to their endorsement agreements, the Company s business could be adversely affected in a material way by the negative publicity or lack of endorsement.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The Company believes that professional usage of its golf clubs and golf balls contributes to retail sales.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The Company therefore spends a significant amount of money to secure professional usage of its products.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Many other companies, however, also aggressively seek the patronage of these professionals and offer many inducements, including significant cash incentives and specially designed products.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	There is a great deal of competition to secure the representation of tour professionals.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	As a result, it is expensive to attract and retain such tour professionals.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	The inducements offered by other companies could result in a decrease in usage of the Company s products by professional golfers or limit the Company s ability to attract other tour professionals.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	A decline in the level of professional usage of the Company s products, or a significant increase in the cost to attract or retain endorsers, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s sales and business.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P40_S4	The Company s current senior management team and other key executives are critical to the Company s success, and the loss of, and failure to adequately replace, any such individual could significantly harm the Company s business.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The Company s ability to maintain its competitive position is dependent to a large degree on the efforts and skills of the senior officers of the Company.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The Company s executives are experienced and highly qualified with strong reputations in the golf industry, and the Company believes that its management team enables it to pursue the Company s strategic goals.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P41_S2	The success of the Company s business is dependent upon the management and leadership skills of its senior management team and other key personnel.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Competition for these individuals talents is intense, and the Company may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P41_S4	The loss of one or more of these senior officers could have a material adverse effect upon the Company and its ability to achieve its strategic goals.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Failure to adequately enforce the Company s intellectual property rights could adversely affect its reputation and sales.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The golf club industry, in general, has been characterized by widespread imitation of popular club designs.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The Company has an active program of monitoring, investigating and enforcing its proprietary rights against companies and individuals who market or manufacture counterfeits and knockoff products.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The Company asserts its rights against infringers of its copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade dress.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P43_S2	However, these efforts may not be successful in reducing sales of golf products by these infringers.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Additionally, other golf club manufacturers may be able to produce successful golf clubs which imitate the Company s designs without infringing any of the Company s copyrights, patents, trademarks or trade dress.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P43_S4	The failure to prevent or limit such infringers or imitators could adversely affect the Company s reputation and sales.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P43_S5	The Company may become subject to intellectual property lawsuits that could cause it to incur significant costs or pay significant damages or that could prohibit it from selling its products.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P43_S6	The Company s competitors also seek to obtain patent, trademark, copyright or other protection of their proprietary rights and designs for golf clubs, golf balls and other golf products.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P43_S7	From time to time, third parties have claimed or may claim in the future that the Company s products infringe upon their proprietary rights.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P43_S8	The Company evaluates any such claims and, where appropriate, has obtained or sought to obtain licenses or other business arrangements.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P43_S9	To date, there have been no significant interruptions in the Company s business as a result of any claims of infringement.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P43_S10	However, in the future, intellectual property claims could force the Company to alter its existing products or withdraw them from the market or could delay the introduction of new products.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Various patents have been issued to the Company s competitors in the golf industry and these competitors may assert that the Company s golf products infringe their patent or other proprietary rights.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	third-party intellectual property rights, the Company may be unable to obtain a license to use such technology, and it could incur substantial costs to redesign its products, withdraw them from the market, or to defend legal actions.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The Company s brands may be damaged by the actions of its licensees.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The Company licenses its trademarks to third-party licensees who produce, market and sell their products bearing the Company s trademarks.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	The Company chooses its licensees carefully and imposes upon such licensees various restrictions on the products, and on the manner, on which such trademarks may be used.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P47_S2	In addition, the Company requires its licensees to abide by certain standards of conduct and the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P47_S3	However, if a licensee fails to adhere to these requirements, the Company s brands could be damaged.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P47_S4	The Company s brands could also be damaged if a licensee becomes insolvent or by any negative publicity concerning a licensee or if the licensee does not maintain good relationships with its customers or consumers, many of which are also the Company s customers and consumers.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P47_S5	Sales of the Company s products by unauthorized retailers or distributors could adversely affect the Company s authorized distribution channels and harm the Company s reputation.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P47_S6	Some of the Company s products find their way to unauthorized outlets or distribution channels.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P47_S7	This gray market for the Company s products can undermine authorized retailers and foreign wholesale distributors who promote and support the Company s products, and can injure the Company s image in the minds of its customers and consumers.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P47_S8	On the other hand, stopping such commerce could result in a potential decrease in sales to those customers who are selling the Company s products to unauthorized distributors or an increase in sales returns over historical levels.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P47_S9	While the Company has taken some lawful steps to limit commerce of its products in the gray market in both the United States and abroad, it has not stopped such commerce.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The Company has significant international operations and is exposed to risks associated with doing business globally.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	The Company sells and distributes its products directly in many key international markets in Europe, Asia, North America and elsewhere around the world.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	These activities have resulted and will continue to result in investments in inventory, accounts receivable, employees, corporate infrastructure and facilities.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P48_S3	In addition, there are a limited number of suppliers of golf club components in the United States, and the Company has increasingly become more reliant on suppliers and vendors located outside of the United States.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P48_S4	The operation of foreign distribution in the Company s international markets, as well as the management of relationships with international suppliers and vendors, will continue to require the dedication of management and other Company resources.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The Company manufactures most of its products outside of the United States.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	As a result of this international business, the Company is exposed to increased risks inherent in conducting business outside of the United States.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In addition to foreign currency risks, these risks include:
837465_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Increased exposure to interruptions in air carrier or ship services.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Any significant adverse change in circumstances or conditions could have a significant adverse effect upon the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the Company's effective income tax rate and profitability.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Company has not previously provided for U.S. taxes.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	The Company regularly assesses all of these matters to determine the adequacy of its tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The Company relies on complex information systems for management of its manufacturing, distribution, sales and other functions.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P53_S1	If the Company s information systems fail to perform these functions adequately or if the Company experiences an interruption in their operation, including a breach in cyber security, its business and results of operations could suffer.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	All of the Company s major operations, including manufacturing, distribution, sales and accounting, are dependent upon the Company s complex information systems.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The Company s information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:
837465_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Hackers, computer viruses, software bugs or glitches.
837465_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Any damage or significant disruption in the operation of such systems or the failure of the Company s information systems to perform as expected would disrupt the Company s business, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess inventory and product shortages and otherwise adversely affect the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	In February 2013, the Company sold its golf ball manufacturing plant in Chicopee, Massachusetts and leased back approximately 232,000 square feet, which the Company believes is adequate for its ongoing golf ball manufacturing operations at such facility.
837465_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	The lease term for this facility expires in February 2018.
837465_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	The Company also leases a golf club manufacturing facility in Monterrey, Mexico comprised of approximately 180,000 square feet.
837465_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	The lease term for this facility expires in February 2018.
837465_16_ITEM2_P0_S4	In addition, the Company leases a distribution center in Roanoke, Texas comprised of approximately 202,000 square feet.
837465_16_ITEM2_P0_S5	The lease term for this facility expires in September 2020.
837465_16_ITEM2_P0_S6	The Company owns and leases additional properties domestically and internationally, including properties in the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom, China, and India.
837465_16_ITEM2_P0_S7	The Company s operations at each of these properties includes to some extent activities related to both the golf club and golf ball businesses.
837465_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company believes that its facilities currently are adequate to meet its requirements.
837465_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to liquidity, capital availability and quarterly determinations that cash dividends are in the best interests of its shareholders.
837465_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	Future dividends may be affected by, among other items, the Company s views on potential future capital requirements, projected cash flows and needs, changes to the Company s business model, and certain restrictions limiting dividends imposed by the ABL Facility (see Note 3 Financing Arrangements , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	Performance Graph The following graph presents a comparison of the cumulative total shareholder return of the Company s common stock since December 31, 2010 to two indices: the Standard Poor s 500 Index ( S P 500 ) and the Standard Poor s 600 Smallcap Index ( S P 600 ).
837465_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	The S P 500 tracks the aggregate price performance of equity securities of 500 large-cap companies that are actively traded in the United States, and is considered to be a leading indicator of U.S. equity securities.
837465_16_ITEM5_P1_S2	The S P 600 is a market value-weighted index that tracks the aggregate price performance of equity securities from a broad range of small-cap stocks traded in the United States.
837465_16_ITEM5_P1_S3	The graph assumes an initial investment of $100 at December 31, 2010 and reinvestment of all dividends in ELY stock on the dividend payable date.
837465_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	The Callaway Golf Company cumulative total shareholder return is based upon the closing prices of Callaway Golf Company common stock on December 31, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 of $8.07, $5.53, $6.50, $8.43, $7.70 and $9.42, respectively.
837465_16_ITEM5_P2_S1	In August 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a $50.0 million share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase shares of its common stock in the open market or in private transactions, subject to the Company s assessment of market conditions and buying opportunities.
837465_16_ITEM5_P2_S2	The repurchases will be made consistent with the terms of the Company's credit facility which defines the amount of stock that can be repurchased.
837465_16_ITEM5_P2_S3	The repurchase program will remain in effect until completed or until terminated by the Board of Directors.
837465_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	The table below summarizes the Company's share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2015.
837465_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	During 2015, the Company repurchased approximately 217,000 shares of its common stock under the 2014 repurchase program at an average cost per share of $9.03 for a total cost of $2.0 million .
837465_16_ITEM5_P4_S1	The Company acquired these shares to satisfy the Company's tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting and settlement of employee restricted stock units awards.
837465_16_ITEM5_P4_S2	The Company s repurchases of shares of common stock are recorded at cost and result in a reduction of shareholders equity.
837465_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	(1) On August 29, 2012, the Company issued $112.5 million of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes (the convertible notes ) in exchange for cash and 0.6 million shares of the Company s then-outstanding 7.50% Series B Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock in separate, privately negotiated exchange transactions.
837465_16_ITEM6_P0_S1	During the second half of 2015, the convertible notes were eliminated pursuant to certain exchange transactions and shareholder conversions, which resulted, among other things, in the issuance of approximately 15.0 million shares of common stock to the note holders (see Note 3 Financing Arrangements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_16_ITEM6_P0_S2	In connection with the elimination of the convertible notes and the issuance of the 15.0 million shares of common stock, the Company recorded $109.0 million in shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2015, net of the outstanding discount of $3.4 million.
837465_16_ITEM6_P0_S3	The Company recognized interest expense of $3.2 million , $5.0 million and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013, respectively.
837465_16_ITEM6_P0_S4	(2) The Company s operating statements for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 include pre-tax charges of $16.6 million and $54.1 million, respectively, in connection with the Company's cost-reduction initiatives that were announced in July 2012 (the "Cost Reduction Initiatives").
837465_16_ITEM6_P0_S5	As a result of these initiatives, in 2012, the Company recorded related decreases in working capital and total assets from the impairment of certain intangible assets including goodwill, as well as the write-off of certain long-lived assets and inventory.
837465_16_ITEM6_P0_S6	See Note 17 Restructuring Initiatives " in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. (3) During the first quarter of 2012, in an effort to simplify the Company s operations and increase focus on the Company s core Callaway and Odyssey business, the Company sold its Top-Flite and Ben Hogan brands, including trademarks, service marks and certain other intellectual property for net cash proceeds of $26.9 million.
837465_16_ITEM6_P0_S7	The sale of these two brands resulted in a pre-tax net gain of $6.6 million.
837465_16_ITEM6_P0_S8	(4) The Company s operating statements for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 include pre-tax charges of $1.0 million and $16.3 million, respectively, in connection with workforce reductions related to the reorganization and reinvestment initiatives announced in June 2011.
837465_16_ITEM6_P0_S9	(5) The Company s provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2011 includes $52.5 million of tax expense in order to establish a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets and $21.6 million related to the recognition of certain prepaid tax expenses on intercompany profits.
837465_16_ITEM6_P0_S10	The reduction of deferred tax assets had a corresponding decrease in working capital and total assets, as well as an increase in long-term liabilities.
837465_16_ITEM6_P0_S11	See Note 9 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. (6) In connection with the global operations strategy initiatives that were announced in 2010, the Company s operating statements for the years ended December 31, 2011 include a pre-tax charge of $24.7 million related to these initiatives.
837465_16_ITEM6_P0_S12	In 2011, the Company recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $5.4 million in connection with the write-down of certain trademarks and trade names.
837465_16_ITEM6_P0_S13	Additionally, in 2011, the Company recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $1.1 million in connection with the write-off of goodwill.
837465_16_ITEM6_P0_S14	(8) In March 2011, the Company completed the sale of three of its buildings located in Carlsbad, California.
837465_16_ITEM6_P0_S15	In connection with this sale, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $6.2 million.
837465_16_ITEM6_P0_S16	This update eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet, and instead classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent.
837465_16_ITEM6_P0_S17	The adoption of this update was made on a prospective basis as of December 31, 2015, therefore working capital and long-term liabilities in 2015 are not comparable to prior periods presented.
837465_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations, financial condition and liquidity are based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
837465_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, shareholders equity, sales and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
837465_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
837465_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
837465_16_ITEM7_P0_S4	On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business and new information as it becomes available.
837465_16_ITEM7_P0_S5	Management believes the critical accounting policies discussed below affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
837465_16_ITEM7_P0_S6	For a complete discussion of all of the Company s significant accounting policies, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized, in general, as products are shipped to customers, net of an allowance for sales returns and accruals for sales programs in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.
837465_16_ITEM7_P0_S7	In certain cases, the Company recognizes sales when products are received by customers.
837465_16_ITEM7_P0_S8	The Company records a reserve for anticipated returns through a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the period that the related sales are recorded.
837465_16_ITEM7_P0_S9	Sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through of products.
837465_16_ITEM7_P0_S10	In addition, from time to time, the Company offers sales programs that allow for specific returns.
837465_16_ITEM7_P0_S11	The Company records a reserve for anticipated returns related to these sales programs based on the terms of the sales program.
837465_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Historically, the Company s actual sales returns have not been materially different from management s original estimates.
837465_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance for sales returns.
837465_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	However, if the actual costs of sales returns are significantly different than the recorded estimated allowance, the Company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
837465_16_ITEM7_P1_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the recorded estimated allowance for 2015 sales returns, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2015 would have decreased by approximately $0.8 million .
837465_16_ITEM7_P1_S4	The Company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings.
837465_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program, management s forecast of future product demand, and historical customer participation in similar programs.
837465_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Company s primary sales program, the Preferred Retailer Program, offers longer payment terms during the initial sell-in period, as well as potential rebates and discounts, for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the Company, including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels, prime product placement and retailer staff training.
837465_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	Under this program, qualifying retailers can earn either discounts or rebates based upon the amount of product purchased.
837465_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	Discounts are applied and recorded at the time of sale.
837465_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	For rebates, the Company accrues an estimate of the rebate at the time of sale based on the customer s estimated qualifying current year product purchases.
837465_16_ITEM7_P3_S4	The estimate is based on the historical level of purchases, adjusted for any factors expected to affect the current year purchase levels.
837465_16_ITEM7_P3_S5	The estimated year-end rebate is adjusted quarterly based on actual purchase levels, as necessary.
837465_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Preferred Retailer Program is generally short term in nature and the actual costs of the program are known as of the end of the year and paid to customers shortly after year-end.
837465_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	In addition to the Preferred Retailer Program, the Company from time to time offers additional sales program incentive offerings which are also generally short term in nature.
837465_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Historically the Company s actual costs related to its Preferred Retailer Program and other sales programs have not been materially different than its estimates.
837465_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed.
837465_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	In addition, the Company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws.
837465_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	The Company s gift cards have no expiration.
837465_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	To determine when redemption is remote, the Company analyzes an aging of unredeemed cards (based on the date the card was last used or the activation date if the card has never been used) and compares that information with historical redemption trends.
837465_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to determine the timing of recognition of gift card revenues.
837465_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	The deferred revenue associated with outstanding gift cards remained flat at $1.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments.
837465_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	An estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, the customer s financial condition and current economic trends, all of which are subject to change.
837465_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	If the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance, the Company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected.
837465_16_ITEM7_P10_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase in uncollectible accounts over the 2015 recorded estimated allowance for doubtful accounts, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2015 would have decreased by approximately $0.6 million .
837465_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value.
837465_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
837465_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	The inventory balance, which includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs, is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory.
837465_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	The estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon current inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience as well as management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand, all of which are subject to change.
837465_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	The calculation of the Company s allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand and pricing, regulatory (USGA and R A) rule changes, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence.
837465_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance.
837465_16_ITEM7_P13_S4	However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner, the Company may need to increase its inventory allowance, which could significantly adversely affect the Company s operating results.
837465_16_ITEM7_P13_S5	Assuming there had been a 10% increase in obsolete or unmarketable inventory over the 2015 recorded estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2015 would have decreased by approximately $1.6 million .
837465_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company acquires tangible and intangible assets.
837465_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and amortizing intangible assets, and investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable or exceeds its fair value.
837465_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	The Company evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually or more frequently whenever indicators are present that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.
837465_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining the amount of undiscounted cash flows directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, the timing of the impairment test, and the asset s residual value, if any.
837465_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	To determine fair value, the Company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate.
837465_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the asset and a charge to earnings.
837465_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	The Company uses its best judgment based on current facts and circumstances related to its business when making these estimates.
837465_16_ITEM7_P15_S3	However, if actual results are not consistent with the Company s estimates and assumptions used in calculating future cash flows and asset fair values, the Company may be exposed to losses that could be material.
837465_16_ITEM7_P15_S4	The Company completed its annual impairment test and fair value analysis of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2015 , and the estimated fair values of the Company s reporting units in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Korea, as well as the estimated fair values of certain trade names and trademarks, exceeded their carrying values.
837465_16_ITEM7_P15_S5	As a result, no impairment was recorded as of December 31, 2015 .
837465_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Warranty Policy The Company has a stated two-year warranty policy for its golf clubs.
837465_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	The Company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded.
837465_16_ITEM7_P16_S2	In estimating its future warranty obligations, the Company considers various relevant factors, including the Company s stated warranty policies and practices, the historical frequency of claims, and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty.
837465_16_ITEM7_P16_S3	The Company s estimates for calculating the warranty reserve are principally based on assumptions regarding the warranty costs of each club product line over the expected warranty period.
837465_16_ITEM7_P16_S4	Where little or no claims experience may exist, the Company s warranty obligation calculation is based upon long-term historical warranty rates of similar products until sufficient data is available.
837465_16_ITEM7_P16_S5	As actual model-specific rates become available, the Company s estimates are modified to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes.
837465_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Historically, the Company s actual warranty claims have not been materially different from management s original estimated warranty obligation.
837465_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the warranty obligation.
837465_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	However, if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims were to significantly exceed the estimated warranty reserve, the Company may be exposed to losses that could be material.
837465_16_ITEM7_P17_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase in warranty claims over the 2015 recorded estimated allowance for warranty obligations, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2015 would have decreased by approximately $0.6 million .
837465_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Income Taxes Current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year.
837465_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
837465_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	The Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
837465_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire.
837465_16_ITEM7_P19_S3	These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment, including estimates of future taxable income.
837465_16_ITEM7_P19_S4	These estimates are based on the Company s best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions.
837465_16_ITEM7_P19_S5	In 2011, as a result of this evaluation, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets due to losses generated in the United States.
837465_16_ITEM7_P19_S6	At the end of each interim and annual reporting period, as the U.S. deferred tax assets are adjusted upwards or downwards, the associated valuation allowance and income tax expense are also adjusted.
837465_16_ITEM7_P19_S7	If sufficient positive evidence arises in the future, such as a sustained return to profitability in the U.S. business, the valuation allowance could be reversed as appropriate, decreasing income tax expense and creating a significant one-time non-cash tax benefit in the period that such conclusion is reached.
837465_16_ITEM7_P19_S8	Prospectively, the Company would then report an effective U.S. income tax rate that is closer to statutory rates.
837465_16_ITEM7_P19_S9	The Company has concluded that with respect to non-U.S. entities, there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that the realization of its deferred tax assets is deemed to be likely, and no significant allowances have been established.
837465_16_ITEM7_P19_S10	In addition, the Company has discontinued recognizing income tax benefits related to its U.S. net operating losses until it is determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefits from its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_16_ITEM7_P19_S11	Pursuant to ASC Topic 740-25-6, the Company is required to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is deemed to be more likely than not that the Company would be required to pay such additional taxes.
837465_16_ITEM7_P19_S12	The Company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions.
837465_16_ITEM7_P19_S13	The preparation of these income tax returns requires the Company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by the Company.
837465_16_ITEM7_P19_S14	The Company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability, including interest and penalties, for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return.
837465_16_ITEM7_P19_S15	The Company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available.
837465_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Historically, additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the Company s uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the Company s expectations.
837465_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Information regarding income taxes is contained in Note 9 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Share-based Compensation The Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and non-employees based on estimated fair values.
837465_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	ASC Topic 718 further requires a reduction in share-based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	The forfeiture rate used by the Company is based on historical forfeiture trends.
837465_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	If actual forfeitures are not consistent with the Company s estimates, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods.
837465_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Performance share units are stock-based awards in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on the Company's performance against specified goals that are measured over a designated performance period from the date of grant.
837465_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	These performance goals are established by the Company at the beginning of the performance period.
837465_16_ITEM7_P23_S2	At the end of the performance period, the number of shares of stock that could be issued is fixed based upon the degree of achievement of the performance goals.
837465_16_ITEM7_P23_S3	The number of shares that could be issued can range from 50% to 150% of the participant's target award.
837465_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Performance share units are initially valued at the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant.
837465_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	Compensation expense for performance share units is recognized over the vesting period and is reduced by an estimate for forfeitures, and will vary based on remeasurements during the performance period.
837465_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	If the performance goals are not probable of achievement during the performance period, compensation expense would be reversed.
837465_16_ITEM7_P24_S3	The awards are forfeited if the performance goals are not achieved as of the end of the performance period.
837465_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	The performance units vest in full at the end of a three year period.
837465_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options and stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) at the date of grant.
837465_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the Company s expected stock price volatility, the expected dividend yield, the expected term of an option or SAR and the risk-free interest rate, which is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
837465_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected price volatility and the expected term.
837465_16_ITEM7_P26_S3	The Company uses forecasted dividends to estimate the expected dividend yield.
837465_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option or SAR.
837465_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option or SAR does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee.
837465_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for stock options.
837465_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	Compensation expense for SARs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an award s estimated fair value, which is remeasured at the end of each reporting period.
837465_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	Once vested, SARs continued to be remeasured to fair value until they are exercised.
837465_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company records compensation expense for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (collectively restricted stock ) based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
837465_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	The estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares underlying the award.
837465_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, reduced by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Phantom stock units are a form of share-based awards that are indexed to the Company s stock and are settled in cash.
837465_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	Compensation expense for Phantom Stock Units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the award s estimated fair value.
837465_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	Fair value is remeasured at the end of each interim reporting period through the award s settlement date and is based on the closing price of the Company s stock.
837465_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Foreign Currency Translation A significant portion of the Company s business is conducted outside of the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
837465_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	As a result, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on the Company s financial results.
837465_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Revenues and expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the average exchange rate for the period.
837465_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date.
837465_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	Gains and losses from assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity on which they reside are generally recognized currently in the Company's statements of operations.
837465_16_ITEM7_P32_S3	Gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.
837465_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	As part of the Company's overall strategy to manage its level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts.
837465_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	While these foreign currency forward contracts can mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, they do not eliminate those effects, which can be significant.
837465_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	For all contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges, the Company records gains and losses either in earnings as a component of cost of goods sold or as a component of other comprehensive income or loss.
837465_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	Gains and losses on derivatives that are not elected for hedge accounting treatment or that do not meet hedge accounting requirements are recorded in earnings in other income (expense).
837465_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by this reference.
837465_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Discussion of non-GAAP Measures In addition to the financial results contained in this report, which have been prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ), the Company has also included supplemental information concerning the Company s financial results on a non-GAAP basis.
837465_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	This non-GAAP information includes certain of the Company s financial results on a constant currency basis.
837465_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	This constant currency information estimates what the Company s financial results would have been without changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_16_ITEM7_P36_S3	This information is calculated by taking the current period local currency results and translating them into U.S. Dollars based upon the foreign currency exchange rates for the applicable comparable prior period.
837465_16_ITEM7_P36_S4	The calculation excludes foreign currency net gains and losses recognized in other income (expense) from translation of transactions denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency gains and losses recognized from the Company's hedging contracts.
837465_16_ITEM7_P36_S5	It does not include any other effect of changes in foreign currency rates on the Company s results or business.
837465_16_ITEM7_P36_S6	The Company has included in this report information to reconcile this non-GAAP information to the most directly correlated GAAP information.
837465_16_ITEM7_P36_S7	The non-GAAP information presented in this report should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with GAAP.
837465_16_ITEM7_P36_S8	The non-GAAP information may also be inconsistent with the manner in which similar measures are derived or used by other companies.
837465_16_ITEM7_P36_S9	Management uses such non-GAAP information for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period over period comparisons of the underlying performance of its business and in forecasting the Company s business going forward.
837465_16_ITEM7_P36_S10	Management believes that the presentation of such non-GAAP information, when considered in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP information, provides additional useful comparative information for investors in their assessment of the underlying performance of the Company s business.
837465_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Results of Operations Overview of Business, Seasonality and Foreign Currency Products.
837465_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	The Company designs, manufactures and sells high quality golf clubs, golf balls, golf bags and other golf-related accessories.
837465_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	The Company designs its products to be technologically advanced and in this regard invests a considerable amount in research and development each year.
837465_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	The Company s golf products are designed for golfers of all skill levels, both amateur and professional.
837465_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	The Company has two reportable operating segments that are organized on the basis of products, namely the golf clubs segment and golf balls segment.
837465_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	The golf clubs segment consists of Callaway Golf woods, hybrids, irons and wedges and Odyssey putters.
837465_16_ITEM7_P40_S3	This segment also includes other golf-related accessories described above and royalties from licensing of the Company s trademarks and service marks as well as sales of pre-owned golf clubs.
837465_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	The golf balls segment consists of Callaway Golf and Strata balls that are designed, manufactured and sold by the Company.
837465_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	As discussed in Note 18 Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, the Company s operating segments exclude a significant amount of corporate general administrative expenses and other income (expense) not utilized by management in determining segment profitability.
837465_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	The Company s cost of sales is comprised primarily of material and component costs, distribution and warehousing costs, and overhead.
837465_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	Due to the recent actions taken to improve manufacturing efficiencies, a greater percentage of the Company's manufacturing costs became variable in nature and will fluctuate with sales volumes.
837465_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	With respect to the Company's operating segments, variable costs for golf clubs represent approximately 85% to 95% of cost of sales, and for golf balls, approximately 75% to 85%.
837465_16_ITEM7_P43_S3	Of these variable costs, material and component costs represent approximately 85% to 95% for golf clubs and approximately 75% to 85% for golf balls.
837465_16_ITEM7_P43_S4	On a consolidated basis, over 85% of total cost of sales is variable in nature, and of this amount, over 85% is comprised of material and component costs.
837465_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	of cost of sales does not vary materially from these percentages from period to period.
837465_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	See "Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 - Segment Profitability" and "Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 - Segment Profitability" below for further discussion of gross margins.
837465_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	In most of the regions where the Company does business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis.
837465_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	Weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year-round, except in a few markets, with many of the Company s on-course customers closing for the cold weather months.
837465_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	The Company s business is therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_16_ITEM7_P45_S3	In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season.
837465_16_ITEM7_P45_S4	This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter.
837465_16_ITEM7_P45_S5	The Company s second-quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter.
837465_16_ITEM7_P45_S6	The Company s third-quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but are generally less than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season.
837465_16_ITEM7_P45_S7	The Company s fourth-quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company s key markets.
837465_16_ITEM7_P45_S8	However, fourth-quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year.
837465_16_ITEM7_P45_S9	This seasonality, and therefore quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as well as weather conditions.
837465_16_ITEM7_P45_S10	In general, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company s sales and most, if not all, of its profitability occurs during the first half of the year.
837465_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	A significant portion of the Company s business is conducted outside of the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
837465_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	As a result, changes in foreign currency rates can have a significant effect on the Company s financial results.
837465_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates.
837465_16_ITEM7_P46_S3	While these foreign currency forward contracts can mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates, they do not eliminate those effects, which can be significant.
837465_16_ITEM7_P46_S4	These effects include (i) the translation of results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, (ii) the mark-to-market adjustments of certain intercompany balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies and (iii) the mark-to-market adjustments on the Company s foreign currency forward contracts.
837465_16_ITEM7_P46_S5	In general, the Company s overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts its business.
837465_16_ITEM7_P46_S6	During 2015, the Company s reported net sales in regions outside the United States were negatively affected by the translation of foreign currency sales into U.S. dollars based on 2015 exchange rates.
837465_16_ITEM7_P46_S7	If 2014 exchange rates were applied to 2015 reported sales in regions outside the United States and all other factors were held constant, net sales in such regions would have been $53.2 million higher than the net sales reported in 2015.
837465_16_ITEM7_P46_S8	Additionally, in general, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts its business, primarily the Japanese Yen.
837465_16_ITEM7_P46_S9	If this trend persists or if the U.S. dollar further strengthens against these currencies, it could significantly adversely impact the Company's future results of operations.
837465_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	Executive Summary Despite significant headwinds from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in 2015, the Company s operational performance, market share and brand momentum continued to improve.
837465_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	The success of the Company s 2015 golf club product line contributed to the Company achieving the number one dollar market share position in the United States in total golf clubs (per Golf Datatech).
837465_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	In addition to improved operational performance, the Company also strengthened its balance sheet through the retirement of its outstanding convertible debt in 2015.
837465_16_ITEM7_P47_S3	The Company s net sales in 2015 decreased 5% to $843.8 million compared to $886.9 million in 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	As mentioned above, foreign currency exchange rates had a significant adverse effect on the Company s net sales, which negatively impacted net sales by $53.2 million in 2015.
837465_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	On a constant currency basis, net sales for 2015 would have increased by 1% compared to 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	The sales growth in 2015 was tempered by a planned strategic shift in product launch timing, which adversely affected first quarter net sales, and softer than expected market conditions in the Company s international markets, particularly in Asia.
837465_16_ITEM7_P48_S3	The Company s gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased by 200 basis points, to 42.4% in 2015 compared to 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P48_S4	On a constant currency basis, gross margin would have increased by 510 basis points to 45.5% compared to the gross margin reported in 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P48_S5	This increase was primarily due to more favorable product pricing and mix of higher margin products, fewer closeouts, a decrease in promotional activities and cost savings from improved manufacturing efficiencies.
837465_16_ITEM7_P48_S6	This was partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P48_S7	Operating expenses increased by $3.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in stock compensation expense as a result of an increase in the Company's stock price period over period.
837465_16_ITEM7_P48_S8	On a constant currency basis, operating expenses would have increased by $14.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Other income/expense improved to other income of $1.5 million in 2015 compared to other expense of $0.1 million in 2014, primarily due to an increase in net foreign currency gains.
837465_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	Interest expense decreased to $8.7 million in 2015 compared to $9.5 million in 2014 due to lower average outstanding borrowings in 2015, offset by the recognition of non-recurring expenses related to the exchange transactions to retire the Company s convertible debt in 2015.
837465_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	In 2015, net income decreased by $1.4 million (9%) to $14.6 million, and diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.03 (15%) to $0.17 compared to 2014 due to the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_16_ITEM7_P49_S3	On a constant currency basis, the Company's net income in 2015 would have increased by $36.1 million (226%) to $52.1 million, and diluted earnings per share would have increased by $0.42 (210%) to $0.62 compared to 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	In February 2016, the Company announced an agreement in principle to form a joint venture with its long-time apparel licensee, TSI Groove Sports Co, Ltd., ( TSI ), a premier apparel manufacturer in Japan which is expected to be finalized during the second half of 2016.
837465_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	The planned venture will be named Callaway Apparel K.K. and will include the design, manufacture, retail and distribution of Callaway branded apparel, footwear and headwear in Japan.
837465_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	Callaway will own 52% of the planned joint venture and TSI will own the remaining 48%, which will result in the consolidation of the joint venture in the Company's future results of operations.
837465_16_ITEM7_P50_S3	Management believes this partnership with TSI will allow the two Companies to jointly invest and grow the business going forward.
837465_16_ITEM7_P50_S4	The completion of the planned joint venture is subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements and closing conditions and no assurance can be provided that it will close on the terms or timing described above.
837465_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $ 43.1 million (5%) to $843.8 million compared to $886.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
837465_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	This decrease was due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, a strategic shift in product launch timing which adversely affected first quarter net sales and softer than anticipated market conditions in the Company's international markets, particularly in Asia.
837465_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	On a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased by $10.1 million ( 1% ) to $897.0 million compared to $886.9 million in the prior year.
837465_16_ITEM7_P51_S3	The Company s net sales by operating segment are presented below (dollars in millions):
837465_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	For further discussion of each operating segment s results, see Golf Clubs Segment and Golf Balls Segment results below.
837465_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Net sales information by region is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	Net sales in the United States increased $24.7 million ( 6% ) to $446.5 million during 2015 compared to $421.8 million in 2014 , primarily as a result of increased brand momentum and market share improvement in most product categories.
837465_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	sales in regions outside of the United States decreased $67.8 million ( 15% ) to $397.3 million in 2015 compared to $465.1 million in 2014 , primarily due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates combined with softer than expected market conditions, particularly in Asia.
837465_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	On a constant currency basis, net sales in regions outside the United States would have decreased by $14.6 million ( 3% ) to $450.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $465.1 million in the prior year.
837465_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	Net sales in the U.S. and in regions outside the U.S. were both negatively impacted by the shift in product launch timing as mentioned above.
837465_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	Gross profit decreased $ 0.3 million to $ 357.6 million in 2015 from $ 357.9 million in 2014 .
837465_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	Gross profit as a percent of net sales ("gross margin") increased 200 basis points to 42.4% in 2015 from 40.4% in 2014 .
837465_16_ITEM7_P56_S3	This increase in gross margin was primarily due to (i) a favorable shift in product mix within the irons, putters and golf ball categories; (ii) an increase in average selling prices, primarily within the woods category; (iii) a decrease in closeouts and promotional activity; and (iv) improved operational efficiencies.
837465_16_ITEM7_P56_S4	These increases were partially offset by the decrease in net sales as discussed above, unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates period over period, and an increase in club component costs due to higher cost materials and technology incorporated into certain hybrid and putter product models.
837465_16_ITEM7_P56_S5	On a constant currency basis, gross margin would have increased by 510 basis points in 2015 compared to the gross margin reported in 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P56_S6	For a further discussion of gross margin, see "Segment Profitability" below.
837465_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	Selling expenses decreased by $5.3 million to $228.9 million ( 27.1% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $234.2 million ( 26.4% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2014 , primarily due to decreases of $2.2 million in salaries and wages due to fluctuations in foreign currency rates, $2.0 million in depreciation expense, $1.5 million in marketing and tour expenses and $0.7 million in consulting expenses.
837465_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	These decreases were partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in stock compensation expense primarily due to fluctuations in the Company's stock price.
837465_16_ITEM7_P57_S2	General and administrative expenses increased by $6.9 million to $68.6 million ( 8.1% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $61.7 million ( 7.0% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2014 , primarily due to a $4.1 million increase in stock compensation expense due to an increase in the Company's stock price and a $2.0 million increase in professional fees.
837465_16_ITEM7_P57_S3	Research and development expenses increased by $1.9 million to $33.2 million ( 3.9% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $31.3 million ( 3.5% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2014 , primarily due to an increase in employee costs as a result of higher employee incentive compensation in 2015.
837465_16_ITEM7_P57_S4	Interest expense decreased by $0.8 million to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $9.5 million in the comparable period of 2014 .
837465_16_ITEM7_P57_S5	This decrease was primarily due to lower average outstanding borrowings in 2015, partially offset by the recognition of $2.0 million of expense from the acceleration of debt issuance costs in connection with the exchange of the Company's convertible notes into shares of common stock during the current year (see Note 3 " Financing Arrangements " to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_16_ITEM7_P57_S6	Other income (expense) increased by $1.6 million to income of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to expense of $0.1 million in the comparable period of 2014 .
837465_16_ITEM7_P57_S7	The increase was primarily due to a $1.1 million increase in net foreign currency gains in 2015.
837465_16_ITEM7_P57_S8	The Company s provision for income taxes decreased slightly to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared to $5.6 million in the comparable period of 2014 .
837465_16_ITEM7_P57_S9	Due to the effects of the Company s valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets, the Company s income tax provision for 2015 and 2014 is primarily attributable to earnings generated by its foreign subsidiaries.
837465_16_ITEM7_P57_S10	Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased to $14.6 million compared to $16.0 million in the comparable period of 2014 .
837465_16_ITEM7_P57_S11	Diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.17 on 84.6 million diluted shares outstanding in 2015 from $0.20 on 78.4 million diluted shares outstanding in 2014 .
837465_16_ITEM7_P57_S12	Golf Clubs Segment Golf club sales decreased $49.2 million (7%) to $700.7 million in 2015 compared to $749.9 million in 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P57_S13	This decline was due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, a strategic shift in product launch timing, which adversely affected first quarter sales, and softer than expected market conditions in the Company's international markets, particularly in Asia.
837465_16_ITEM7_P57_S14	On a constant currency basis, net golf club sales would have decreased by $3.3 million (0.4%) compared to the net sales reported in 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	Net sales information for the golf clubs segment by product category is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	Net sales of woods decreased $47.3 million ( 18% ) to $222.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year.
837465_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	On a constant currency basis, net sales of woods would have decreased by 12% compared to the reported net sales in 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	This decrease resulted from a decline in sales volume primarily due to a shift in product launch timing resulting in fewer woods product launches during 2015 compared to the prior year.
837465_16_ITEM7_P59_S3	This was partially offset by price increases on certain current year products compared to their predecessors in 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P59_S4	Net sales of irons increased $5.3 million ( 3% ) to $205.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year.
837465_16_ITEM7_P59_S5	On a constant currency basis, net sales of irons would have increased 9% compared to the net sales reported in 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P59_S6	This increase was primarily attributable to the success of the Company's new Mac Daddy 3 wedges and XR irons launched in 2015 combined with an increase in average selling prices.
837465_16_ITEM7_P59_S7	The increase in average selling prices is due to less closeout and promotional activity in the current year.
837465_16_ITEM7_P59_S8	Net sales of putters increased $5.2 million ( 6% ) to $86.3 million for the year December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year.
837465_16_ITEM7_P59_S9	On a constant currency basis, net sales of putters would have increased by 14% compared to the net sales reported in 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P59_S10	This increase was primarily due to an increase in average selling prices and sales volumes due to the success of the current year Odyssey Works line of putters.
837465_16_ITEM7_P59_S11	Net sales of accessories and other products decreased $12.4 million ( 6% ) to $186.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates.
837465_16_ITEM7_P59_S12	On a constant currency basis, net sales of accessories and other would have been relatively flat compared to the net sales reported in 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P59_S13	Golf Balls Segment Net sales information for the golf balls segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Net sales of golf balls increased $ 6.1 million ( 4% ) to $ 143.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year.
837465_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	On a constant currency basis, net sales of golf balls would have increased by 10% compared to the net sales reported in 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P60_S2	This increase was driven by increases in sales volume and average selling prices resulting from a favorable shift in product mix due to the success of the Chrome Soft golf ball in the current year.
837465_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	Segment Profitability Profitability by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	(1) Reconciling items represent corporate general and administrative expenses and other income (expense) not included by management in determining segment profitability.
837465_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	The $6.1 million increase in reconciling items in 2015 compared to 2014 includes increases in stock compensation expense and professional fees, partially offset by a decrease in legal expenses combined with an increase in net foreign currency gains.
837465_16_ITEM7_P62_S2	Pre-tax income in the Company s golf clubs operating segment improved to $53.0 million for 2015 from $50.9 million for 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P62_S3	This increase was driven by an increase in gross margin combined with a decrease in operating expenses, offset by a decrease in net sales as discussed above.
837465_16_ITEM7_P62_S4	The increase in gross margin was primarily due to (i) a favorable shift in product mix within the irons category due to sales of higher margin XR and Big Bertha irons and Mac Daddy 3 wedges in 2015; (ii) a favorable shift in product mix within the putters category due to the success of the current year launch of the Odyssey Works putter line; (iii) an increase in average selling prices within the woods category primarily due to the XR line of hybrids, which were launched at a higher average selling price compared to the X2 Hot line of hybrids launched in 2014; (iv) a decrease in closeouts and promotional activity primarily within the woods, irons and putters categories; and (v) improved operational efficiencies.
837465_16_ITEM7_P62_S5	These increases were partially offset by decreased sales (due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates period over period), and an increase in club component costs due to higher cost materials and technology incorporated into certain hybrid and putter product models.
837465_16_ITEM7_P62_S6	The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expense and marketing expenses combined with the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on expenses.
837465_16_ITEM7_P62_S7	Pre-tax income in the Company s golf balls operating segment improved to $17.7 million for 2015 from $15.2 million for 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P62_S8	This increase was attributable to an increase in gross margin as well as an increase in net sales as discussed above, offset by an increase in operating expenses.
837465_16_ITEM7_P62_S9	The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a favorable shift in product mix due to sales of the higher margin Chrome Soft golf balls in 2015, compared to higher sales of lower margin mid- and value-priced golf balls in 2014, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates period over period.
837465_16_ITEM7_P62_S10	The increase in operating expenses was due to an increase in marketing spending on golf balls period over period, partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates on expenses.
837465_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $44.1 million (5%) to $886.9 million compared to $842.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
837465_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	This increase was due to increased sales in both the golf club and golf ball operating segments resulting primarily from continued brand momentum and the strong performance of the Big Bertha family of woods, APEX irons, and Speed Regime and Supersoft golf balls launched during 2014, which resulted in market share gains across all product categories.
837465_16_ITEM7_P63_S2	In addition, net sales were positively impacted by a strategic change in product launch timing.
837465_16_ITEM7_P63_S3	These increases were partially offset by challenging market conditions combined with $11.1 million of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency rates.
837465_16_ITEM7_P63_S4	The Company s net sales by operating segment are presented below (dollars in millions):
837465_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	For further discussion of each operating segment s results, see Golf Clubs Segment and Golf Balls Segment results below.
837465_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	Net sales information by region is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	Net sales in the United States increased $20.3 million (5%) to $421.8 million during 2014 compared to $401.5 million in 2013.
837465_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	The Company s sales in regions outside of the United States increased $23.8 million (5%) to $465.1 million in 2014 compared to $441.3 million in 2013.
837465_16_ITEM7_P66_S2	This overall 5% increase in net sales in all regions was due to the continued improvement in brand momentum as a result of the strong performance of 2014 product introductions, which resulted in market share gains across all product categories primarily in the United States and Europe.
837465_16_ITEM7_P66_S3	This increase was partially offset by continued industry softness as well as the unfavorable impact of the translation of foreign currency sales into U.S. dollars based upon 2014 exchange rates.
837465_16_ITEM7_P66_S4	If 2013 exchange rates were applied to 2014 reported sales in regions outside the United States and all other factors were held constant, net sales in such regions would have been $11.1 million higher than reported during the year ended December 31, 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P66_S5	Gross profit increased $43.1 million to $357.9 million in 2014 from $314.8 million in 2013.
837465_16_ITEM7_P66_S6	Gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 40.4% in 2014 compared to 37.3% in 2013.
837465_16_ITEM7_P66_S7	This increase in gross margin was primarily due to (i) a favorable shift in sales mix to higher margin woods, irons and golf balls products in 2014 compared to 2013, combined with an increase in average selling prices of certain woods and irons products in 2014 compared to 2013; (ii) cost savings from improved manufacturing and distribution efficiencies; and (iii) charges incurred in 2013 in connection with the Company's Cost Reduction Initiatives.
837465_16_ITEM7_P66_S8	These improvements were partially offset by (i) an increase in club component costs due to more expensive materials and technology incorporated into certain putters and woods products launched in 2014, and (ii) the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency rates.
837465_16_ITEM7_P66_S9	Selling expenses increased by $7.7 million to $234.2 million (26.4% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $226.5 million (26.9% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2013, primarily due to a $6.2 million increase in marketing and tour expenses.
837465_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	General and administrative expenses decreased by $6.4 million to $61.7 million (7.0% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $68.1 million (8.1% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2013.
837465_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	This decrease was primarily due to a $5.4 million decrease in bad debt expense as a result of additional reserves taken in 2013 related to specific accounts, in addition to a $2.2 million decrease in stock compensation expense as a result of a 9% decrease in the Company's stock price in 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	These decreases were partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in accrued employee bonus and compensation.
837465_16_ITEM7_P67_S3	Research and development expenses increased by $0.4 million to $31.3 million (3.5% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $30.9 million (3.7% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2013, primarily due to an increase in employee costs as a result of accrued employee incentive compensation in 2014.

837465_16_ITEM7_P67_S9	Due to the effects of the Company s valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets, the Company s income tax provision for 2014 and 2013 is primarily attributable to earnings generated by its foreign subsidiaries.
837465_16_ITEM7_P67_S10	Net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased to $16.0 million compared to a net loss of $18.9 million in the comparable period of 2013.

837465_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	The $19.7 million (8%) increase in net sales of woods to $269.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from an increase in average selling prices combined with a slight increase in sales volume.

837465_16_ITEM7_P69_S2	The $21.4 million (12%) increase in net sales of irons to $200.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in average selling prices due to a favorable shift in product mix due to the success of the more premium APEX and Big Bertha irons during 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P69_S3	The $6.7 million (8%) decrease in net sales of putters to $81.1 million for the year December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to a decline in sales volume partially offset by an increase in average selling prices.
837465_16_ITEM7_P69_S4	The decline in sales volume was due to a shift in product launches to more premium models launched in 2014 compared to core (higher volume) putter models launched in 2013.
837465_16_ITEM7_P69_S5	The increase in average selling prices was primarily due to a favorable shift in product mix due to increased sales of the Company's new counterbalanced technology putters (Tank and Tank Cruiser) as well as the introduction of the Company's new elite Metal X Milled putter during 2014, with no comparable elite putter launch in 2013.

837465_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	Net gains of $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 related to foreign currency hedging contracts offset by foreign currency transaction losses.
837465_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	Net gains related to foreign currency were nominal for the year ended December 31, 2014.
837465_16_ITEM7_P73_S2	Pre-tax income in the Company s golf clubs operating segment improved to $50.9 million for 2014 from $32.7 million for 2013.
837465_16_ITEM7_P73_S3	This increase was driven by an increase in net sales as discussed above combined with an increase in gross margin, offset by an increase in operating expenses.
837465_16_ITEM7_P73_S4	The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by (i) a favorable shift in sales mix to the higher margin Big Bertha family of drivers and irons in 2014 compared to the X Hot family of drivers and irons in 2013; (ii) an increase in average selling prices on the X2 Hot family of drivers, fairway woods and irons in 2014 compared to the X Hot golf club products in 2013; (iii) cost savings from improved manufacturing and distribution efficiencies; and (iv) charges incurred in 2013 in connection with the Company's Cost Reduction Initiatives.
837465_16_ITEM7_P73_S5	These increases were partially offset by (i) an increase in club component costs due to more expensive materials and technology incorporated into certain woods and putter products launched in 2014, and (ii) the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency rates year over year.
837465_16_ITEM7_P73_S6	The increase in operating expenses during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in marketing expenses, as discussed above.
837465_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	Pre-tax income in the Company s golf balls operating segment improved to $15.2 million for 2014 from pre-tax loss of $3.4 million for 2013.
837465_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	This increase was attributable to an increase in gross margin as well as an increase in net sales as discussed above, combined with a slight decrease in operating expenses.
837465_16_ITEM7_P74_S2	The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by (i) the launch of the premium Speed Regime golf balls in 2014 with no comparable premium launch in 2013, combined with an increase in average selling prices on value-priced golf balls; and (ii) cost savings from improved manufacturing and distribution efficiencies.
837465_16_ITEM7_P74_S3	These increases were partially offset by the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency rates year over year.

837465_16_ITEM7_P74_S5	Cash generated from operating activities decreased by $6.3 million to $30.6 million during 2015 compared to cash generated of $36.9 million during 2014 .
837465_16_ITEM7_P74_S6	The decrease in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the timing of inventory purchases in support of new product launches, in addition to the timing of cash collections.
837465_16_ITEM7_P74_S7	In 2015, the Company used its cash and cash equivalents as well as cash generated from operations to pay down outstanding borrowings on the ABL Facility, as well as to fund $14.4 million in capital expenditures, $3.1 million in a note receivable and $0.9 million in investments in golf-related ventures.
837465_16_ITEM7_P74_S8	Management expects to fund the Company s future operations from current cash balances and cash provided by its operating activities combined with borrowings under its credit facilities, as deemed necessary (see Note 3 " Financing Arrangements " in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on the ABL Facility).
837465_16_ITEM7_P74_S9	The Company s accounts receivable balance fluctuates throughout the year as a result of the general seasonality of the Company s business.
837465_16_ITEM7_P74_S10	The Company s accounts receivable balance will generally be at its highest during the first and second quarters and decline significantly during the third and fourth quarters as a result of an increase in cash collections and lower sales.
837465_16_ITEM7_P74_S11	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company s net accounts receivable increased $5.8 million to $ 115.6 million from $ 109.8 million as of December 31, 2014 .
837465_16_ITEM7_P74_S12	This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, combined with a decrease in the reserve for doubtful accounts.
837465_16_ITEM7_P74_S13	The Company s inventory balance also fluctuates throughout the year as a result of the general seasonality of the Company s business.
837465_16_ITEM7_P74_S14	Generally, the Company s buildup of inventory levels begins during the fourth quarter and continues heavily into the first quarter as well as into the beginning of the second quarter in order to meet demand during the height of the golf season.
837465_16_ITEM7_P74_S15	Inventory levels start to decline toward the end of the second quarter and are at their lowest during the third quarter.
837465_16_ITEM7_P74_S16	Inventory levels are also impacted by the timing of new product launches.
837465_16_ITEM7_P74_S17	The Company s inventories increased slightly by $1.7 million to $ 208.9 million as of December 31, 2015 from $ 207.2 million as of December 31, 2014 .

837465_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources The information set forth in Note 3 Financing Arrangements , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, is incorporated herein by this reference.
837465_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	Liquidity The Company s principal sources of liquidity consist of its existing cash balances, funds expected to be generated from operations and its credit facilities.
837465_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	The Company experienced negative cash flows from operations in 2012 and 2013.
837465_16_ITEM7_P76_S2	During the second half of 2012, the Company implemented significant changes to its business, including among other things, steps designed to increase product sales as well as initiatives designed to reduce the Company s manufacturing costs and operating expenses.
837465_16_ITEM7_P76_S3	As a result of these initiatives, the Company's net sales and gross margin have increased and in 2014 and 2015, the Company generated positive cash flows from operations.
837465_16_ITEM7_P76_S4	Based upon the Company s current cash balances, its estimates of funds expected to be generated from operations in 2016, and current and projected availability under its credit facilities, the Company believes that it will be able to finance current and planned operating requirements, capital expenditures, contractual obligations and commercial commitments for at least the next 12 months.
837465_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	The Company s ability to generate sufficient positive cash flows from operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including future economic trends and conditions, demand for the Company s products, foreign currency exchange rates, and other risks and uncertainties applicable to the Company and its business (see Risk Factors contained in Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K).
837465_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows to fund its business due to a decline in sales or otherwise and is unable to reduce its manufacturing costs and operating expenses to offset such decline, the Company will need to increase its reliance on its credit facilities for needed liquidity.
837465_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	If the credit facilities are not then available or sufficient and the Company could not secure alternative financing arrangements, the Company s future operations would be materially adversely affected.
837465_16_ITEM7_P78_S2	To further enhance its liquidity position, the Company may obtain additional financing, which could consist of equity or debt financing from public and/or private credit and capital markets.
837465_16_ITEM7_P78_S3	In 2014, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Commission for the future sale of up to $200.0 million of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, rights, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and units.
837465_16_ITEM7_P78_S4	The securities may be offered from time to time, separately or together, directly by the Company or through underwriters, dealers or agents at amounts, prices, interest rates and other terms to be determined at the time of the offering.
837465_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	In connection with the Company's investment in Topgolf International, Inc., doing business as the Topgolf Entertainment Group ( Topgolf ), on February 22, 2016, Topgolf announced that it intends to repurchase shares from its existing shareholders.
837465_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	The Company has agreed to sell approximately 9.6% to 10.9% of the total shares it owns in Topgolf in connection with this repurchase program.
837465_16_ITEM7_P79_S2	If the intended repurchase is consummated, the Company could receive one-time cash proceeds of approximately $23.1 million to $26.1 million.
837465_16_ITEM7_P79_S3	For further discussion, see Note 7 "Investments" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 85% of the Company s total cash is held in regions outside of the United States.
837465_16_ITEM7_P79_S4	If the Company were to repatriate such cash, outside of settling intercompany balances during the normal course of operations, it would need to accrue and pay incremental U.S. federal and state income taxes, reduced by the current amount of available U.S. federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
837465_16_ITEM7_P79_S5	The Company has not, nor does it intend to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with its domestic debt service requirements.
837465_16_ITEM7_P79_S6	In 2015 and 2014, the Company ceased its business operations in Thailand and Malaysia, respectively, and accordingly, the Company no longer maintains a permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to these two entities.
837465_16_ITEM7_P79_S7	The Company intends to repatriate the undistributed earnings from these two entities to the United States at the time that the winding-down process has been completed.
837465_16_ITEM7_P79_S8	As of December 31, 2015, the Company has accrued for the estimated incremental U.S. income taxes related to reversing its permanent indefinite reinvestment assertion.
837465_16_ITEM7_P79_S9	However, these incremental U.S. income taxes are expected to be offset by the utilization of the Company's cumulative U.S. net operating losses incurred through December 31, 2015.
837465_16_ITEM7_P79_S10	Except for the Company's foreign subsidiaries in Thailand and Malaysia, the Company considers the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon.
837465_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	In August 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a $50.0 million share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase shares of its common stock in the open market or in private transactions, subject to the Company s assessment of market conditions and buying opportunities.
837465_16_ITEM7_P80_S1	The repurchases will be made consistent with the terms of the Company's ABL Facility which defines the amount of stock that can be repurchased.
837465_16_ITEM7_P80_S2	The repurchase program will remain in effect until completed or until terminated by the Board of Directors.
837465_16_ITEM7_P80_S3	During 2015, the Company repurchased approximately 217,000 shares of its common stock under the 2014 repurchase program at an average cost per share of $9.03 for a total cost of $2.0 million .
837465_16_ITEM7_P80_S4	The Company acquired these shares to satisfy the Company's tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting and settlement of employee restricted stock unit awards.
837465_16_ITEM7_P80_S5	The Company s repurchases of shares of common stock are recorded at cost and result in a reduction of shareholders equity.
837465_16_ITEM7_P80_S6	As of December 31, 2015, the total amount remaining under the repurchase authorization was $47.0 million.
837465_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	The following table summarizes certain significant cash obligations as of December 31, 2015 that will affect the Company s future liquidity (in millions):
837465_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	(1) Amounts represent future minimum lease payments.

837465_16_ITEM7_P83_S4	The amounts listed approximate minimum purchase obligations, base compensation and guaranteed minimum royalty payments the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements.
837465_16_ITEM7_P83_S5	The actual amounts paid under some of these agreements may be higher or lower than the amounts included.
837465_16_ITEM7_P83_S6	In the aggregate, the actual amount paid under these obligations is likely to be higher than the amounts listed as a result of the variable nature of these obligations.
837465_16_ITEM7_P83_S7	In addition, the Company also enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders or other documentation or that are undocumented except for an invoice.
837465_16_ITEM7_P83_S8	Such unconditional purchase obligations are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected in this line item.
837465_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	(4) Amount represents the current and non-current portions of uncertain income tax positions as recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 .
837465_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	Amount excludes uncertain income tax positions that the Company would be able to offset against deferred taxes.

837465_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	During its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions.
837465_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	These include (i) intellectual property indemnities to the Company s customers and licensees in connection with the use, sale and/or license of Company products or trademarks, (ii) indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facilities or leases, (iii) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to the goods or services provided to the Company or based on the negligence or willful misconduct of the Company and (iv) indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts.
837465_16_ITEM7_P85_S2	In addition, the Company has made contractual commitments to each of its officers and certain other employees providing for severance payments upon the termination of employment.
837465_16_ITEM7_P85_S3	The Company also has consulting agreements that provide for payment of nominal fees upon the issuance of patents and/or the commercialization of research results.
837465_16_ITEM7_P85_S4	The Company has also issued guarantees in the form of standby letters of credit in the amount of $ 1.0 million as security for contingent liabilities under certain workers compensation insurance policies.
837465_16_ITEM7_P85_S5	The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases may be indefinite.
837465_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	on the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be obligated to make.
837465_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	Historically, costs incurred to settle claims related to indemnities have not been material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	In addition, the Company believes the likelihood is remote that payments under the commitments and guarantees described above will have a material effect on the Company s financial condition.
837465_16_ITEM7_P87_S2	The fair value of indemnities, commitments and guarantees that the Company issued during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 was not material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_16_ITEM7_P87_S3	In addition to the contractual obligations listed above, the Company s liquidity could also be adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome with respect to claims and litigation that the Company is subject to from time to time.
837465_16_ITEM7_P87_S4	See Note 10 Commitments Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Capital Resources The Company does not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures.
837465_16_ITEM7_P87_S5	The Company has no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K .
837465_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions of its international subsidiaries, including certain balance sheet exposures (payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies) (see Note 16 Derivatives and Hedging in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	In addition, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from the translation of the operating results of the Company s international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	As part of its strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency translation on transactions that are denominated primarily in British Pounds, Euros, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Korean Won.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	For most currencies, the Company is a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefits from a weaker U.S. dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which the Company transacts significant amounts of business.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Foreign currency forward contracts are used only to meet the Company s objectives of offsetting gains and losses from foreign currency exchange exposures with gains and losses from foreign currency contracts in order to reduce foreign currency volatility in earnings.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The extent to which the Company s activities to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates varies is based upon many factors, including the amount of transactions being hedged.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The Company generally only hedges a limited portion of its international transactions.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Foreign currency rates for financial reporting purposes had a negative impact upon the Company s consolidated reported financial results in 2015 compared to 2014 (see Risk Factors contained in Item 1A and Results of Operations contained in Item 7).
837465_16_ITEM7A_P2_S3	The Company does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for speculative purposes.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P2_S4	Foreign currency forward contracts generally mature within 12 to 15 months from their inception.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P2_S5	Beginning in January 2015, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts in the form of cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, to help mitigate the foreign currency exchange exposures discussed above.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P2_S6	The Company did not have instruments that qualified for hedge accounting in 2014 and 2013.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P2_S7	At December 31, 2015 , the notional amount of these contacts was approximately $55.9 million .
837465_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The reporting of gains and losses on these cash flow hedging instruments depends on whether the gains or losses are effective at offsetting changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged items.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The Company uses the hypothetical derivative method to measure the effectiveness of the foreign currency forward contracts and evaluates the effectiveness on a quarterly basis.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	these hedging instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income until recognized in earnings during the period that the hedged transactions take place.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Any ineffective portion of the gains and losses from these hedging instruments is recognized in earnings immediately.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The Company estimates the fair values of foreign currency forward contracts based on pricing models using current market rates.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P6_S1	At December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the notional amounts of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments used to help mitigate the exposure discussed above were approximately $43.1 million , $62.9 million and $42.3 million , respectively.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The Company estimates the fair values of foreign currency forward contracts based on pricing models using current market rates, and records these contracts on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings in other income (expense).
837465_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	As part of the Company s risk management procedure, a sensitivity analysis model is used to measure the potential loss in future earnings of market-sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates or foreign currency values.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The sensitivity analysis model quantifies the estimated potential effect of unfavorable movements of 10% in foreign currencies to which the Company was exposed at December 31, 2015 through its foreign currency forward contracts.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The estimated maximum one-day loss from the Company s foreign currency forward contracts, calculated using the sensitivity analysis model described above, was $10.5 million at December 31, 2015 .
837465_16_ITEM7A_P7_S3	The Company believes that such a hypothetical loss from its foreign currency forward contracts would be partially offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The sensitivity analysis model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in earnings that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P8_S1	It also does not represent the maximum possible loss that may occur.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P8_S2	Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The Company is exposed to interest rate risk from its credit facilities.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Outstanding borrowings under the Company's credit facilities accrue interest as described in Note 3 Financing Arrangements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. As part of the Company s risk management procedures, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of unfavorable changes in interest rates on the Company s cash flows.
837465_16_ITEM7A_P9_S2	The sensitivity analysis quantified that the incremental expense incurred by a 10% increase in interest rates would be $0.2 million over a 12 month period.
837465_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
837465_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act).

837465_16_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

837465_16_ITEM15_P23_S5	All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
837465_16_ITEM15_P24_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
837465_16_ITEM15_P24_S1	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
837465_16_ITEM15_P24_S2	Examples of such estimates include provisions for warranty, uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence, sales returns, tax contingencies, estimates on the valuation of share-based awards and recoverability of long-lived assets and investments.

837465_16_ITEM15_P24_S4	On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its estimates to ensure that these estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business or as new information becomes available.
837465_16_ITEM15_P25_S0	Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.
837465_16_ITEM15_P25_S1	Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged and lessees will no longer be provided with a source of off-balance sheet financing.
837465_16_ITEM15_P25_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
837465_16_ITEM15_P26_S0	Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.
837465_16_ITEM15_P26_S1	The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented.
837465_16_ITEM15_P26_S2	Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach.
837465_16_ITEM15_P26_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.
837465_16_ITEM15_P27_S0	The amendment requires (i) equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, (ii) public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes and (iii) separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables).

837465_16_ITEM15_P29_S2	For public business entities, the amendment is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.

837465_16_ITEM15_P30_S0	Topic 330, Inventory, currently requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market.
837465_16_ITEM15_P30_S1	Market could be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin.
837465_16_ITEM15_P31_S0	The amendments apply to inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost.
837465_16_ITEM15_P31_S1	An entity should measure in-scope inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
837465_16_ITEM15_P31_S2	Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
837465_16_ITEM15_P31_S3	The amendments in this update more closely align the measurement of inventory in GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting Standards.
837465_16_ITEM15_P31_S4	For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
837465_16_ITEM15_P31_S5	The amendments should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.
837465_16_ITEM15_P31_S6	The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.
837465_16_ITEM15_P32_S0	Existing GAAP does not include explicit guidance about a customer s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement.
837465_16_ITEM15_P33_S0	Examples of cloud computing arrangements include: (a) software as a service; (b) platform as a service; (c) infrastructure as a service; and (d) other similar hosting arrangements.
837465_16_ITEM15_P33_S1	The amendments provide guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.
837465_16_ITEM15_P33_S2	If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.
837465_16_ITEM15_P33_S3	If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract.
837465_16_ITEM15_P33_S4	The amendments do not change the customer s accounting for service contracts.
837465_16_ITEM15_P33_S5	As a result of the amendments, all software licenses within the scope of Subtopic 350-40 will be accounted for consistent with other licenses of intangible assets.
837465_16_ITEM15_P33_S6	For public business entities, the amendments will be effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015.
837465_16_ITEM15_P33_S7	The Company does not expect that the adoption of this amendment will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
837465_16_ITEM15_P34_S0	The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
837465_16_ITEM15_P34_S1	The guidance in ASU 2015-03 (see paragraph 835-30-45-1A) does not address presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements.
837465_16_ITEM15_P34_S2	Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, the SEC staff stated that they would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.
837465_16_ITEM15_P34_S3	The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU.
837465_16_ITEM15_P34_S4	The amendments for this ASU are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
837465_16_ITEM15_P34_S5	Early adoption of the amendments is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued.
837465_16_ITEM15_P34_S6	The Company does not expect that the adoption of this amendment will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
837465_16_ITEM15_P35_S0	today in the financial statement footnotes.
837465_16_ITEM15_P35_S1	Until the issuance of this ASU, U.S. GAAP lacked guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures.
837465_16_ITEM15_P35_S2	The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
837465_16_ITEM15_P35_S3	Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued.
837465_16_ITEM15_P35_S4	The Company does not expect that the adoption of this amendment will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
837465_16_ITEM15_P36_S0	This ASU requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition.
837465_16_ITEM15_P36_S1	The performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award.
837465_16_ITEM15_P36_S2	Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered.
837465_16_ITEM15_P36_S3	If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period.
837465_16_ITEM15_P36_S4	The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest.
837465_16_ITEM15_P36_S5	The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved.
837465_16_ITEM15_P36_S6	This ASU is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
837465_16_ITEM15_P36_S7	Based on the Company's evaluation of this ASU, it will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
837465_16_ITEM15_P37_S0	This ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts).
837465_16_ITEM15_P37_S1	This ASU will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, "Revenue Recognition," and most industry-specific guidance.
837465_16_ITEM15_P37_S2	In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer (e.g., assets within the scope of Topic 360, "Property, Plant, and Equipment," and intangible assets within the scope of Topic 350, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other") are amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement (including the constraint on revenue) in this ASU.
837465_16_ITEM15_P38_S0	The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
837465_16_ITEM15_P38_S1	The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
837465_16_ITEM15_P38_S2	Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
837465_16_ITEM15_P38_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
837465_16_ITEM15_P39_S0	Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized, in general, as products are shipped to customers, net of an allowance for sales returns and sales programs in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.
837465_16_ITEM15_P39_S1	In certain cases, the Company recognizes sales when products are received by customers.
837465_16_ITEM15_P39_S2	The criteria for recognition of revenue are met when persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and both title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
837465_16_ITEM15_P40_S0	Sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through of products.
837465_16_ITEM15_P40_S1	The Company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings.
837465_16_ITEM15_P41_S0	Sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program, management s forecast of future product demand, and historical customer participation in similar programs.
837465_16_ITEM15_P42_S0	The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to the Company s allowance for sales returns:
837465_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	Revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed.
837465_16_ITEM15_P43_S1	In addition, the Company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws.
837465_16_ITEM15_P43_S2	The Company s gift cards have no expiration.
837465_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	To determine when redemption is remote, the Company analyzes an aging of unredeemed cards (based on the date the card was last used or the activation date if the card has never been used) and compares that information with historical redemption trends.
837465_16_ITEM15_P44_S1	The deferred revenue associated with outstanding gift cards increased to $1,119,000 at December 31, 2015 from $1,082,000 at December 31, 2014 .
837465_16_ITEM15_P44_S2	The amounts are recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
837465_16_ITEM15_P45_S0	Royalty income is recorded in net sales as underlying product sales occur, subject to certain minimums, in accordance with the related licensing arrangements.
837465_16_ITEM15_P45_S1	The Company recognized royalty income under its various licensing agreements of $8,062,000 , $8,881,000 and $9,130,000 during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
837465_16_ITEM15_P46_S0	Warranty Policy The Company has a stated two-year warranty policy for its golf clubs.
837465_16_ITEM15_P46_S1	The Company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded.
837465_16_ITEM15_P46_S2	In estimating its future warranty obligations, the Company considers various relevant factors, including the Company s stated warranty policies and practices, the historical frequency of claims, and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty.
837465_16_ITEM15_P46_S3	The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to the Company s reserve for warranty expense:
837465_16_ITEM15_P47_S0	Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability (the exit price) in the principal and most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
837465_16_ITEM15_P47_S1	The Company measures and discloses the fair value of nonfinancial and financial assets and liabilities utilizing a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to a fair value measurement are considered to be observable or unobservable in a marketplace.
837465_16_ITEM15_P47_S2	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions.
837465_16_ITEM15_P47_S3	This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.
837465_16_ITEM15_P47_S4	The measurement of assets and liabilities at fair value are classified using the following three-tier hierarchy:
837465_16_ITEM15_P47_S5	Level 1 : Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 : Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and Level 3 :
837465_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	Fair value measurements derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
837465_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	The Company measures fair value using a set of standardized procedures that are outlined herein for all assets and liabilities which are required to be measured at fair value.
837465_16_ITEM15_P49_S1	When available, the Company utilizes quoted market prices from an independent third-party source to determine fair value and classifies such items in Level 1.
837465_16_ITEM15_P49_S2	In some instances where a market price is available, but the instrument is in an inactive or over-the-counter market, the Company consistently applies the dealer (market maker) pricing estimate and uses a midpoint approach on bid and ask prices from financial institutions to determine the reasonableness of these estimates.
837465_16_ITEM15_P49_S3	Assets and liabilities subject to this fair value valuation approach are typically classified as Level 2.
837465_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	Items valued using internally-generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
837465_16_ITEM15_P50_S1	As a result, the asset or liability could be classified in either Level 2 or Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.
837465_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow valuation model whenever applicable to derive a fair value measurement on long-lived assets and goodwill and intangible assets.
837465_16_ITEM15_P51_S1	The Company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate.
837465_16_ITEM15_P51_S2	The Company also considers its counterparty s and own credit risk on derivatives and other liabilities measured at their fair value.
837465_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	Advertising Costs The Company's primary advertising costs are from television and print media advertisements.
837465_16_ITEM15_P52_S1	The Company s policy is to expense advertising costs, including production costs, as incurred.
837465_16_ITEM15_P52_S2	Advertising expenses for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were $57,392,000 , $55,502,000 and $53,707,000 , respectively.
837465_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
837465_16_ITEM15_P53_S1	Research and development costs for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were $33,213,000 , $ 31,285,000 and $ 30,937,000 , respectively.
837465_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions A significant portion of the Company s business is conducted outside of the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
837465_16_ITEM15_P54_S1	As a result, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on the Company s financial results.
837465_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	Revenues and expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the average exchange rate for the period.
837465_16_ITEM15_P55_S1	Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date.
837465_16_ITEM15_P55_S2	Gains and losses from assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity on which they reside are generally recognized currently in the Company's statements of operations.
837465_16_ITEM15_P55_S3	Gains and losses from the translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (see Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income policy below).
837465_16_ITEM15_P55_S4	The Company recorded a net loss in foreign currency transactions of $1,611,000 , $6,198,000 and $821,000 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
837465_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	Derivatives and Hedging In order to mitigate the impact of foreign currency translation on transactions, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts that are accounted for as non-designated and designated hedges pursuant to ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ("ASC Topic 815").
837465_16_ITEM15_P56_S1	ASC Topic 815 requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, measure those instruments at fair value and recognize changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change unless the derivative qualifies as designated cash flow hedge that offsets certain exposures.
837465_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	Certain criteria must be satisfied in order for derivative financial instruments to be classified and accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
837465_16_ITEM15_P57_S1	Gains and losses from the remeasurement of qualifying cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and released into earnings as a component of cost of goods sold or net sales during the period in which the hedged transaction takes place.
837465_16_ITEM15_P57_S2	Gains and losses on the ineffective portion of hedges (hedges that do not meet accounting requirements due to ineffectiveness) and derivatives that are not elected for hedge accounting treatment are immediately recorded in earnings as a component of other income (expense).
837465_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less.
837465_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	The Company records its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.
837465_16_ITEM15_P59_S1	This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts.
837465_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	An estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, the customer s financial condition and current economic trends, all of which are subject to change.
837465_16_ITEM15_P60_S1	Actual uncollected amounts have historically been consistent with the Company s expectations.
837465_16_ITEM15_P60_S2	The decrease in the allowance for estimated losses as of December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of a significant bad debt recovery recognized in 2015.
837465_16_ITEM15_P60_S3	The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to the Company s allowance for doubtful accounts:
837465_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value.
837465_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
837465_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	The inventory balance, which includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs, is recorded net of an estimate for obsolete or unmarketable inventory.
837465_16_ITEM15_P63_S1	This estimate is based upon current inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience as well as management s estimates of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand, all of which are subject to change.
837465_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
837465_16_ITEM15_P65_S0	Normal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
837465_16_ITEM15_P65_S1	Expenditures that materially increase values, change capacities or extend useful lives are capitalized.
837465_16_ITEM15_P65_S2	The related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income/(loss).
837465_16_ITEM15_P66_S0	Construction in-process consists primarily of costs associated with building improvements, machinery and equipment that have not yet been placed into service, unfinished molds as well as in-process internally developed software.
837465_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 350-40, Internal-Use Software, the Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal use software.
837465_16_ITEM15_P67_S1	Costs incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed.
837465_16_ITEM15_P67_S2	All direct external costs incurred to develop internal-use software during the development stage are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful lives.
837465_16_ITEM15_P67_S3	Costs such as maintenance and training are expensed as incurred.
837465_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-5, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , the Company assesses potential impairments of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying value may not be recoverable.
837465_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	An impairment charge would be recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.
837465_16_ITEM15_P68_S2	The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group.
837465_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets, which consist of trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, patents and other intangible assets, were acquired in connection with the acquisition of Odyssey Sports, Inc. in 1997, FrogTrader, Inc. in 2004, and certain foreign distributors.
837465_16_ITEM15_P70_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events indicate that an impairment exists.
837465_16_ITEM15_P70_S1	The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets over their estimated fair value.
837465_16_ITEM15_P70_S2	If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded.
837465_16_ITEM15_P70_S3	To determine fair value, the Company uses its internal discounted cash flow estimates, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals when appropriate.
837465_16_ITEM15_P70_S4	The Company completed its annual impairment test and fair value analysis of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2015 , and the estimated fair values of the Company s reporting units in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Korea, as well as the estimated fair values of certain trade names and trademarks, exceeded their carrying values.
837465_16_ITEM15_P70_S5	As a result, no impairment was recorded as of December 31, 2015 .
837465_16_ITEM15_P71_S0	Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-5 discussed above.
837465_16_ITEM15_P71_S1	See Note 6 for further discussion of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets.
837465_16_ITEM15_P72_S0	Investments The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of acquisition and reevaluates such classification at each balance sheet date.
837465_16_ITEM15_P72_S1	Investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are stated at cost.
837465_16_ITEM15_P72_S2	The Company monitors investments for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 325-35-2, Impairment and ASC Topic 320-35-17 through 35-35, Scope of Impairment Guidance.
837465_16_ITEM15_P72_S3	See Note 7 for further discussion of the Company s investments.
837465_16_ITEM15_P73_S0	The Company accounts for its share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ( ASC Topic 718 ), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and non-employees based on estimated fair values.
837465_16_ITEM15_P73_S1	ASC Topic 718 further requires a reduction in share-based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_16_ITEM15_P74_S0	The forfeiture rate used by the Company is based on historical forfeiture trends.
837465_16_ITEM15_P74_S1	If actual forfeiture rates are not consistent with the Company s estimates, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods.
837465_16_ITEM15_P75_S0	Performance share units are stock-based awards in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on the Company's performance against specified goals that are measured over a designated performance period from the date of grant.
837465_16_ITEM15_P75_S1	These performance goals are established by the Company at the beginning of the performance period.
837465_16_ITEM15_P75_S2	At the end of the performance period, the number of shares of stock that could be issued is fixed based upon the degree of achievement of the performance goals.
837465_16_ITEM15_P75_S3	The number of shares that could be issued can range from 50% to 150% of the participant's target award.
837465_16_ITEM15_P76_S0	Performance share units are initially valued at the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant.
837465_16_ITEM15_P76_S1	Compensation expense for performance share units is recognized over the vesting period and is reduced by an estimate for forfeitures, and will vary based on remeasurements during the performance period.
837465_16_ITEM15_P76_S2	If the performance goals are not probable of achievement during the performance period, compensation expense would be reversed.
837465_16_ITEM15_P76_S3	The awards are forfeited if the performance goals are not achieved as of the end of the performance period.
837465_16_ITEM15_P77_S0	The performance units vest in full at the end of a three year period.
837465_16_ITEM15_P78_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options and stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) at the date of grant.
837465_16_ITEM15_P78_S1	The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions to calculate the value of stock options/SARs.
837465_16_ITEM15_P78_S2	The Company uses historical data among other information to estimate the expected price volatility, expected term and forfeiture rate.

837465_16_ITEM15_P118_S1	The new accounting guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016 and interim periods therein.
837465_16_ITEM15_P118_S2	Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of interim or annual reporting periods.
837465_16_ITEM15_P118_S3	The Company has adopted the standard prospectively as of December 31, 2015 and no adjustment was made to prior periods.
837465_16_ITEM15_P119_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities of prior periods are classified as current or noncurrent according to the classification of the related asset or liability.

837465_16_ITEM15_P121_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are anticipated to be in effect at the time the differences are expected to reverse.
837465_16_ITEM15_P121_S1	The realization of the deferred tax assets, including the loss and credit carry forwards listed above, is subject to the Company generating sufficient taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become realizable.
837465_16_ITEM15_P121_S2	In accordance with the applicable accounting rules, the Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
837465_16_ITEM15_P121_S3	In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire.
837465_16_ITEM15_P121_S4	These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment, including estimates of future taxable income.
837465_16_ITEM15_P121_S5	These estimates are based on the Company s best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions.
837465_16_ITEM15_P121_S6	In 2011, the Company established a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets and discontinued recognizing income tax benefits related to its U.S. net operating losses.

837465_16_ITEM15_P122_S1	Prospectively, the Company would then report an effective U.S. income tax rate that is closer to its statutory rates.
837465_16_ITEM15_P122_S2	The Company's valuation allowance does not preclude the Company from using net operating loss carry forwards or other deferred tax assets in the future, except as described below.
837465_16_ITEM15_P122_S3	Until the Company re-establishes a pattern of continuing profitability, in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, U.S. income tax expense or benefit related to the recognition of deferred tax assets in the consolidated statement of operations for future periods will be offset by decreases or increases in the valuation allowance with no net effect on the consolidated statement of operations.
837465_16_ITEM15_P122_S4	The Company has concluded that with respect to non-U.S. entities, there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that realization of its deferred tax assets is more likely than not under applicable accounting rules, and no significant allowances have been established.
837465_16_ITEM15_P122_S5	At December 31, 2015 , the Company had federal and state income tax credit carryforwards of $15,136,000 and $11,994,000 , respectively, which will expire at various dates beginning in 2020 .

837465_16_ITEM15_P124_S0	Although the Company has set up a valuation allowance against the majority of its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carry forwards, other losses and credit carryforwards, such allowance does not preclude the Company from using the deferred tax assets in the future.
837465_16_ITEM15_P124_S1	However, the Company s ability to utilize the losses and credits to offset future taxable income may be deferred or limited significantly if the Company were to experience an ownership change as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
837465_16_ITEM15_P124_S2	In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in ownership of the Company s stock by 5-percent shareholders (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.

837465_16_ITEM15_P127_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , the gross liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax benefits was $7,090,000 .
837465_16_ITEM15_P127_S1	This liability could be reduced by $1,368,000 of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, which was recorded as a long-term income tax receivable, as well as $4,674,000 of deferred taxes.
837465_16_ITEM15_P127_S2	The net amount of $1,048,000 , if recognized, would affect the Company s financial statements and favorably affect the Company s effective income tax rate.
837465_16_ITEM15_P127_S3	The Company does expect changes to the unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months; however, the Company does not expect the changes to have a material impact on its results of operations or its financial position.

837465_16_ITEM15_P130_S1	Upon remittance, certain foreign countries impose withholding taxes, subject to certain limitations, for use as credits against the Company s U.S. tax liability, if any.
837465_16_ITEM15_P130_S2	If the foreign earnings were remitted, the Company does not anticipate a material impact to the Company's federal or state income taxes due to the Company's available net operating losses and credits.
837465_16_ITEM15_P130_S3	The Company estimates that it would have withholding taxes of $1,125,000 upon remittance.
837465_16_ITEM15_P130_S4	In 2015 and 2014, the Company ceased its business operations in Thailand and Malaysia, respectively, and accordingly, the Company no longer maintains a permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to these two entities.
837465_16_ITEM15_P130_S5	The Company intends to repatriate the undistributed earnings from these two entities to the United States at the time that the winding-down process has been completed.
837465_16_ITEM15_P130_S6	As of December 31, 2015, the Company has accrued for the estimated incremental U.S. income taxes related to reversing its permanent indefinite reinvestment assertion.
837465_16_ITEM15_P130_S7	However, these incremental U.S. income taxes are expected to be offset by the utilization of the Company's cumulative U.S. net operating losses incurred through December 31, 2015.

837465_16_ITEM15_P131_S2	One or more such claims of potential infringement could lead to litigation, the need to obtain licenses, the need to alter a product to avoid infringement, a settlement or judgment or some other action or material loss by the Company, which also could adversely affect the Company s overall ability to protect its product designs and ultimately limit its future success in the marketplace.
837465_16_ITEM15_P131_S3	In addition, the Company is occasionally subject to non-routine claims, proceedings or investigations.
837465_16_ITEM15_P131_S4	The Company regularly assesses such matters to determine the degree of probability that the Company will incur a material loss as a result of such matters as well as the range of possible loss.

837465_16_ITEM15_P133_S0	Historically, the claims, proceedings and investigations brought against the Company, individually and in the aggregate, have not had a material adverse effect upon the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company.

837465_16_ITEM15_P133_S2	These matters are inherently unpredictable and the resolutions of these matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcomes are not predictable with assurance.
837465_16_ITEM15_P133_S3	Consequently, management is unable to estimate the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary loss, amounts covered by insurance or the financial impact that will result from such matters.
837465_16_ITEM15_P133_S4	Management believes that the final resolution of the current matters pending against the Company, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company s consolidated financial position.

837465_16_ITEM15_P139_S0	Historically, costs incurred to settle claims related to indemnities have not been material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_16_ITEM15_P139_S1	In addition, the Company believes the likelihood is remote that payments under the commitments and guarantees described above will have a material effect on the Company s financial condition.

837465_16_ITEM15_P154_S4	The valuation model applied in this calculation utilizes highly subjective assumptions that could potentially change over time.
837465_16_ITEM15_P154_S5	Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option.
837465_16_ITEM15_P154_S6	Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by the employee holding the option.

837465_16_ITEM15_P174_S0	The Company measures certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at least annually or when certain indicators are present.
837465_16_ITEM15_P174_S1	These assets include long-lived assets, goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets that are written down to fair value when they are held for sale or determined to be impaired.
837465_16_ITEM15_P174_S2	In 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company did not recognize any impairment losses on these assets.
837465_16_ITEM15_P175_S0	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, trade payables and accrued expenses at December 31, 2015 and 2014 are reasonable estimates of fair value due to the short-term nature of these balances and are therefore classified as Level 1.

837465_16_ITEM15_P178_S2	The Company accounts for its foreign currency forward contracts in accordance with ASC Topic 815.
837465_16_ITEM15_P178_S3	ASC Topic 815 requires the recognition of all derivatives instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, the measurement of those instruments at fair value and the recognition of changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change, unless the derivative qualifies as a designated cash flow hedge that offsets certain exposures.
837465_16_ITEM15_P178_S4	Certain criteria must be satisfied in order for derivative financial instruments to be classified and accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
837465_16_ITEM15_P178_S5	Gains and losses from the remeasurement of qualifying hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and released into earnings as a component of cost of goods sold or net sales during the period in which the hedged transaction takes place.
837465_16_ITEM15_P178_S6	Gains and losses on the ineffective portion of hedges (hedges that do not meet accounting requirements due to ineffectiveness) and derivatives that are not elected for hedge accounting treatment are immediately recorded in earnings as a component of other income (expense).
837465_16_ITEM15_P179_S0	Foreign currency forward contracts are used only to meet the Company s objectives of minimizing variability in the Company s operating results arising from foreign exchange rate movements.
837465_16_ITEM15_P179_S1	The Company does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for speculative purposes.
837465_16_ITEM15_P179_S2	The Company utilizes counterparties for its derivative instruments that it believes are credit-worthy at the time the transactions are entered into and the Company closely monitors the credit ratings of these counterparties.
837465_16_ITEM15_P180_S0	The following table summarizes the fair value of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts as well as the location of the asset and/or liability on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):

837465_16_ITEM15_P185_S4	The reporting of gains and losses on these cash flow hedging instruments depends on whether the gains or losses are effective at offsetting changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged items.
837465_16_ITEM15_P186_S0	The Company uses the hypothetical derivative method to measure the effectiveness of the foreign currency forward contracts and evaluates the effectiveness on a quarterly basis.
837465_16_ITEM15_P187_S0	The effective portion of the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income until recognized in earnings during the period that the hedged transactions take place.
837465_16_ITEM15_P187_S1	Any ineffective portion of the gains and losses from the hedging instruments is recognized in earnings immediately.
837465_16_ITEM15_P188_S0	The Company would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if (i) it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item, (ii) when the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, (iii) if it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction being hedged by the derivative will not occur, (iv) if a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment, or (v) if it is determined that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate.
837465_16_ITEM15_P189_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its foreign currency forward contracts based on pricing models using current market rates.

837465_16_ITEM15_P189_S4	In addition, the Company recognized $1,149,000 in other income (expense) as a result of hedge ineffectiveness, of which $576,000 was reclassified from other comprehensive income for hedges that no longer met the accounting requirements.
837465_16_ITEM15_P189_S5	Forward points were expensed as incurred.
837465_16_ITEM15_P189_S6	Based on the current valuation, the Company expects to reclassify net gains of $525,000 from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net earnings during the next 12 months.

837465_17_ITEM1_P30_S13	The Company believes that it is a technological leader in the golf ball category.
837465_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	For both golf clubs and golf balls, the Company generally competes on the basis of technology, quality, performance, customer service and price.
837465_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	In order to gauge the effectiveness of the Company s response to such factors, management receives and evaluates Company-generated market trends for U.S. and foreign markets, as well as periodic public and customized market research for the U.S. and U.K. markets from Golf Datatech that include trends from certain on- and off-course retailers.
837465_17_ITEM1_P31_S2	In addition, the Company utilizes GfK Group for the markets in Japan.
837465_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	In most of the regions where the Company does business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis.
837465_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	Weather conditions in most parts of the world generally restrict golf from being played year-round, with many of the Company s on-course customers closing during the cold weather months.
837465_17_ITEM1_P32_S2	The Company s business is therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_17_ITEM1_P32_S3	In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season.
837465_17_ITEM1_P32_S4	This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter.
837465_17_ITEM1_P32_S5	The Company s second-quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter.
837465_17_ITEM1_P32_S6	The Company s third-quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but are generally less than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season.
837465_17_ITEM1_P32_S7	The Company s fourth-quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company s key markets.
837465_17_ITEM1_P32_S8	However, third-quarter sales can be affected by a mid-year launch of product, and fourth-quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year.
837465_17_ITEM1_P32_S9	This seasonality, and therefore quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as well as weather conditions.
837465_17_ITEM1_P32_S10	In general, however, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company s sales and most, if not all, of its profitability generally occurs during the first half of the year.
837465_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	The Company s operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of certain materials, substances and wastes and the remediation of environmental contaminants (collectively, Environmental Laws ).

837465_17_ITEM1_P33_S2	In addition, in connection with the Company's Top-Flite asset acquisition in 2003, the Company assumed certain monitoring and remediation obligations at its manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts.
837465_17_ITEM1_P33_S3	In February 2013, the Company sold this facility and leased back a reduced portion of the square footage that it believes is adequate for its ongoing golf ball manufacturing operations.
837465_17_ITEM1_P33_S4	As part of the terms of this sale, the Company assumed certain ongoing environmental remediation obligations.
837465_17_ITEM1_P33_S5	The Company endeavors to adhere to all applicable Environmental Laws and takes action as necessary to comply with these laws.
837465_17_ITEM1_P33_S6	The Company maintains an environmental and safety program and employs full-time environmental, health and safety professionals at its facilities located in Carlsbad, California, Chicopee, Massachusetts and Monterrey, Mexico.
837465_17_ITEM1_P33_S7	The environmental and safety program includes obtaining environmental permits as required, capturing and appropriately disposing of any waste by-products, tracking hazardous waste generation and disposal, air emissions, safety situations, material safety data sheet management, storm water management and recycling, and auditing and reporting on its compliance.
837465_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	Historically, the costs of environmental compliance have not had a material adverse effect on the Company s business.
837465_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	The Company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws.
837465_17_ITEM1_P34_S2	Sustainability The Company believes it is important to conduct its business in an environmentally, economically and socially sustainable manner.

837465_17_ITEM1_P35_S3	Information on both of these programs is available on the Company s website www.callawaygolf.com.

837465_17_ITEM1_P59_S6	These reports can be accessed free of charge from the Company s website as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such materials with, or furnishes them to the Commission.
837465_17_ITEM1_P59_S7	In addition, the Company s Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Conduct and the written charters of the committees of the Board of Directors are available in the Corporate Governance portion of the Investor Relations section of the Company s website and are available in print to any shareholder who requests a copy.
837465_17_ITEM1_P59_S8	The information contained on the Company s website shall not be deemed to be incorporated into this report.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The Company s business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The Company urges you to carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those risks set forth under the heading entitled Important Notice to Investors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, and in other documents that the Company files with the Commission, before making any investment decision with respect to the Company s securities.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop, the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Under these circumstances, the trading prices of the Company s securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in the Company s securities.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Any significant changes in U.S trade, tax or other policies that restrict imports or increase import tariffs could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	A significant amount of the Company s products are manufactured outside of the United States.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The new Presidential administration has called for substantial changes to U.S. trade and tax policies, which may include import restrictions or increased import tariffs.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Restrictions on imports could prevent or make it difficult for the Company to obtain the components needed for new products which would affect the Company s sales.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Increased tariffs would require the Company to increase its prices which likely would decrease customer and consumer demand for its products.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Other countries might retaliate through the imposition of their own restrictions and or increased tariffs which would affect the Company s ability to export products and therefore adversely affect its sales.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Any significant changes in current U.S. trade, tax or other policies could have a material adverse effect upon the Company s results of operations.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Significant developments stemming from the recent U.K. referendum on membership in the EU could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the European Union, (the "EU").
837465_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	This referendum has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the United Kingdom and the EU, and this uncertainty may last for years.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The Company's business in the United Kingdom, the EU, and worldwide could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact of the United Kingdom s referendum.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	The referendum, and the likely withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU it triggers, has caused and, along with events that could occur in the future as a consequence of the United Kingdom s withdrawal, including the possible breakup of the United Kingdom, may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets, including in global currency and debt markets.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	This volatility could cause a slowdown in economic activity in the United Kingdom, Europe or globally, which could adversely affect the Company's operating results and growth prospects, or result in a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar which would also adversely affect the Company's reported operating results.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The Company has significant international operations and is exposed to risks associated with doing business globally.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The Company sells and distributes its products directly in many key international markets in Europe, Asia, North America and elsewhere around the world.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	These activities have resulted and will continue to result in investments in inventory, accounts receivable, employees, corporate infrastructure and facilities.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition, there are a limited number of suppliers of golf club components in the United States, and the Company has increasingly become more reliant on suppliers and vendors located outside of the United States.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P5_S4	The operation of foreign distribution in the Company s international markets, as well as the management of relationships with international suppliers and vendors, will continue to require the dedication of management and other Company resources.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Company manufactures most of its products outside of the United States.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	As a result of this international business, the Company is exposed to increased risks inherent in conducting business outside of the United States.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In addition to foreign currency risks, these risks include:
837465_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Increased exposure to interruptions in air carrier or ship services.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Any significant adverse change in circumstances or conditions could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Any difficulties from strategic acquisitions that the Company pursues or consummates, including its recent acquisition of OGIO, could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The Company may acquire companies, businesses and products that complement or augment its existing business.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	For example, in January 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of OGIO.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The Company may not be able to integrate OGIO or any other business that it may acquire successfully or operate OGIO or any other such acquired business profitably.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Integrating any newly acquired business could be expensive and time-consuming.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Integration efforts often take a significant amount of time, place a significant strain on managerial, operational and financial resources and could prove to be more difficult or expensive than predicted.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P9_S5	The diversion of management's attention and any delay or difficulties encountered in connection with any future acquisitions the Company may consummate could result in the disruption of on-going business or inconsistencies in standards and controls that could negatively affect the Company s ability to maintain third-party relationships.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Moreover, the Company may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing, or issue additional shares, to acquire any businesses or products, which may result in dilution for stockholders or the incurrence of indebtedness.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	As part of the Company s efforts to acquire companies, business or products or to enter into other significant transactions, the Company conducts business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in the transaction.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Despite the Company s efforts, the Company ultimately may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks and, as a result, might not realize the intended advantages of the transaction.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If the Company fails to realize the expected benefits from the OGIO acquisition or other acquisitions it may consummate in the future or have consummated in the past, whether as a result of unidentified risks, integration difficulties, litigation with current or former employees and other events, the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Unfavorable economic conditions could have a negative impact on consumer discretionary spending and therefore negatively impact the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The Company sells golf clubs, golf balls and golf accessories.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	These products are recreational in nature and are therefore discretionary purchases for consumers.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases of golf products during favorable economic conditions and when consumers are feeling confident and prosperous.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Discretionary spending is also affected by many other factors, including general business conditions, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxes and consumer confidence in future economic conditions.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Purchases of the Company s products could decline during periods when disposable income is lower, or during periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P11_S5	A significant or prolonged decline in general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that adversely affect consumer discretionary spending, whether in the United States or in the Company s international markets, could result in reduced sales of the Company s products, which in turn would have a negative impact on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P11_S6	A severe or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect the Company's customers financial condition, their levels of business activity and their ability to pay trade obligations.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The Company primarily sells its products to golf equipment retailers directly and through wholly-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries, and to foreign distributors.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally requires no collateral from these customers.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	However, a severe or prolonged downturn in the general economy could adversely affect the retail golf equipment market which in turn, would negatively impact the liquidity and cash flows of the Company's customers, including the ability of such customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the Company's products and to pay their trade obligations.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P12_S3	This could result in increased delinquent or uncollectible accounts for some of the Company s customers.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P12_S4	A failure by the Company s customers to pay on a timely basis a significant portion of outstanding account receivable balances would adversely impact the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P12_S5	The Company has significant international sales and purchases, and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a significant negative impact on the Company s results of operations.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	A significant portion of the Company s purchases and sales is international, and the Company conducts transactions in various currencies worldwide.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Conducting business in such currencies exposes the Company to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The Company s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, and as a result, transactions conducted in foreign currencies must be translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes based upon the applicable foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	in these foreign currency exchange rates therefore may positively or negatively affect the Company s reported financial results and can significantly affect period-over-period comparisons.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The effect of the translation of foreign currencies on the Company s financial results can be significant.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The Company therefore engages in certain hedging activities to mitigate over time the impact of the translation of foreign currencies on the Company s financial results.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The Company s hedging activities can reduce, but will not eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	The extent to which the Company s hedging activities mitigate the effects of foreign currency translation varies based upon many factors, including the amount of transactions being hedged.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Other factors that could affect the effectiveness of the Company s hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts, volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Since the hedging activities are designed to reduce volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar but also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Company s future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts business.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Foreign currency fluctuations can also affect the prices at which products are sold in the Company s international markets.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The Company therefore adjusts its pricing based in part upon fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Significant unanticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates make it more difficult for the Company to manage pricing in its international markets.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P16_S4	If the Company is unable to adjust its pricing in a timely manner to counteract the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, the Company s pricing may not be competitive in the marketplace and the Company s financial results in its international markets could be adversely affected.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P16_S5	The Company s obligations and certain financial covenants contained under its existing credit facilities expose it to risks that could materially and adversely affect its liquidity, business, operating results, financial condition and ability to make any dividend or other payments on its capital stock.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Company s primary credit facility is a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (as amended, the ABL Facility ), comprised of a U.S. facility, a Canadian facility and a United Kingdom facility, in each case subject to borrowing base availability under the applicable facility.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are secured by certain assets, including cash (to the extent pledged by the Company), inventory and accounts receivable, of the Company s subsidiaries in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The maximum availability under the ABL Facility fluctuates with the general seasonality of the business, and increases and decreases with the changes in the Company's inventory and account receivable balances.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	The ABL Facility includes certain restrictions including, among other things, restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, liens, dividends, stock repurchases and other restricted payments, asset sales, investments, mergers, acquisitions and affiliate transactions.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Additionally, the Company is subject to compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant during, and continuing 30 days after, any period in which the Company s borrowing base availability falls below $23.0 million.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P17_S5	If the Company experiences a decline in revenues or adjusted EBITDA, the Company may have difficulty paying interest and principal amounts due on its ABL Facility or other indebtedness and meeting certain of the financial covenants contained in the ABL Facility.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P17_S6	If the Company is unable to make required payments under the ABL Facility, or if the Company fails to comply with the various covenants and other requirements of the ABL Facility or other indebtedness, the Company would be in default thereunder, which would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate the maturity thereof.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P17_S7	Any default under the ABL Facility or other indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s liquidity, business, operating results and financial condition and ability to make any dividend or other payments on the Company s capital stock.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P17_S8	See Note 3 Financing Arrangements , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the terms of the ABL Facility and the Company's Japan ABL Facility.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The Company s ability to generate sufficient positive cash flows from operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including future economic trends and conditions, the success of the Company s multi-year turnaround, demand for the Company s products, foreign currency exchange rates and other risks and uncertainties applicable to the Company and its business.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to generate sufficient operating cash flows in the future or maintain or grow its existing cash balances.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows to fund its business due to a further decline in sales or otherwise and is unable to reduce its manufacturing costs and operating expenses to offset such decline, the Company will need to increase its reliance on its credit facilities for needed liquidity.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	If its credit facilities are not then available or sufficient and the Company is not able to secure alternative financing arrangements, the Company s future operations would be materially, adversely affected.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Unauthorized access to, or accidental disclosure of, consumer personally-identifiable information including credit card information, that the Company collects through its websites may result in significant expenses and negatively impact the Company's reputation and business.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	There is heightened concern and awareness over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	While the Company has implemented security measures, the Company s computer systems may be susceptible to electronic or physical computer break-ins, viruses and other disruptions and security breaches.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Any perceived or actual unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of personally-identifiable information regarding visitors to the Company s websites or otherwise, whether through a breach of the Company s network by an unauthorized party, employee theft, misuse or error or otherwise, could harm the Company s reputation, impair the Company s ability to attract website visitors, or subject the Company to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by consumers, and adversely affect the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	If the Company is unable to successfully manage the frequent introduction of new products that satisfy changing consumer preferences, it could significantly and adversely impact its financial performance and prospects for future growth.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The Company s main products, like those of its competitors, generally have life cycles of two years or less, with sales occurring at a much higher rate in the first year than in the second.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Factors driving these short product life cycles include the rapid introduction of competitive products and consumer demands for the latest technology.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In this marketplace, a substantial portion of the Company s annual revenues is generated each year by products that are in their first year of their product life cycle.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	These marketplace conditions raise a number of issues that the Company must successfully manage.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	For example, the Company must properly anticipate consumer preferences and design products that meet those preferences while also complying with significant restrictions imposed by the Rules of Golf (see further discussion of the Rules of Golf below) or its new products will not achieve sufficient market success to compensate for the usual decline in sales experienced by products already in the market.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Second, the Company s research and development and supply chain groups face constant pressures to design, develop, source and supply new products that perform better than their predecessors many of which incorporate new or otherwise untested technology, suppliers or inputs.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Third, for new products to generate equivalent or greater revenues than their predecessors, they must either maintain the same or higher sales levels with the same or higher pricing, or exceed the performance of their predecessors in one or both of those areas.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Fourth, the relatively short window of opportunity for launching and selling new products requires great precision in forecasting demand and assuring that supplies are ready and delivered during the critical selling periods.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Finally, the rapid changeover in products creates a need to monitor and manage the closeout of older products both at retail and in the Company s own inventory.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Should the Company not successfully manage the frequent introduction of new products that satisfy consumer demand, the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be significantly adversely affected.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P22_S8	A reduction in the number of rounds of golf played or in the number of golf participants could adversely affect the Company s sales.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The Company generates substantially all of its revenues from the sale of golf-related products, including golf clubs, golf balls and golf accessories.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The demand for golf-related products in general, and golf balls in particular, is directly related to the number of golf participants and the number of rounds of golf being played by these participants.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If golf participation continues to decrease or the number of rounds of golf played decreases, sales of the Company s products may be adversely affected.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In the future, the overall dollar volume of the market for golf-related products may not grow or may decline.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	In addition, the demand for golf products is also directly related to the popularity of magazines, cable channels and other media dedicated to golf, television coverage of golf tournaments and attendance at golf events.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P23_S5	The Company depends on the exposure of its products through advertising and the media or at golf tournaments and events.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Any significant reduction in television coverage of, or attendance at, golf tournaments and events or any significant reduction in the popularity of golf magazines or golf television channels, could reduce the visibility of the Company s brand and could adversely affect the Company s sales.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P23_S7	The Company may have limited opportunities for future growth in sales of golf clubs and golf balls.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P23_S8	In order for the Company to significantly grow its sales of golf clubs or golf balls, the Company must either increase its share of the market for golf clubs or golf balls, or the market for golf clubs or golf balls must grow.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P23_S9	The Company already has a significant share of worldwide sales of golf clubs and golf balls and the golf industry is very competitive.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P23_S10	As such, gaining incremental market share quickly or at all is difficult.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P23_S11	Therefore, opportunities for additional market share may be limited given the challenging competitive nature of the golf industry, and the overall dollar volume of worldwide sales of golf clubs or golf balls may not grow or may decline.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	If the Company inaccurately forecasts demand for its products, it may manufacture either insufficient or excess quantities, which, in either case, could adversely affect its financial performance.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The Company plans its manufacturing capacity based upon the forecasted demand for its products.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Forecasting the demand for the Company's products is very difficult given the manufacturing lead time and the amount of specification involved.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	For example, the Company must forecast well in advance not only how many drivers it will sell, but also (1) the quantity of each driver model, (2) the quantity of the different lofts in each driver model, and (3) for each driver model and loft, the number of left handed and right handed versions.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The nature of the Company s business makes it difficult to adjust quickly its manufacturing capacity if actual demand for its products exceeds or is less than forecasted demand.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If actual demand for its products exceeds the forecasted demand, the Company may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of new products in time to fulfill actual demand, which could limit the Company s sales and adversely affect its financial performance.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	On the other hand, if actual demand is less than the forecasted demand for its products, the Company could produce excess quantities, resulting in excess inventories and related obsolescence charges that could adversely affect the Company s financial performance.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P25_S3	The Company depends on single source or a limited number of suppliers for some of its products, and the loss of any of these suppliers could harm its business.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The Company is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for its clubheads and shafts, some of which are single sourced.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Furthermore, some of the Company s products require specially developed manufacturing techniques and processes which make it difficult to identify and utilize alternative suppliers quickly.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In addition, many of the Company s suppliers are not well capitalized and prolonged unfavorable economic conditions could increase the risk that they will go out of business.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	If current suppliers are unable to deliver clubheads, shafts or other components, or if the Company is required to transition to other suppliers, the Company could experience significant production delays or disruption to its business.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	The Company also depends on a single or a limited number of suppliers for the materials it uses to make its golf balls.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Many of these materials are customized for the Company.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Any delay or interruption in such supplies could have a material adverse impact on the Company s golf ball business.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P26_S7	If the Company experiences any such delays or interruptions, the Company may not be able to find adequate alternative suppliers at a reasonable cost or without significant disruption to its business.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P26_S8	A significant disruption in the operations of the Company s golf club assembly and golf ball manufacturing and assembly facilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company s sales, profitability and results of operations.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	A significant disruption at any of the Company s golf club or golf ball manufacturing facilities or distribution centers in the United States or in regions outside the United States could materially and adversely affect the Company s sales, profitability and results of operations.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Regulations related to conflict minerals require the Company to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing the Company s products.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The Commission's rules require disclosure related to sourcing of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The rules require companies to, under specified circumstances, undertake due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The Company s products may contain some of the specified minerals.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P28_S3	As a result, the Company will incur additional expenses in connection with complying with the rules, including with respect to any due diligence that is required under the rules.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P28_S4	In addition, the Commission's implementation of the rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company s products.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P28_S5	There may only be a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free conflict minerals, and the Company cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain necessary conflict free conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P28_S6	Because the Company s supply chain is complex, the Company may also not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in the Company s products through the due diligence procedures that the Company implements, which may harm the Company s reputation.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P28_S7	A disruption in the service or a significant increase in the cost of the Company s primary delivery and shipping services for its products and component parts or a significant disruption at shipping ports could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The Company uses United Parcel Service ( UPS ) for substantially all ground shipments of products to its U.S. customers.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The Company uses air carriers and ocean shipping services for most of its international shipments of products.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Furthermore, many of the components the Company uses to build its golf clubs, including clubheads and shafts, are shipped to the Company via air carrier and ship services.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Company may be unable to engage alternative suppliers or to receive or ship goods through alternate sites in order to deliver its products or components in a timely and cost-efficient manner.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	As a result, the Company could experience manufacturing delays, increased manufacturing and shipping costs and lost sales as a result of missed delivery deadlines and product demand cycles.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Any significant interruption in UPS services, air carrier services, ship services or at airports or shipping ports could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Furthermore, if the cost of delivery or shipping services were to increase significantly and the additional costs could not be covered by product pricing, the Company s operating results could be materially adversely affected.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The Company faces intense competition in each of its markets and if it is unable to maintain a competitive advantage, loss of market share, revenue, or profitability may result.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The golf club business is highly competitive, and is served by a number of well-established and well-financed companies with recognized brand names.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	New product introductions, price reductions, consignment sales, extended payment terms, closeouts, including closeouts of products that were recently commercially successful, and significant tour and advertising spending by competitors continue to generate intense market competition.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Furthermore, continued downward pressure on pricing in the market for new clubs could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s pre-owned club business as the gap narrows between the cost of a new club and a pre-owned club.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Successful marketing activities, discounted pricing, consignment sales, extended payment terms or new product introductions by competitors could negatively impact the Company s future sales.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The golf ball business is also highly competitive.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	There are a number of well-established and well-financed competitors, including one competitor with an estimated U.S. market share of over 50%.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The Company s competitors continue to incur significant costs in the areas of advertising, tour and other promotional support.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P33_S3	The Company believes that to be competitive, the Company also needs to continue to incur significant expenses in tour, advertising and promotional support.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Unless there is a change in competitive conditions, these competitive pressures and increased costs will continue to adversely affect the profitability of the Company s golf ball business.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The Company s accessories include golf bags, golf gloves, golf footwear, golf apparel and other items.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The Company faces significant competition in every region with respect to each of these product categories.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In most cases, the Company is not the market leader with respect to its accessory markets.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	The Company s golf club and golf ball business has a concentrated customer base.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P34_S4	The loss of one or more of the Company s top customers could have a significant effect on the Company s golf club and golf ball sales.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P34_S5	On a consolidated basis, no one customer that distributes golf clubs or golf balls in the United States accounted for more than 8% , 9% and 8% of the Company s consolidated revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P34_S6	The Company's top five customers accounted for approximately 22% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2016, 26% in 2015 and 25% in 2014.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P34_S7	On a segment basis, the Company's top five golf club customers accounted for approximately 23% of total consolidated golf club sales in 2016, and approximately 25% of total consolidated golf club sales in each of 2015 and 2014.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P34_S8	The top five golf ball customers accounted for approximately 28% of total consolidated golf ball sales in 2016 and 30% in each of 2015 and 2014.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P34_S9	A loss of one or more of these customers would have a significant adverse effect on the Company s golf club and golf ball sales.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P34_S10	International political instability and terrorist activities may decrease demand for the Company s products and disrupt its business.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P34_S11	Terrorist activities and armed conflicts could have an adverse effect on the United States or worldwide economy and could cause decreased demand for the Company s products as consumers attention and interests are diverted from golf and become focused on issues relating to these events.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P34_S12	If such events disrupt domestic or international air, ground or sea shipments, or the operation of the Company s manufacturing facilities, the Company s ability to obtain the materials necessary to manufacture its products and to deliver customer orders would be harmed, which would have a significant adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P34_S13	Such events can negatively impact tourism, which could adversely affect the Company s sales to retailers at resorts and other vacation destinations.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P34_S14	In addition, the occurrence of political instability and/or terrorist activities generally restricts travel to and from the affected areas, making it more difficult in general to manage the company s international operations.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P34_S15	The Company s business could be harmed by the occurrence of natural disasters or pandemic diseases.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P34_S16	The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, tsunami, fire, flood or hurricane, or the outbreak of a pandemic disease, could significantly adversely affect the Company s business.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	adversely affect both the demand for the Company s products as well as the supply of the components used to make the Company s products.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Demand for golf products also could be negatively affected as consumers in the affected regions restrict their recreational activities and as tourism to those areas declines.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If the Company s suppliers experienced a significant disruption in their business as a result of a natural disaster or pandemic disease, the Company s ability to obtain the necessary components to make its products could be significantly adversely affected.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P35_S3	In addition, the occurrence of a natural disaster or the outbreak of a pandemic disease generally restricts travel to and from the affected areas, making it more difficult in general to manage the Company s international operations.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P35_S4	The Company s business and operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could result in fluctuations in its operating results and stock price.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The Company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	The Company s first-quarter sales generally represent the Company s sell-in to the golf retail channel of its golf club products for the new golf season.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	The Company s second and third-quarter sales generally represent reorder business for golf clubs.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Sales of golf clubs during the second and third quarters are significantly affected not only by the sell-through of the Company s products that were sold into the channel during the first quarter but also by the sell-through of products by the Company s competitors.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Retailers are sometimes reluctant to reorder the Company s products in significant quantities when they already have excess inventory of products of the Company or its competitors.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The Company s sales of golf balls are generally associated with the level of rounds played in the areas where the Company s products are sold.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Therefore, golf ball sales tend to be greater in the second and third quarters, when the weather is good in most of the Company s key regions and the number of rounds played are up.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Golf ball sales are also stimulated by product introductions as the retail channel takes on initial supplies.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Like those of golf clubs, reorders of golf balls depend on the rate of sell-through.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The Company s sales during the fourth quarter are generally significantly less than those of the other quarters because in many of the Company s key regions fewer people are playing golf during that time of year due to cold weather.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Furthermore, the Company generally announces its new product line in the fourth quarter to allow retailers to plan for the new golf season.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Such early announcements of new products could cause golfers, and therefore the Company s customers, to defer purchasing additional golf equipment until the Company s new products are available.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Such deferments could have a material adverse effect on sales of the Company s current products or result in closeout sales at reduced prices.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P38_S5	The seasonality of the Company s business could be exacerbated by the adverse effects of unusual or severe weather conditions as well as by severe weather conditions caused by climate change on the Company s business.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Due to the seasonality of the Company s business, the Company s business can be significantly adversely affected by unusual or severe weather conditions and by severe weather conditions caused by climate change.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Unfavorable weather conditions generally result in fewer golf rounds played, which generally results in reduced demand for all golf products, and in particular, golf balls.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Furthermore, catastrophic storms can negatively affect golf rounds played both during the storms and afterward, as storm damaged golf courses are repaired and golfers focus on repairing the damage to their homes, businesses and communities.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Consequently, sustained adverse weather conditions, especially during the warm weather months, could materially affect the Company s sales.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The Company may be subject to product warranty claims that require the replacement or repair of products sold.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Such warranty claims could adversely affect the Company s results of operations and relationships with its customers.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The Company manufactures and/or distributes a variety of golf-related products and has a stated two-year warranty policy for its golf clubs.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	From time to time, such products may contain manufacturing defects or design flaws that are not detected prior to sale, particularly in the case of new product introductions or upon design changes to existing products.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	The failure to identify and correct manufacturing defects and product design issues prior to the sale of those products could result in product warranty claims that result in costs to replace or repair any such defective products.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Because many of the Company s products are sold to retailers for broad consumer distribution and/or to customers who buy in large quantities, there could be significant costs associated with such product warranty claims, including the potential for customer dissatisfaction that may adversely affect the Company s reputation and relationships with its customers, which may result in lost or reduced sales.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of the Company s total assets and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact the Company's results of operations and shareholders equity.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P41_S5	The Company s goodwill and intangible assets consist of goodwill from acquisitions, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, patents and other intangible assets.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Such indicators include a sustained decline in the Company s stock price or market capitalization, adverse changes in economic or market conditions or prospects, and changes in the Company s operations.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	An asset is considered to be impaired when its carrying value exceeds its fair value.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The Company determines the fair value of an asset based upon the discounted cash flows expected to be realized from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	If in conducting an impairment evaluation the Company determines that the carrying value of an asset exceeded its fair value, the Company would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	If a significant amount of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets were deemed to be impaired, the Company s results of operations and shareholders equity would be significantly adversely affected.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P44_S3	The Company s ability to utilize all or a portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets may be limited significantly if the Company experiences an ownership change.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P44_S4	The Company has a significant amount of U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards, other losses and credit carryforwards.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P44_S5	The Company s ability to utilize the losses and credits to offset future taxable income may be limited significantly if the Company were to experience an ownership change as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
837465_17_ITEM1A_P44_S6	In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in ownership of the Company s stock by 5-percent shareholders (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P44_S7	The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred for purposes of Section 382 is complex and requires significant judgment.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P44_S8	The extent to which the Company s ability to utilize the losses and credits is limited as a result of such an ownership change depends on many variables, including the value of the Company s stock at the time of the ownership change.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P44_S9	The Company continues to monitor changes in ownership.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P44_S10	If such a cumulative increase did occur in any three-year period and the Company were limited in the amount of losses and credits it could use to offset taxable income, the Company s results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P44_S11	Changes in equipment standards under applicable Rules of Golf could adversely affect the Company s business.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P44_S12	The Company seeks to have its new golf club and golf ball products satisfy the standards published by the USGA and The R A in the Rules of Golf because these standards are generally followed by golfers, both professional and amateur, within their respective jurisdictions.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P44_S13	The USGA publishes rules that are generally followed in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and The R A publishes rules that are generally followed in most other countries throughout the world.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P44_S14	However, the Rules of Golf as published by The R A and the USGA are virtually the same and are intended to be so pursuant to a Joint Statement of Principles issued in 2001.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	In the future, existing USGA and/or R A standards may be altered in ways that adversely affect the sales of the Company s current or future products.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	If a change in rules were adopted and caused one or more of the Company s current or future products to be nonconforming, the Company s sales of such products would be adversely affected.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	The Company s sales and business could be materially and adversely affected if professional golfers do not endorse or use the Company s products.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The Company establishes relationships with professional golfers in order to evaluate and promote Callaway Golf, Odyssey and OGIO branded products.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The Company has entered into endorsement arrangements with members of the various professional tours, including the Champions Tour, the PGA Tour, the LPGA Tour, the PGA European Tour, the Japan Golf Tour and the Web.com Tour.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	While most professional golfers fulfill their contractual obligations, some have been known to stop using a sponsor s products despite contractual commitments.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	If certain of the Company s professional endorsers were to stop using the Company s products contrary to their endorsement agreements, the Company s business could be adversely affected in a material way by the negative publicity or lack of endorsement.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The Company believes that professional usage of its golf clubs and golf balls contributes to retail sales.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	The Company therefore spends a significant amount of money to secure professional usage of its products.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Many other companies, however, also aggressively seek the patronage of these professionals and offer many inducements, including significant cash incentives and specially designed products.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	There is a great deal of competition to secure the representation of tour professionals.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	As a result, it is expensive to attract and retain such tour professionals.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P49_S2	The inducements offered by other companies could result in a decrease in usage of the Company s products by professional golfers or limit the Company s ability to attract other tour professionals.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P49_S3	A decline in the level of professional usage of the Company s products, or a significant increase in the cost to attract or retain endorsers, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s sales and business.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The Company s current senior management team and other key executives are critical to the Company s success, and the loss of, and failure to adequately replace, any such individual could significantly harm the Company s business.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The Company s ability to maintain its competitive position is dependent to a large degree on the efforts and skills of the senior officers of the Company.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P51_S1	The Company s executives are experienced and highly qualified with strong reputations in the golf industry, and the Company believes that its management team enables it to pursue the Company s strategic goals.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P51_S2	The success of the Company s business is dependent upon the management and leadership skills of its senior management team and other key personnel.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Competition for these individuals talents is intense, and the Company may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P51_S4	The loss of one or more of these senior officers could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its ability to achieve its strategic goals.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Failure to adequately enforce the Company s intellectual property rights could adversely affect its reputation and sales.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The golf club industry, in general, has been characterized by widespread imitation of popular club designs.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The Company has an active program of monitoring, investigating and enforcing its proprietary rights against companies and individuals who market or manufacture counterfeits and knockoff products.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	The Company asserts its rights against infringers of its copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade dress.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P53_S2	However, these efforts may not be successful in reducing sales of golf products by these infringers.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Additionally, other golf club manufacturers may be able to produce successful golf clubs which imitate the Company s designs without infringing any of the Company s copyrights, patents, trademarks or trade dress.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P53_S4	The failure to prevent or limit such infringers or imitators could adversely affect the Company s reputation and sales.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P53_S5	The Company may become subject to intellectual property lawsuits that could cause it to incur significant costs or pay significant damages or that could prohibit it from selling its products.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P53_S6	The Company s competitors also seek to obtain patent, trademark, copyright or other protection of their proprietary rights and designs for golf clubs, golf balls and other golf products.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P53_S7	From time to time, third parties have claimed or may claim in the future that the Company s products infringe upon their proprietary rights.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P53_S8	The Company evaluates any such claims and, where appropriate, has obtained or sought to obtain licenses or other business arrangements.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P53_S9	To date, there have been no significant interruptions in the Company s business as a result of any claims of infringement.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P53_S10	However, in the future, intellectual property claims could force the Company to alter its existing products or withdraw them from the market or could delay the introduction of new products.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Various patents have been issued to the Company s competitors in the golf industry and these competitors may assert that the Company s golf products infringe their patent or other proprietary rights.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	If the Company s golf products are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights, the Company may be unable to obtain a license to use such technology, and it could incur substantial costs to redesign its products, withdraw them from the market, and/or to defend legal actions.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The Company s brands may be damaged by the actions of its licensees.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The Company licenses its trademarks to third-party licensees who produce, market and sell their products bearing the Company s trademarks.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	The Company chooses its licensees carefully and imposes upon such licensees various restrictions on the products, and on the manner, on which such trademarks may be used.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P56_S2	In addition, the Company requires its licensees to abide by certain standards of conduct and the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P56_S3	However, if a licensee fails to adhere to these requirements, the Company s brands could be damaged.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P56_S4	The Company s brands could also be damaged if a licensee becomes insolvent or by any negative publicity concerning a licensee or if the licensee does not maintain good relationships with its customers or consumers, many of which are also the Company s customers and consumers.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P56_S5	Sales of the Company s products by unauthorized retailers or distributors could adversely affect the Company s authorized distribution channels and harm the Company s reputation.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P56_S6	Some of the Company s products find their way to unauthorized outlets or distribution channels.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P56_S7	This gray market for the Company s products can undermine authorized retailers and foreign wholesale distributors who promote and support the Company s products, and can injure the Company s image in the minds of its customers and consumers.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P56_S8	On the other hand, stopping such commerce could result in a potential decrease in sales to those customers who are selling the Company s products to unauthorized distributors or an increase in sales returns over historical levels.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P56_S9	While the Company has taken some lawful steps to limit commerce of its products in the gray market in both the United States and abroad, it has not stopped such commerce.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the Company's effective income tax rate and profitability.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	The Company's effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-US earnings for which the Company has not previously provided for U.S. taxes.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P58_S2	The Company regularly assesses all of these matters to determine the adequacy of its tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The Company relies on complex information systems for management of its manufacturing, distribution, sales and other functions.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P59_S1	If the Company s information systems fail to perform these functions adequately or if the Company experiences an interruption in their operation, including a breach in cyber security, its business and results of operations could suffer.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	All of the Company s major operations, including manufacturing, distribution, sales and accounting, are dependent upon the Company s complex information systems.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	The Company s information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:
837465_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Hackers, computer viruses, software bugs or glitches.
837465_17_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Any damage or significant disruption in the operation of such systems or the failure of the Company s information systems to perform as expected would disrupt the Company s business, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess inventory and product shortages and otherwise adversely affect the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company leases its golf ball manufacturing plant in Chicopee, Massachusetts comprised of approximately 293,000 square feet, which the Company believes is adequate for its ongoing golf ball manufacturing operations at such facility.
837465_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	The lease term for this facility expires in February 2028.
837465_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company leases a golf club manufacturing facility in Monterrey, Mexico comprised of approximately 180,000 square feet.

837465_17_ITEM2_P1_S5	The lease term for this facility expires in December 2025.
837465_17_ITEM2_P1_S6	The Company owns and leases additional properties domestically and internationally, including properties in the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom, China, and India.
837465_17_ITEM2_P1_S7	The Company s operations at each of these properties includes to some extent activities related to both the golf club and golf ball businesses.
837465_17_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Company believes that its facilities currently are adequate to meet its requirements.
837465_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to liquidity, capital availability and quarterly determinations that cash dividends are in the best interests of its shareholders.
837465_17_ITEM5_P0_S1	Future dividends may be affected by, among other items, the Company s views on potential future capital requirements, projected cash flows and needs, changes to the Company s business model, and certain restrictions limiting dividends imposed by the ABL Facility (see Note 3 Financing Arrangements , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	Performance Graph The following graph presents a comparison of the cumulative total shareholder return of the Company s common stock since December 31, 2011 to two indices: the Standard Poor s 500 Index ( S P 500 ) and the Standard Poor s 600 Smallcap Index ( S P 600 ).
837465_17_ITEM5_P1_S1	The S P 500 tracks the aggregate price performance of equity securities of 500 large-cap companies that are actively traded in the United States, and is considered to be a leading indicator of U.S. equity securities.
837465_17_ITEM5_P1_S2	The S P 600 is a market value-weighted index that tracks the aggregate price performance of equity securities from a broad range of small-cap stocks traded in the United States.
837465_17_ITEM5_P1_S3	The graph assumes an initial investment of $100 at December 31, 2011 and reinvestment of all dividends in ELY stock on the dividend payable date.
837465_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	The Callaway Golf Company cumulative total shareholder return is based upon the closing prices of Callaway Golf Company common stock on December 31, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 of $5.53, $6.50, $8.43, $7.70, $9.42 and $10.96, respectively.
837465_17_ITEM5_P2_S1	In August 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a $50.0 million share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase shares of its common stock in the open market or in private transactions, subject to the Company s assessment of market conditions and buying opportunities.
837465_17_ITEM5_P2_S2	The repurchases are made consistent with the terms of the Company's primary credit facility which limits the amount of stock that can be repurchased.
837465_17_ITEM5_P2_S3	The repurchase program will remain in effect until completed or until terminated by the Board of Directors.
837465_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	The table below summarizes the Company's share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2016.
837465_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	During 2016, the Company repurchased approximately 572,000 shares of its common stock under the 2014 repurchase program at an average cost per share of $8.99 for a total cost of $5.1 million .
837465_17_ITEM5_P4_S1	Included in these repurchases are shares the Company acquired to satisfy the Company's tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting and settlement of employee restricted stock unit awards.
837465_17_ITEM5_P4_S2	The Company s repurchases of shares of common stock are recorded at cost and result in a reduction of shareholders equity.
837465_17_ITEM5_P4_S3	As of December 31, 2016, the total amount remaining under the repurchase authorization was $41.9 million.
837465_17_ITEM6_P0_S0	(1) The Company's tax provision, total assets and long-term liabilities were significantly impacted in 2016 by the reversal of the Company's valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_17_ITEM6_P0_S1	In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company performed an analysis to determine the realization of its deferred tax assets and concluded that it was more likely than not that the majority of its U.S. deferred tax assets will be realized, which resulted in a one-time, non-cash benefit of $156.6 million related to the reversal of the Company's valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_17_ITEM6_P0_S2	This reversal was partially offset by the recognition of $16.0 million in income taxes that were retroactive for all of 2016 on the Company's U.S. business.
837465_17_ITEM6_P0_S3	In July 2016, the Company contributed $10.6 million , primarily in cash, for a 52% ownership of the new joint venture, Callaway Apparel K.K. (see Note 7 " Joint Venture " in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_17_ITEM6_P0_S4	The Company is required to consolidate the financial results of the joint venture and, as a result, the Company recorded net income attributable to the non-controlling interest of $1.1 million in its consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2016 .
837465_17_ITEM6_P0_S5	At December 31, 2016 , the Company recognized a non-controlling interest of $9.7 million in its consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of shareholders' equity.
837465_17_ITEM6_P0_S6	In April 2016, the Company sold approximately 10.0% or $5.8 million (on a cost basis) of its preferred shares in Topgolf for $23.4 million , and recognized a gain of approximately $17.7 million in other income (expense) during the second quarter of 2016.
837465_17_ITEM6_P1_S0	See Note 6 " Investments " in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. (4) In August 2012, the Company issued $112.5 million of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes (the convertible notes ) in exchange for cash and 0.6 million shares of the Company s then-outstanding 7.50% Series B Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock in separate, privately negotiated exchange transactions.
837465_17_ITEM6_P1_S1	During the second half of 2015, the convertible notes were eliminated pursuant to certain exchange transactions and shareholder conversions, which resulted, among other things, in the issuance of approximately 15.0 million shares of common stock to the note holders (see Note 3 Financing Arrangements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_17_ITEM6_P1_S2	In connection with the elimination of the convertible notes and the issuance of the 15.0 million shares of common stock, the Company recorded $109.0 million in shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2015, net of the outstanding discount of $3.4 million.
837465_17_ITEM6_P1_S3	The Company recognized interest expense of $3.2 million , $5.0 million and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
837465_17_ITEM6_P1_S4	This update eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet, and instead classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent.
837465_17_ITEM6_P1_S5	The adoption of this update was made on a prospective basis as of December 31, 2015, therefore working capital and long-term liabilities in 2015 as well as 2016 are not comparable to prior periods presented.
837465_17_ITEM6_P1_S6	(6) The Company s operating statements for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 include pre-tax charges of $16.6 million and $54.1 million, respectively, in connection with the Company's cost-reduction initiatives that were announced in July 2012.
837465_17_ITEM6_P1_S7	As a result of these initiatives, in 2012, the Company recorded related decreases in working capital and total assets from the impairment of certain intangible assets including goodwill, as well as the write-off of certain long-lived assets and inventory.
837465_17_ITEM6_P2_S0	During the first quarter of 2012, in an effort to simplify the Company s operations and increase focus on the Company s core Callaway and Odyssey business, the Company sold its Top-Flite and Ben Hogan brands, including trademarks, service marks and certain other intellectual property for net cash proceeds of $26.9 million.
837465_17_ITEM6_P2_S1	The sale of these two brands resulted in a pre-tax net gain of $6.6 million.
837465_17_ITEM6_P2_S2	(8) The Company s operating statements for the year ended December 31, 2012 includes pre-tax charges of $1.0 million in connection with workforce reductions related to the reorganization and reinvestment initiatives announced in June 2011.
837465_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations, financial condition and liquidity are based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP).
837465_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, shareholders equity, sales and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
837465_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
837465_17_ITEM7_P0_S3	Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
837465_17_ITEM7_P0_S4	On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business and new information as it becomes available.
837465_17_ITEM7_P0_S5	Management believes the critical accounting policies discussed below affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
837465_17_ITEM7_P0_S6	For a complete discussion of all of the Company s significant accounting policies, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized, in general, as products are shipped to customers, net of an allowance for sales returns and accruals for sales programs in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.
837465_17_ITEM7_P0_S7	In certain cases, the Company recognizes sales when products are received by customers.
837465_17_ITEM7_P0_S8	The Company records a reserve for anticipated returns through a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the period that the related sales are recorded.
837465_17_ITEM7_P0_S9	Sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through of products.
837465_17_ITEM7_P0_S10	In addition, from time to time, the Company offers sales programs that allow for specific returns.
837465_17_ITEM7_P0_S11	The Company records a reserve for anticipated returns related to these sales programs based on the terms of the sales program.
837465_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Historically, the Company s actual sales returns have not been materially different from management s original estimates.
837465_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance for sales returns.
837465_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	However, if the actual costs of sales returns are significantly different than the recorded estimated allowance, the Company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
837465_17_ITEM7_P1_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the recorded estimated allowance for 2016 sales returns, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2016 would have decreased by approximately $0.9 million .
837465_17_ITEM7_P1_S4	The Company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings.
837465_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program, management s forecast of future product demand, and historical customer participation in similar programs.
837465_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Company s primary sales program, the Preferred Retailer Program, offers longer payment terms during the initial sell-in period, as well as potential rebates and discounts, for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the Company, including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels, prime product placement and retailer staff training.
837465_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	Under this program, qualifying retailers can earn either discounts or rebates based upon the amount of product purchased.
837465_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	Discounts are applied and recorded at the time of sale.
837465_17_ITEM7_P3_S3	For rebates, the Company accrues an estimate of the rebate at the time of sale based on the customer s estimated qualifying current year product purchases.
837465_17_ITEM7_P3_S4	The estimate is based on the historical level of purchases, adjusted for any factors expected to affect the current year purchase levels.
837465_17_ITEM7_P3_S5	The estimated year-end rebate is adjusted quarterly based on actual purchase levels, as necessary.
837465_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Preferred Retailer Program is generally short term in nature and the actual costs of the program are known as of the end of the year and paid to customers shortly after year-end.
837465_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	In addition to the Preferred Retailer Program, the Company from time to time offers additional sales program incentive offerings which are also generally short term in nature.
837465_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Historically the Company s actual costs related to its Preferred Retailer Program and other sales programs have not been materially different than its estimates.
837465_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	Revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed.
837465_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	In addition, the Company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws.
837465_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	The Company s gift cards have no expiration date.
837465_17_ITEM7_P6_S3	To determine when redemption is remote, the Company analyzes an aging of unredeemed cards (based on the date the card was last used or the activation date if the card has never been used) and compares that information with historical redemption trends.
837465_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to determine the timing of recognition of gift card revenues.
837465_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	The deferred revenue associated with outstanding gift cards was $1.3 million and $1.1 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
837465_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments.
837465_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	An estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, the customer s financial condition and current economic trends, all of which are subject to change.
837465_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	If the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance, the Company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected.
837465_17_ITEM7_P9_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase in uncollectible accounts over the 2016 recorded estimated allowance for doubtful accounts, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2016 would have decreased by approximately $0.6 million .
837465_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value.
837465_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
837465_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	The inventory balance, which includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs, is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory.
837465_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	The estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon current inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience as well as management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand, all of which are subject to change.
837465_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	The calculation of the Company s allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand and pricing, regulatory (USGA and R A) rule changes, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence.
837465_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance.
837465_17_ITEM7_P12_S4	However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner, the Company may need to increase its inventory allowance, which could significantly adversely affect the Company s operating results.
837465_17_ITEM7_P12_S5	Assuming there had been a 10% increase in obsolete or unmarketable inventory over the 2016 recorded estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2016 would have decreased by approximately $1.7 million .
837465_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company acquires tangible and intangible assets.
837465_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and amortizing intangible assets, and investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable or exceeds its fair value.
837465_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	The Company evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually or more frequently whenever indicators are present that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.
837465_17_ITEM7_P13_S3	Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining the amount of undiscounted cash flows directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, the timing of the impairment test, and the asset s residual value, if any.
837465_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	To determine fair value, the Company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate.
837465_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the asset and a charge to earnings.
837465_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	The Company uses its best judgment based on current facts and circumstances related to its business when making these estimates.
837465_17_ITEM7_P14_S3	However, if actual results are not consistent with the Company s estimates and assumptions used in calculating future cash flows and asset fair values, the Company may be exposed to losses that could be material.
837465_17_ITEM7_P14_S4	The Company completed its annual impairment test and fair value analysis of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2016 , and the estimated fair values of the Company s reporting units in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Korea, as well as the estimated fair values of certain trade names and trademarks, significantly exceeded their carrying values.
837465_17_ITEM7_P14_S5	As a result, no impairment was recorded as of December 31, 2016 .
837465_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Warranty Policy The Company has a stated two-year warranty policy for its golf clubs.
837465_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	The Company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded.
837465_17_ITEM7_P15_S2	In estimating its future warranty obligations, the Company considers various relevant factors, including the Company s stated warranty policies and practices, the historical frequency of claims, and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty.
837465_17_ITEM7_P15_S3	The Company s estimates for calculating the warranty reserve are principally based on assumptions regarding the warranty costs of each club product line over the expected warranty period.
837465_17_ITEM7_P15_S4	Where little or no claims experience may exist, the Company s warranty obligation calculation is based upon long-term historical warranty rates of similar products until sufficient data is available.
837465_17_ITEM7_P15_S5	As actual model-specific rates become available, the Company s estimates are modified to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes.
837465_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	Historically, the Company s actual warranty claims have not been materially different from management s original estimated warranty obligation.
837465_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the warranty obligation.
837465_17_ITEM7_P16_S2	However, if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims were to significantly exceed the estimated warranty reserve, the Company may be exposed to losses that could be material.
837465_17_ITEM7_P16_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase in warranty claims over the 2016 recorded estimated allowance for warranty obligations, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2016 would have decreased by approximately $0.5 million .
837465_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Income Taxes Current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year.
837465_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to ASC Topic 740, "Income Taxes," and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
837465_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	The Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
837465_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire.
837465_17_ITEM7_P18_S3	These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment.
837465_17_ITEM7_P18_S4	These estimates are based on the Company s best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions.
837465_17_ITEM7_P18_S5	In 2011, as a result of this evaluation, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_17_ITEM7_P18_S6	During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company reversed a significant portion of the valuation allowance on those deferred tax assets.
837465_17_ITEM7_P18_S7	For further discussion see Note 9 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Pursuant to ASC Topic 740-25-6, the Company is required to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is deemed to be more likely than not that the Company would be required to pay such additional taxes.
837465_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	The Company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions.
837465_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	The preparation of these income tax returns requires the Company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by the Company.
837465_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	The Company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability, including interest and penalties in income tax expense, for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return.
837465_17_ITEM7_P19_S3	The Company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available.
837465_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Historically, additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the Company s uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the Company s expectations.
837465_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
837465_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Share-based Compensation The Company grants stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance share units and other equity-based awards to the Company s officers, employees, consultants and certain other non-employees who provide services to the Company.
837465_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	The Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and non-employees based on estimated fair values.
837465_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	ASC Topic 718 further requires a reduction in share-based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	If actual forfeitures are not consistent with the Company s estimates, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods.
837465_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Performance share units are stock-based awards in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on the Company's performance against specified goals that are measured over a designated performance period from the date of grant.
837465_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	These performance goals are established by the Company at the beginning of the performance period.
837465_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	At the end of the performance period, the number of shares of stock that could be issued is fixed based upon the degree of achievement of the performance goals.
837465_17_ITEM7_P23_S3	The number of shares that could be issued can range from 0% to 200% of the participant's target award.
837465_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Performance share units are initially valued at the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant.
837465_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	Compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the vesting period and will vary based on the anticipated performance level during the performance period.
837465_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	If the performance goals are not probable of achievement during the performance period, compensation expense would be reversed.
837465_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	The awards are canceled if the performance goals are not achieved as of the end of the performance period.
837465_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	The performance units vest in full at the end of a three-year period.
837465_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options and stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) at the date of grant.
837465_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the Company s expected stock price volatility, the expected dividend yield, the expected term of an option or SAR and the risk-free interest rate, which is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
837465_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected price volatility and the expected term.
837465_17_ITEM7_P26_S3	The Company uses forecasted dividends to estimate the expected dividend yield.
837465_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option or SAR.
837465_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option or SAR does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee.
837465_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for stock options.
837465_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	Compensation expense for SARs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an award s estimated fair value, which is remeasured at the end of each reporting period.
837465_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	Once vested, SARs continued to be remeasured to fair value until they are exercised.
837465_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company records compensation expense for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (collectively restricted stock ) based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
837465_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	The estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares underlying the award.
837465_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, reduced by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Phantom stock units are a form of share-based awards that are indexed to the Company s stock and are settled in cash.
837465_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	Compensation expense for phantom stock units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the award s estimated fair value.
837465_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	Fair value is remeasured at the end of each interim reporting period through the award s settlement date and is based on the closing price of the Company s stock.
837465_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	Foreign Currency Translation A significant portion of the Company s business is conducted outside of the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
837465_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	As a result, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on the Company s financial results.
837465_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Revenues and expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the average exchange rate for the period.
837465_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date.
837465_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	Gains and losses from assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity on which they reside are generally recognized currently in the Company's statements of operations.
837465_17_ITEM7_P32_S3	Gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.
837465_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	As part of the Company's overall strategy to manage its level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts.
837465_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	While these foreign currency forward contracts can mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, they do not eliminate those effects, which can be significant.
837465_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	For all contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges, the Company records gains and losses in other comprehensive income or loss.
837465_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	These gains and losses are released from other comprehensive income or loss and recognized in net sales or cost of goods sold in the period in which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized.
837465_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	Gains and losses on derivatives that are not elected for hedge accounting treatment or that do not meet hedge accounting requirements are recorded immediately in other income (expense).
837465_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by this reference.
837465_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Discussion of Non-GAAP Measures In addition to the financial results contained in this report, which have been prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company has also included supplemental information concerning the Company s financial results on a non-GAAP basis.
837465_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	This non-GAAP information includes certain of the Company s financial results on a constant currency basis.
837465_17_ITEM7_P36_S2	This constant currency information estimates what the Company s financial results would have been without changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_17_ITEM7_P36_S3	This information is calculated by taking the current period local currency results and translating them into U.S. Dollars based upon the foreign currency exchange rates for the applicable comparable prior period.
837465_17_ITEM7_P36_S4	It does not include any other effect of changes in foreign currency rates on the Company s results or business.
837465_17_ITEM7_P36_S5	This non-GAAP information also includes certain of the Company's financial results excluding the effects of the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance and the gain on the sale of a portion of the Company's Topgolf investment.
837465_17_ITEM7_P36_S6	The Company has included in this report information to reconcile this non-GAAP information to the most directly correlated GAAP information.
837465_17_ITEM7_P36_S7	The non-GAAP information presented in this report should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with GAAP.
837465_17_ITEM7_P36_S8	The non-GAAP information may also be inconsistent with the manner in which similar measures are derived or used by other companies.
837465_17_ITEM7_P36_S9	Management uses such non-GAAP information for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period over period comparisons of the underlying performance of its business and in forecasting the Company s business going forward.
837465_17_ITEM7_P36_S10	Management believes that the presentation of such non-GAAP information, when considered in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP information, provides additional useful comparative information for investors in their assessment of the underlying performance of the Company s business.
837465_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Results of Operations Overview of Business, Seasonality and Foreign Currency Products.
837465_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	The Company designs, manufactures and sells high quality golf clubs, golf balls, golf bags and other golf-related accessories.
837465_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	The Company designs its products to be technologically advanced and in this regard invests a considerable amount in research and development each year.
837465_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	The Company s golf products are designed for golfers of all skill levels, both amateur and professional.
837465_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	The Company has two reportable operating segments that are organized on the basis of products, namely the golf clubs segment and golf balls segment.
837465_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	The golf clubs segment consists of Callaway Golf woods, hybrids, irons and wedges and Odyssey putters, including Toulon Design putters.
837465_17_ITEM7_P40_S3	This segment also includes packaged sets, golf bags, golf gloves, golf footwear, golf apparel, travel gear, headwear, towels, umbrellas, eyewear and other accessories, as well as royalties from licensing of the Company s trademarks and service marks as well as sales of pre-owned golf clubs.
837465_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	The golf balls segment consists of Callaway Golf and Strata balls that are designed, manufactured and sold by the Company.
837465_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	As discussed in Note 16 Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, the Company s operating segments exclude a significant amount of corporate general administrative expenses and other income (expense) not utilized by management in determining segment profitability.
837465_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	The Company s cost of sales is comprised primarily of material and component costs, distribution and warehousing costs, and overhead.
837465_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	A large percentage of the Company's manufacturing costs are variable in nature and will fluctuate with sales volumes.
837465_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	With respect to the Company's operating segments, variable costs for golf clubs represent approximately 85% to 95% of cost of sales, and for golf balls, approximately 75% to 85%.
837465_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	Of these variable costs, material and component costs represent approximately 85% to 95% for golf clubs and approximately 75% to 85% for golf balls.
837465_17_ITEM7_P43_S4	On a consolidated basis, over 85% of total cost of sales is variable in nature, and of this amount, over 85% is comprised of material and component costs.
837465_17_ITEM7_P43_S5	Generally, the relative significance of the components of cost of sales does not vary materially from these percentages from period to period.
837465_17_ITEM7_P43_S6	See "Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 - Segment Profitability" and "Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 - Segment Profitability" below for further discussion of gross margins.
837465_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	In most of the regions where the Company does business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis.
837465_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	Weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year-round, except in a few markets, with many of the Company s on-course customers closing for the cold weather months.
837465_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	The Company s business is therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_17_ITEM7_P44_S3	In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season.
837465_17_ITEM7_P44_S4	This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter.
837465_17_ITEM7_P44_S5	The Company s second-quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter.
837465_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	dependent on reorder business but are generally less than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season.
837465_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	The Company s fourth-quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company s key markets.
837465_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	However, fourth-quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year.
837465_17_ITEM7_P45_S3	This seasonality, and therefore quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as well as weather conditions.
837465_17_ITEM7_P45_S4	Because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company s sales and most, if not all, of its profitability generally occurs during the first half of the year.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	A significant portion of the Company s business is conducted outside of the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	As a result, changes in foreign currency rates can have a significant effect on the Company s financial results.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S3	While these foreign currency forward contracts can mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates, they do not eliminate those effects, which can be significant.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S4	These effects include (i) the translation of results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, (ii) the mark-to-market adjustments of certain intercompany balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies and (iii) the mark-to-market adjustments on the Company s foreign currency forward contracts.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S5	In general, the Company s overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts its business.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S6	Executive Summary Management was pleased with the Company s financial results and progress in 2016.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S7	Despite softer than expected market conditions in 2016, particularly in Asia, the Company not only continued to demonstrate its ability to grow market share and increase net sales, profitability and cash from operations but also began executing its strategy of investing in growth opportunities in golf and in areas tangential to golf.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S8	In 2016, the Company acquired Toulon Design putters and entered into a new apparel joint venture in Japan.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S9	These investment activities continued into 2017 when the Company completed its acquisition of OGIO International Inc. ( OGIO ), a leading manufacturer in high quality bags, accessories and apparel in the golf and lifestyle categories.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S10	This acquisition both enhanced the Company s presence in golf and provided a platform for future growth in the lifestyle category.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S11	The Company s improved profitability and outlook also allowed the Company to reverse a significant portion of its deferred tax valuation allowance.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S12	During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company performed an analysis to determine the likelihood of realizing its deferred tax assets.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S13	This analysis consisted of the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence, including the Company's improved profitability in 2015 and 2016 (which resulted in the Company having three years of cumulative income on its U.S. business as of December 31, 2016), combined with future projections of profitability.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S14	Because of this analysis, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the majority of its U.S. deferred tax assets will be realized, and therefore reversed most of the valuation allowance.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S15	This reversal resulted in a one-time, non-cash income tax benefit of $156.6 million partially offset by the recognition of $16.0 million in income taxes that were retroactive for all of 2016 on the Company s U.S. business earnings for a net benefit of $140.6 million.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S16	For further discussion, see Note 9 "Income Taxes" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. In 2016, the Company s net sales increased $27.4 million (3.2%) to $871.2 million compared to $843.8 million in 2015.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S17	This increase was led by an increase in golf apparel sales due to the formation and consolidation of the Company s new apparel joint venture in Japan beginning in the third quarter of 2016, combined with an increase in sales in the golf balls and irons categories.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S18	In addition, net sales in 2016 were favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S19	On a constant currency basis, net sales in 2016 would have increased 2.3% compared to 2015.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S20	The Company s gross margin for 2016 improved by 180 basis points to 44.2% compared to 2015.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S21	This increase was primarily due to operational efficiencies resulting from the many initiatives implemented over the last few years related to its manufacturing and supply chain functions, combined with higher average selling prices in all major hard goods categories.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S22	This increase was partially offset by an increase in promotional activity compared to the same period in 2015.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S23	Operating expenses increased $10.2 million or 3.1% and were flat as a percentage of net sales in 2016 compared to 2015.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S24	The increase in 2016 was primarily related to incremental expenses related to the Japan joint venture combined with increases in legal expenses related to corporate development activities, partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense.
837465_17_ITEM7_P46_S25	Interest expense decreased $6.3 million to $2.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the retirement of the Company's convertible senior notes during the second half of 2015.
837465_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	In 2016, the Company completed the sale of a small portion of its preferred shares of Topgolf International, Inc. doing business as the Topgolf Entertainment Group ("Topgolf") for total proceeds of $23.4 million, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $17.7 million.
837465_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	Immediately after the sale, the Company retained a 15% ownership interest in Topgolf.
837465_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	Other income/expense in 2016 decreased by $3.2 million to other expense of $1.7 million compared to other income of $1.5 million in 2015 primarily due to an increase in net losses from the Company's foreign currency hedging contracts.
837465_17_ITEM7_P47_S3	The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $132.6 million in 2016 compared to an income tax provision of $5.5 million in 2015.
837465_17_ITEM7_P47_S4	As previously mentioned, the income tax benefit in 2016 includes the $140.6 million net impact of the reversal of a significant portion of the Company s valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_17_ITEM7_P47_S5	Net income increased $175.3 million to $189.9 million in 2016, and diluted earnings per share increased by $1.81 to $1.98.
837465_17_ITEM7_P47_S6	As discussed above, net income for 2016 includes (i) the $140.6 million ($1.47 per share) net impact of the reversal of a significant portion of the Company s valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets and (ii) a $17.7 million ($0.18 per share) gain from the sale of preferred shares of Topgolf.
837465_17_ITEM7_P47_S7	Excluding the impact of these items, the Company s net income would have been $31.6 million, a 116.4% increase compared to 2015, and diluted earnings per share would have been $0.33, a 94.1% increase over 2015.
837465_17_ITEM7_P47_S8	The Company also significantly improved its cash position in 2016 compared to 2015.
837465_17_ITEM7_P47_S9	Cash flows from operating activities during 2016 increased $47.1 million to $77.7 million compared to 2015.
837465_17_ITEM7_P47_S10	This increase was primarily due to the increase in sales as discussed above, combined with an improvement in the Company s cash conversion cycle and improved inventory management.
837465_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $ 27.4 million (3.2%) to $871.2 million compared to $843.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
837465_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	Despite softer than anticipated market conditions in 2016, the Company improved its market share due to the continued strength of its brand, resulting in increased sales in both the Company's golf clubs and golf balls operating segments.
837465_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	Overall, net sales were favorably impacted by an increase in average selling prices across all product categories, partially offset by a decline in sales volumes.
837465_17_ITEM7_P48_S3	In addition, the Company's net sales of accessories and other products were favorably impacted by the completion of its joint venture in Japan during the second quarter of 2016, resulting in the formation of Callaway Apparel KK, which has been consolidated with the Company's results since July 1, 2016.
837465_17_ITEM7_P48_S4	Changes in foreign currency rates were favorable to the Company's net sales in 2016.
837465_17_ITEM7_P48_S5	Had the Company used 2015 foreign currency exchange rates to translate net sales for 2016, the Company's net sales for 2016 would have been lower by 0.9%.
837465_17_ITEM7_P48_S6	The Company s net sales by operating segment are presented below (dollars in millions):
837465_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	For further discussion of each operating segment s results, see Golf Clubs Segment and Golf Balls Segment results below.
837465_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	Net sales information by region is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	Net sales in the United States increased $1.1 million ( 0.2% ) to $447.6 million during 2016 compared to $446.5 million in 2015 , primarily as a result of improved market share due to the continued strength of the brand.
837465_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	The Company s sales in regions outside of the United States increased $26.3 million ( 6.6% ) to $423.6 million in 2016 compared to $397.3 million in 2015 , primarily due to the formation of the Company's apparel joint venture in Japan beginning in the third quarter of 2016.
837465_17_ITEM7_P51_S2	In addition, foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $8.4 million on the Company's net sales denominated in foreign currencies.
837465_17_ITEM7_P51_S3	This increase was partially offset by softer than anticipated market conditions in Asia.
837465_17_ITEM7_P51_S4	Gross profit increased $ 27.4 million to $ 385.0 million in 2016 from $ 357.6 million in 2015 .
837465_17_ITEM7_P51_S5	Gross profit as a percent of net sales ("gross margin") increased 180 basis points to 44.2% in 2016 from 42.4% in 2015 .
837465_17_ITEM7_P51_S6	This increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase of 143 basis points resulting from improved operational efficiencies, combined with an increase of 84 basis points in price and product mix as a result of an increase in average selling prices within the golf balls, irons and woods categories, partially offset by an increase in promotional activity on some of the Company's irons products period over period and the unfavorable impact (47 basis points) of changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from inventory held in foreign regions.
837465_17_ITEM7_P51_S7	For a further discussion of gross margin, see "Segment Profitability" below.
837465_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	Selling expenses increased by $6.6 million to $235.6 million ( 27.0% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $228.9 million ( 27.1% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2015 , primarily due to the formation of the Company's apparel joint venture in Japan which resulted in $6.4 million of additional selling expenses.
837465_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	General and administrative expenses increased by $3.4 million to $72.0 million ( 8.3% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $68.6 million ( 8.1% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2015 .
837465_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	This increase was primarily due to an increase of $3.2 million in legal expenses and professional fees resulting primarily from corporate development projects, and $0.9 million of additional general and administrative expenses resulting from the formation and consolidation of the Company's apparel joint venture in Japan.
837465_17_ITEM7_P52_S3	These increases were partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in stock compensation expense as a result of the payout of cash-settled stock awards period over period.
837465_17_ITEM7_P52_S4	Research and development expenses increased by $0.1 million to $33.3 million ( 3.8% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $33.2 million ( 3.9% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2015 .
837465_17_ITEM7_P52_S5	Interest expense decreased by $6.3 million to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $8.7 million in the comparable period of 2015 primarily due to the savings realized in connection with the retirement of the Company's convertible notes into shares of common stock during the second half of 2015, including the acceleration of debt issuance costs (see Note 3 " Financing Arrangements " to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_17_ITEM7_P52_S6	During 2016, the Company sold approximately 10.0% of its preferred shares in Topgolf International, Inc. doing business as the Topgolf Entertainment Group ("Topgolf") for $23.4 million and recognized a $17.7 million gain in other income.
837465_17_ITEM7_P52_S7	See Note 6 Investments to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Excluding the gain recognized from the sale of preferred shares of Topgolf as discussed above, other income (expense) decreased by $3.2 million to other expense of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to other income of $1.5 million in the comparable period of 2015 primarily due to an increase in net foreign currency losses from non-designated foreign currency hedging contracts.
837465_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $132.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared to an income tax provision of $5.5 million in the comparable period of 2015 .
837465_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	The income tax benefit for 2016 includes a one-time, non-cash benefit of $156.6 million related to the reversal of a signification portion of the Company's valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_17_ITEM7_P53_S2	This reversal was partially offset by the recognition of $16.0 million in income taxes that were retroactive for all of 2016 on the Company's U.S. business earnings.
837465_17_ITEM7_P53_S3	The Company used an effective U.S. income tax rate that is close to statutory rates to assess the income tax provision on its U.S. business.
837465_17_ITEM7_P53_S4	For further discussion, see Note 9 " Income Taxes " to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased to $189.9 million compared to $14.6 million in the comparable period of 2015 .

837465_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	As discussed above, during the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company reversed a significant portion of the valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets and recognized income taxes that were retroactive for all of 2016 on the Company's U.S. business earnings, which resulted in a net favorable impact to net income of $140.6 million ($1.47 per share).
837465_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	In addition, net income for 2016 includes a $17.7 million ($0.18 per share) pre-tax gain, as discussed above, from the sale preferred shares in Topgolf.
837465_17_ITEM7_P54_S2	Excluding the impact of the valuation allowance reversal, the recognition of additional income taxes and the gain recognized on the sale of a portion of the Company's investment in Topgolf, the Company's net income would have been $31.6 million, a 116.4% increase compared to 2015, and diluted earnings per share would have been $0.33, a 94.1% increase compared to 2015.

837465_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	This increase was primarily due to the formation of the Company's apparel joint venture in Japan during the third quarter of 2016, combined with an increase in average selling prices across all product categories, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes in the woods, irons and putters categories.

837465_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	The decline in sales volumes was primarily due to a shift in launch timing resulting in fewer woods products launched during 2016 compared to the prior year.
837465_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	The increase in average selling prices was primarily due to a price increase on the Company's XR 16 drivers and fairway woods launched in 2016, relative to the XR woods launched in the prior year.
837465_17_ITEM7_P56_S3	Net sales of irons increased $6.4 million ( 3.1% ) to $211.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a 4.7% increase in average selling prices, partially offset by a 1.5% decline in sales volumes.
837465_17_ITEM7_P56_S4	The increase in average selling prices was primarily due to a full year of sales of the more premium APEX irons which were launched during the fourth quarter of 2015, combined with an increase in average selling prices of wedges resulting from price reductions taken in the prior year on the Mac Daddy 2 wedges in anticipation of the MD3 launch.
837465_17_ITEM7_P56_S5	This increase was partially offset by an increase in promotional activity in 2016 related to reduced prices on the Company's XR irons which were in the second year of their product lifecycle.
837465_17_ITEM7_P56_S6	The slight decline in sales volumes related to a decline in unit sales of wedges due to the full launch of the MD3 wedges in 2015 compared to the more limited launches of the X Series and MD Forged wedges in 2016.
837465_17_ITEM7_P56_S7	Net sales of putters decreased $0.3 million ( 0.3% ) to $86.0 million for the year December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a 1.7% decline in sales volumes, partially offset by a 1.4% increase in average selling prices.
837465_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	to the full line of Odyssey Works putters launched in the prior year.
837465_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	The increase in average selling prices was primarily due to the limited offerings of the Company's Toe Up and Stroke Lab putters, which had a higher average selling price than the Company's core putters offered in the prior year.
837465_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	Net sales of accessories and other products increased $32.5 million ( 17.4% ) to $219.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.

837465_17_ITEM7_P57_S4	Additionally, the Company experienced an increase in sales of packaged sets and other accessories compared to the same period in 2015.
837465_17_ITEM7_P57_S5	These increases were partially offset by a decline in sales of golf bags, gloves and footwear.

837465_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	The increase in average selling prices was primarily due to an increase in the sales price of the Company's 2016 Chrome Soft golf balls combined with sales of the Company's higher priced Truvis golf balls during the current year.
837465_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	The decline in sales volume was primarily due to a decrease in sales of the Company's lower priced special market golf balls in 2016 compared to 2015.
837465_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	Segment Profitability Profitability by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):

837465_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	The decrease in reconciling items in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a $17.7 million gain recognized in the second quarter of 2016 in connection with the sale of approximately 10.0% of the Company's investment in Topgolf, combined with decreases of $6.4 million in interest expense and $1.6 million in corporate stock compensation expense, partially offset by a $4.0 million increase in foreign currency exchange losses.
837465_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	Pre-tax income in the Company s golf clubs operating segment improved to $65.0 million for 2016 from $53.0 million for 2015.
837465_17_ITEM7_P60_S3	This increase was primarily due to an $18.3 million increase in net sales (as discussed above) which contributed to a $17.2 million increase in gross profit (or increase of 117 basis points in gross margin), partially offset by an increase of $5.2 million in operating expenses.
837465_17_ITEM7_P60_S4	The improvement in gross margin was primarily due to an increase of 129 basis points due to a reduction in costs, driven primarily by the favorable sourcing of raw materials, combined with improved operational efficiencies resulting from reduced fixed charges.
837465_17_ITEM7_P60_S5	Sales price and mix improved by 30 basis points primarily due to an increase in average selling prices, primarily within the irons category, partially offset by an increase in promotional activity year over year.
837465_17_ITEM7_P60_S6	Foreign currency translation had a negative impact to gross margin of 42 basis points due to the impact of changes in foreign currency rates on inventory held at foreign regions.

837465_17_ITEM7_P61_S2	The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to an increase in sales price and mix of 54 basis points due to the Chrome Soft golf balls launched in the current year at higher average selling prices compared to the Chrome Soft golf balls launched in the prior year.
837465_17_ITEM7_P61_S3	The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the Company's new apparel joint venture in Japan established during the third quarter of 2016.

837465_17_ITEM7_P68_S5	This decrease was primarily due to lower average outstanding borrowings in 2015, partially offset by the recognition of $2.0 million of expense from the acceleration of debt issuance costs in connection with the exchange of the Company's convertible notes into shares of common stock during the current year (see Note 3 "Financing Arrangements" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).

837465_17_ITEM7_P76_S9	This $19.5 million decrease was primarily attributable to improved inventory management combined with the timing of inventory purchases as a result of a shift in product launch timing.
837465_17_ITEM7_P76_S10	Inventories as a percentage of the trailing 12 months net sales decreased to 21.7% as of December 31, 2016 compared to 24.8% as of December 31, 2015 .
837465_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources The information set forth in Note 3 Financing Arrangements , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, is incorporated herein by this reference.
837465_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	Liquidity The Company s principal sources of liquidity consist of its existing cash balances, funds expected to be generated from operations and its credit facilities.
837465_17_ITEM7_P78_S1	Based upon the Company s current cash balances, its estimates of funds expected to be generated from operations in 2017, and current and projected availability under its credit facilities, the Company believes that it will be able to finance current and planned operating requirements, capital expenditures, contractual obligations and commercial commitments for at least the next 12 months.
837465_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	The Company s ability to generate sufficient positive cash flows from operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including future economic trends and conditions, demand for the Company s products, foreign currency exchange rates, and other risks and uncertainties applicable to the Company and its business (see Risk Factors contained in Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K).
837465_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows to fund its business due to a decline in sales or otherwise and is unable to reduce its manufacturing costs and operating expenses to offset such decline, the Company will need to increase its reliance on its credit facilities for needed liquidity.
837465_17_ITEM7_P79_S2	If the credit facilities are not then available or sufficient and the Company could not secure alternative financing arrangements, the Company s future operations would be materially adversely affected.
837465_17_ITEM7_P79_S3	To further enhance its liquidity position and/or make strategic investments, the Company may obtain additional financing, which could consist of equity or debt financing from public and/or private credit and capital markets.
837465_17_ITEM7_P79_S4	In 2014, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Commission for the future sale of up to $200.0 million of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, rights, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and units.
837465_17_ITEM7_P79_S5	The securities may be offered from time to time, separately or together, directly by the Company or through underwriters, dealers or agents at amounts, prices, interest rates and other terms to be determined at the time of the offering.
837465_17_ITEM7_P79_S6	The registration statement is scheduled to expire on August 11, 2017.
837465_17_ITEM7_P79_S7	In April 2016, the Company sold approximately 10.0%, or $5.8 million, of its preferred shares in Topgolf in connection with Topgolf's share repurchase program, and received cash proceeds of $23.4 million.
837465_17_ITEM7_P79_S8	For further discussion, see Note 6 "Investments" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2016 , approximately 43% of the Company s total cash is held in regions outside of the United States.
837465_17_ITEM7_P79_S9	If the Company were to repatriate such cash, outside of settling intercompany balances during the normal course of operations, it would need to accrue and pay incremental U.S. federal and state income taxes, reduced by the current amount of available U.S. federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
837465_17_ITEM7_P79_S10	The Company has not, nor does it intend to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with its domestic debt service requirements.
837465_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	The Company intends to repatriate the undistributed earnings from these two entities to the United States at the time that the winding-down process has been completed.
837465_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	As of December 31, 2016, the Company has accrued for the estimated incremental U.S. income taxes related to reversing its permanent indefinite reinvestment assertion.
837465_17_ITEM7_P80_S2	However, these incremental U.S. income taxes are expected to be offset by the utilization of the Company's cumulative U.S. net operating losses.
837465_17_ITEM7_P80_S3	Except for the Company's foreign subsidiaries in Thailand and Malaysia, the Company considers the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon.
837465_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	In August 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a $50.0 million share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase shares of its common stock in the open market or in private transactions, subject to the Company s assessment of market conditions and buying opportunities.
837465_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	The repurchases are made consistent with the terms of the Company's ABL Facility which defines the amount of stock that can be repurchased.
837465_17_ITEM7_P81_S2	The repurchase program will remain in effect until completed or until terminated by the Board of Directors.
837465_17_ITEM7_P81_S3	During 2016, the Company repurchased approximately 572,000 shares of its common stock under the 2014 repurchase program at an average cost per share of $8.99 for a total cost of $5.1 million .
837465_17_ITEM7_P81_S4	Included in these repurchases are shares the Company acquired to satisfy the Company's tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting and settlement of employee restricted stock unit awards.
837465_17_ITEM7_P81_S5	The Company s repurchases of shares of common stock are recorded at cost and result in a reduction of shareholders equity.
837465_17_ITEM7_P81_S6	As of December 31, 2016, the total amount remaining under the repurchase authorization was $41.9 million.
837465_17_ITEM7_P81_S7	The following table summarizes certain significant cash obligations as of December 31, 2016 that will affect the Company s future liquidity (in millions):
837465_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	(1) Amounts represent future minimum lease payments.
837465_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	Capital lease obligations are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
837465_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	(2) The Company leases certain warehouse, distribution and office facilities, vehicles and office equipment under operating leases.
837465_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	The amounts presented in this line item represent commitments for minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases.
837465_17_ITEM7_P83_S2	(3) During the normal course of its business, the Company enters into agreements to purchase goods and services, including purchase commitments for production materials, endorsement agreements with professional golfers and other endorsers, employment and consulting agreements, and intellectual property licensing agreements pursuant to which the Company is required to pay royalty fees.
837465_17_ITEM7_P83_S3	the Company s sales levels, and reductions in payment obligations if designated minimum performance criteria are not achieved.
837465_17_ITEM7_P83_S4	The amounts listed approximate minimum purchase obligations, base compensation and guaranteed minimum royalty payments the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements.
837465_17_ITEM7_P83_S5	The actual amounts paid under some of these agreements may be higher or lower than the amounts included.
837465_17_ITEM7_P83_S6	In the aggregate, the actual amount paid under these obligations is likely to be higher than the amounts listed as a result of the variable nature of these obligations.
837465_17_ITEM7_P83_S7	In addition, the Company also enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders or other documentation or that are undocumented except for an invoice.
837465_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	purchase obligations are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected in this line item.
837465_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	(4) Amount represents the current and non-current portions of uncertain income tax positions as recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 .
837465_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	Amount excludes uncertain income tax positions that the Company would be able to offset against deferred taxes.
837465_17_ITEM7_P85_S2	For further discussion, see Note 9 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. (5) Amount represents accrued employee incentive compensation expense earned in 2016, and paid in February 2017.
837465_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	During its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions.
837465_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	These include (i) intellectual property indemnities to the Company s customers and licensees in connection with the use, sale and/or license of Company products or trademarks, (ii) indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facilities or leases, (iii) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to the goods or services provided to the Company or based on the negligence or willful misconduct of the Company and (iv) indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts.
837465_17_ITEM7_P86_S2	In addition, the Company has made contractual commitments to each of its officers and certain other employees providing for severance payments upon the termination of employment.
837465_17_ITEM7_P86_S3	The Company also has consulting agreements that provide for payment of nominal fees upon the issuance of patents and/or the commercialization of research results.
837465_17_ITEM7_P86_S4	The Company has also issued guarantees in the form of standby letters of credit in the amount of $ 0.8 million as security for contingent liabilities under certain workers compensation insurance policies.
837465_17_ITEM7_P86_S5	The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases may be indefinite.
837465_17_ITEM7_P86_S6	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be obligated to make.
837465_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	Historically, costs incurred to settle claims related to indemnities have not been material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	In addition, the Company believes the likelihood is remote that payments under the commitments and guarantees described above will have a material effect on the Company s financial condition.
837465_17_ITEM7_P87_S2	The fair value of indemnities, commitments and guarantees that the Company issued during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 was not material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_17_ITEM7_P87_S3	In addition to the contractual obligations listed above, the Company s liquidity could also be adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome with respect to claims and litigation that the Company is subject to from time to time.
837465_17_ITEM7_P87_S4	See Note 10 Commitments Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Capital Resources The Company does not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures.
837465_17_ITEM7_P87_S5	The Company has no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K .
837465_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions of its international subsidiaries, including certain balance sheet exposures (payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies) (see Note 15 Derivatives and Hedging in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	In addition, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from the translation of the operating results of the Company s international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	that are denominated primarily in British Pounds, Euros, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Korean Won.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	For most currencies, the Company is a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefits from a weaker U.S. dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which the Company transacts significant amounts of business.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Foreign currency forward contracts are used only to meet the Company s objectives of offsetting gains and losses from foreign currency exchange exposures with gains and losses from foreign currency contracts in order to reduce foreign currency volatility in earnings.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The extent to which the Company s activities to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates varies is based upon many factors, including the amount of transactions being hedged.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The Company generally only hedges a limited portion of its international transactions.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The Company does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for speculative purposes.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Foreign currency forward contracts generally mature within 12 to 15 months from their inception.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P3_S4	Beginning in January 2015, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts in the form of cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, to help mitigate the foreign currency exchange exposures discussed above.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P3_S5	The Company did not have instruments that qualified for hedge accounting in 2014.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P3_S6	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the notional amounts of these contacts were approximately $27.3 million and $55.9 million , respectively.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The reporting of gains and losses on these cash flow hedging instruments depends on whether the gains or losses are effective at offsetting changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged items.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The Company uses the hypothetical derivative method to measure the effectiveness of the foreign currency forward contracts and evaluates the effectiveness on a quarterly basis.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The effective portion of the gains and losses on these hedging instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income until recognized in earnings in the period that the hedged transactions take place.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Any ineffective portion of the gains and losses from these hedging instruments is recognized in earnings immediately.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The Company estimates the fair values of foreign currency forward contracts based on pricing models using current market rates.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P6_S1	At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the notional amounts of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments used to help mitigate the exposure discussed above were approximately $14.8 million , $43.1 million and $62.9 million , respectively.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The Company estimates the fair values of foreign currency forward contracts based on pricing models using current market rates, and records these contracts on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded immediately in earnings in other income (expense).
837465_17_ITEM7A_P7_S0	As part of the Company s risk management procedure, a sensitivity analysis model is used to measure the potential loss in future earnings of market-sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates or foreign currency values.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The sensitivity analysis model quantifies the estimated potential effect of unfavorable movements of 10% in foreign currencies to which the Company was exposed at December 31, 2016 through its foreign currency forward contracts.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The estimated maximum one-day loss from the Company s foreign currency forward contracts, calculated using the sensitivity analysis model described above, was $2.9 million at December 31, 2016 .
837465_17_ITEM7A_P7_S3	The Company believes that such a hypothetical loss from its foreign currency forward contracts would be partially offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The sensitivity analysis model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in earnings that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P8_S1	It also does not represent the maximum possible loss that may occur.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P8_S2	Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The Company is exposed to interest rate risk from its credit facilities.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Outstanding borrowings under the Company's credit facilities accrue interest as described in Note 3 Financing Arrangements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. As part of the Company s risk management procedures, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of unfavorable changes in interest rates on the Company s cash flows.
837465_17_ITEM7A_P9_S2	The sensitivity analysis quantified that the incremental expense incurred by a 10% increase in interest rates would be $0.1 million over a 12-month period.
837465_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
837465_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act).
837465_17_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 .
837465_17_ITEM9A_P0_S3	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in its report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013).
837465_17_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Based on that assessment, management concluded that as of December 31, 2016 , the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the COSO criteria.
837465_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting .
837465_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016 , there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
837465_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
837465_17_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
837465_17_ITEM9A_P1_S4	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.
837465_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Callaway Golf Company Carlsbad, California We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Callaway Golf Company and its subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
837465_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
837465_17_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
837465_17_ITEM9A_P2_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
837465_17_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
837465_17_ITEM9A_P2_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
837465_17_ITEM9A_P2_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
837465_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
837465_17_ITEM9A_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
837465_17_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
837465_17_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
837465_17_ITEM9A_P3_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
837465_17_ITEM9A_P3_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 , and our report dated February 24, 2017 , expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

837465_17_ITEM15_P25_S0	Title Dated as of Principal Executive Officer:
837465_17_ITEM15_P26_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Callaway Golf Company Carlsbad, California We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Callaway Golf Company and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and shareholders' equity, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 .
837465_17_ITEM15_P26_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
837465_17_ITEM15_P26_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
837465_17_ITEM15_P26_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
837465_17_ITEM15_P26_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
837465_17_ITEM15_P27_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
837465_17_ITEM15_P27_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
837465_17_ITEM15_P27_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
837465_17_ITEM15_P27_S3	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Callaway Golf Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
837465_17_ITEM15_P27_S4	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2017 , expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

837465_17_ITEM15_P31_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
837465_17_ITEM15_P32_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
837465_17_ITEM15_P33_S0	The Company Callaway Golf Company ( Callaway Golf or the Company ), a Delaware corporation, together with its subsidiaries, designs, manufactures and sells high quality golf clubs (drivers, fairway woods, hybrids, irons, wedges and putters), golf balls, golf bags and other golf-related accessories.
837465_17_ITEM15_P33_S1	The Company generally sells its products to golf retailers (including pro shops at golf courses and off-course retailers), sporting goods retailers, Internet retailers and mass merchants, directly and through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and to third-party distributors in the United States and in over 100 countries around the world.
837465_17_ITEM15_P33_S2	The Company also sells pre-owned Callaway Golf products through its website www.callawaygolfpreowned.com and sells new Callaway Golf products through its websites www.callawaygolf.com and www.odysseygolf.com.
837465_17_ITEM15_P33_S3	In addition, the Company licenses its trademarks and service marks in exchange for a royalty fee to third parties for use on golf related accessories including golf apparel and footwear, golf gloves, prescription eyewear and practice aids.
837465_17_ITEM15_P33_S4	In January 2017 the Company completed the acquisition of OGIO International, Inc., a leading manufacturer of high quality bags, accessories and apparel in the golf and lifestyle categories.
837465_17_ITEM15_P33_S5	This acquisition is expected to enhance the Company's presence in golf while also providing a platform for future growth in the lifestyle category.
837465_17_ITEM15_P34_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its domestic and foreign subsidiaries.
837465_17_ITEM15_P34_S1	All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
837465_17_ITEM15_P35_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
837465_17_ITEM15_P35_S1	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
837465_17_ITEM15_P35_S2	Examples of such estimates include provisions for warranty, uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence, sales returns, tax contingencies, estimates on the valuation of share-based awards and recoverability of long-lived assets and investments.
837465_17_ITEM15_P35_S3	Actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
837465_17_ITEM15_P35_S4	On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its estimates to ensure that these estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business or as new information becomes available.
837465_17_ITEM15_P35_S5	This amendment is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
837465_17_ITEM15_P35_S6	The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein.
837465_17_ITEM15_P35_S7	The Company anticipates that the adoption of this ASU will impact the Company's effective tax rate as a result of the recognition of excess tax benefits or deficiencies in the income tax provision rather than in additional paid in capital in the period in which share-based payment transactions vest, are settled or expire.
837465_17_ITEM15_P35_S8	In addition, the classification of excess tax benefits or deficiencies on the statement of cash flows will be included in operating activities and will no longer be classified separately as a financing activity.
837465_17_ITEM15_P35_S9	The adoption of this ASU could also impact the number of shares that the Company would need to repurchase for employee payroll tax withholding purposes.
837465_17_ITEM15_P35_S10	The Company does not expect to change its accounting policy on the recognition of estimated forfeitures.
837465_17_ITEM15_P35_S11	The amendment clarifies when it is acceptable to recognize the unredeemed portion of prepaid gift cards into income, and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
837465_17_ITEM15_P36_S0	will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
837465_17_ITEM15_P36_S1	As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $1,273,000 of deferred revenue related to unredeemed gift cards.
837465_17_ITEM15_P37_S0	Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.
837465_17_ITEM15_P37_S1	Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged and lessees will no longer be provided with a source of off-balance sheet financing.
837465_17_ITEM15_P37_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
837465_17_ITEM15_P38_S0	Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.
837465_17_ITEM15_P38_S1	The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented.
837465_17_ITEM15_P38_S2	Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach.
837465_17_ITEM15_P38_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
837465_17_ITEM15_P38_S4	The amendment requires (i) equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, (ii) public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes and (iii) separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables).
837465_17_ITEM15_P38_S5	This amendment eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost.
837465_17_ITEM15_P38_S6	This amendment is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
837465_17_ITEM15_P39_S0	As of December 31, 2016, the Company had an investment in Topgolf International, Inc. of $48,997,000 that was accounted for at cost in accordance with ASC Topic 325, Investments Other.
837465_17_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Company believes the fair value of its investment in Topgolf to be significantly higher than its cost basis (see Note 6 ).
837465_17_ITEM15_P39_S2	If there are any observable price changes related to this investment or a similar investment of the same issuer in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, the Company would be required to write this investment up or down to its estimated fair value, which could have a significant effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations.
837465_17_ITEM15_P40_S0	Topic 330, Inventory, currently requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market.
837465_17_ITEM15_P40_S1	Market could be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin.
837465_17_ITEM15_P41_S0	The amendments apply to inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost.
837465_17_ITEM15_P41_S1	An entity should measure in-scope inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
837465_17_ITEM15_P41_S2	Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
837465_17_ITEM15_P41_S3	The amendments in this update more closely align the measurement of inventory in GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting Standards.
837465_17_ITEM15_P41_S4	For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
837465_17_ITEM15_P41_S5	The amendments should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.
837465_17_ITEM15_P41_S6	The adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
837465_17_ITEM15_P42_S0	This ASU is intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures, and provides guidance to an organization s management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes.
837465_17_ITEM15_P42_S1	Until the issuance of this ASU, U.S. GAAP lacked guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures.
837465_17_ITEM15_P42_S2	The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
837465_17_ITEM15_P42_S3	The adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
837465_17_ITEM15_P43_S0	nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts).
837465_17_ITEM15_P43_S1	This ASU will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, "Revenue Recognition," and most industry-specific guidance.
837465_17_ITEM15_P43_S2	In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer (e.g., assets within the scope of Topic 360, "Property, Plant, and Equipment," and intangible assets within the scope of Topic 350, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other") are amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement (including the constraint on revenue) in this ASU.
837465_17_ITEM15_P44_S0	The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
837465_17_ITEM15_P44_S1	The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
837465_17_ITEM15_P44_S2	Early adoption is permitted only for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
837465_17_ITEM15_P44_S3	The Company does not intend to early adopt the new guidance, and is currently evaluating the adoption method and the impact the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
837465_17_ITEM15_P45_S0	Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized, in general, as products are shipped to customers, and at point of sale for transactions in retail locations, net of an allowance for sales returns and sales programs in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.
837465_17_ITEM15_P45_S1	In certain cases, the Company recognizes sales when products are received by customers.
837465_17_ITEM15_P45_S2	The criteria for recognition of revenue are met when persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and both title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
837465_17_ITEM15_P46_S0	Sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through of products.
837465_17_ITEM15_P46_S1	The Company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings.
837465_17_ITEM15_P47_S0	Sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program, management s forecast of future product demand, and historical customer participation in similar programs.
837465_17_ITEM15_P47_S1	The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to the Company s allowance for sales returns:
837465_17_ITEM15_P48_S0	Revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed.
837465_17_ITEM15_P48_S1	In addition, the Company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws.
837465_17_ITEM15_P48_S2	The Company s gift cards have no expiration date.
837465_17_ITEM15_P48_S3	To determine when redemption is remote, the Company analyzes an aging of unredeemed cards (based on the date the card was last used or the activation date if the card has never been used) and compares that information with historical redemption trends.
837465_17_ITEM15_P48_S4	The deferred revenue associated with outstanding gift cards increased to $1,273,000 at December 31, 2016 from $1,119,000 at December 31, 2015 .
837465_17_ITEM15_P48_S5	The amounts are recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
837465_17_ITEM15_P49_S0	Royalty income is recorded in net sales as underlying product sales occur, subject to certain minimums, in accordance with the related licensing arrangements.
837465_17_ITEM15_P49_S1	The Company recognized royalty income under its various licensing agreements of $7,622,000 , $8,062,000 and $8,881,000 during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
837465_17_ITEM15_P50_S0	Warranty Policy The Company has a stated two -year warranty policy for its golf clubs.
837465_17_ITEM15_P50_S1	The Company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded.
837465_17_ITEM15_P50_S2	In estimating its future warranty obligations, the Company considers various relevant factors, including the Company s stated warranty policies and practices, the historical frequency of claims, and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty.
837465_17_ITEM15_P51_S0	The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to the Company s reserve for warranty expense:
837465_17_ITEM15_P52_S0	Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability (the exit price) in the principal and most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
837465_17_ITEM15_P52_S1	The Company measures and discloses the fair value of nonfinancial and financial assets and liabilities utilizing a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to a fair value measurement are considered to be observable or unobservable in a marketplace.
837465_17_ITEM15_P52_S2	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions.
837465_17_ITEM15_P52_S3	This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.
837465_17_ITEM15_P52_S4	The measurement of assets and liabilities at fair value are classified using the following three-tier hierarchy:
837465_17_ITEM15_P52_S5	Level 1 : Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 : Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and Level 3 :
837465_17_ITEM15_P53_S0	Fair value measurements derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
837465_17_ITEM15_P53_S1	The Company measures fair value using a set of standardized procedures that are outlined herein for all assets and liabilities which are required to be measured at fair value.
837465_17_ITEM15_P53_S2	When available, the Company utilizes quoted market prices from an independent third-party source to determine fair value and classifies such items in Level 1.
837465_17_ITEM15_P53_S3	In some instances where a market price is available, but the instrument is in an inactive or over-the-counter market, the Company consistently applies the dealer (market maker) pricing estimate and uses a midpoint approach on bid and ask prices from financial institutions to determine the reasonableness of these estimates.
837465_17_ITEM15_P53_S4	Assets and liabilities subject to this fair value valuation approach are typically classified as Level 2.
837465_17_ITEM15_P54_S0	Items valued using internally-generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
837465_17_ITEM15_P54_S1	As a result, the asset or liability could be classified in either Level 2 or Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.
837465_17_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow valuation model whenever applicable to derive a fair value measurement on long-lived assets and goodwill and intangible assets.
837465_17_ITEM15_P55_S1	The Company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate.
837465_17_ITEM15_P55_S2	The Company also considers its counterparty s and own credit risk on derivatives and other liabilities measured at their fair value.
837465_17_ITEM15_P56_S0	Advertising Costs The Company's primary advertising costs are from television and print media advertisements.
837465_17_ITEM15_P56_S1	The Company s policy is to expense advertising costs, including production costs, as incurred.
837465_17_ITEM15_P56_S2	Advertising expenses for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were $59,003,000 , $57,392,000 and $55,502,000 , respectively.

837465_17_ITEM15_P57_S1	Research and development costs for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were $33,318,000 , $ 33,213,000 and $ 31,285,000 , respectively.
837465_17_ITEM15_P58_S0	Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions A significant portion of the Company s business is conducted outside of the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
837465_17_ITEM15_P58_S1	As a result, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on the Company s financial results.
837465_17_ITEM15_P59_S0	Revenues and expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the average exchange rate for the period.
837465_17_ITEM15_P59_S1	Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date.
837465_17_ITEM15_P59_S2	Gains and losses from assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity on which they reside are generally recognized currently in the Company's statements of operations.
837465_17_ITEM15_P59_S3	Gains and losses from the translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (see Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income policy below).

837465_17_ITEM15_P60_S0	Derivatives and Hedging In order to mitigate the impact of foreign currency translation on transactions, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts that are accounted for as non-designated and designated hedges pursuant to ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ("ASC Topic 815").
837465_17_ITEM15_P60_S1	ASC Topic 815 requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, measure those instruments at fair value and recognize changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change unless the derivative qualifies as designated cash flow hedge that offsets certain exposures.
837465_17_ITEM15_P61_S0	Certain criteria must be satisfied in order for derivative financial instruments to be classified and accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
837465_17_ITEM15_P61_S1	Gains and losses from the remeasurement of qualifying cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and released into earnings as a component of cost of goods sold or net sales during the period in which the hedged transaction takes place.
837465_17_ITEM15_P61_S2	Gains and losses on the ineffective portion of hedges (hedges that do not meet accounting requirements due to ineffectiveness) and derivatives that are not elected for hedge accounting treatment are immediately recorded in earnings as a component of other income (expense).
837465_17_ITEM15_P62_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less.
837465_17_ITEM15_P62_S1	The Company records its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.
837465_17_ITEM15_P62_S2	This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts.
837465_17_ITEM15_P63_S0	An estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, the customer s financial condition and current economic trends, all of which are subject to change.
837465_17_ITEM15_P63_S1	Actual uncollected amounts have historically been consistent with the Company s expectations.
837465_17_ITEM15_P63_S2	In general, the Company has trade insurance to mitigate the risk of uncollectible accounts on its outstanding accounts receivable.
837465_17_ITEM15_P63_S3	The Company considers this insurance coverage when estimating its provision for uncollectible accounts.
837465_17_ITEM15_P63_S4	Insurance claim recoveries from this trade insurance are applied to the Company s outstanding accounts receivable or are recorded as a reduction to bad debt expense in the period in which the claim is received.
837465_17_ITEM15_P63_S5	In October 2016, the Company s trade insurance policy expired and as of December 31, 2016, the Company did not have trade insurance on its outstanding accounts receivable.
837465_17_ITEM15_P64_S0	The decrease in the allowance for estimated losses in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of a significant bad debt recovery recognized in 2015.
837465_17_ITEM15_P64_S1	The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to the Company s allowance for doubtful accounts:
837465_17_ITEM15_P65_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value.
837465_17_ITEM15_P65_S1	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
837465_17_ITEM15_P66_S0	The inventory balance, which includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs, is recorded net of an estimate for obsolete or unmarketable inventory.
837465_17_ITEM15_P66_S1	This estimate is based upon current inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience as well as management s estimates of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand, all of which are subject to change.
837465_17_ITEM15_P67_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
837465_17_ITEM15_P68_S0	Normal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

837465_17_ITEM15_P71_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-35, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , the Company assesses potential impairments of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying value may not be recoverable.
837465_17_ITEM15_P71_S1	An impairment charge would be recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.
837465_17_ITEM15_P71_S2	The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group.
837465_17_ITEM15_P72_S0	Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets, which consist of trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, patents and other intangible assets, were acquired in connection with the acquisition of Odyssey Sports, Inc. in 1997, FrogTrader, Inc. in 2004, and certain foreign distributors.
837465_17_ITEM15_P73_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events indicate that an impairment exists.
837465_17_ITEM15_P73_S1	The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets over their estimated fair value.
837465_17_ITEM15_P73_S2	If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded.
837465_17_ITEM15_P73_S3	To determine fair value, the Company uses its internal discounted cash flow estimates, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals when appropriate.
837465_17_ITEM15_P73_S4	The Company completed its annual impairment test and fair value analysis of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2016 , and the estimated fair values of the Company s reporting units in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Korea, as well as the estimated fair values of certain trade names and trademarks, significantly exceeded their carrying values.
837465_17_ITEM15_P73_S5	As a result, no impairment was recorded as of December 31, 2016 .
837465_17_ITEM15_P74_S0	Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-35 discussed above.

837465_17_ITEM15_P76_S1	ASC Topic 718 further requires a reduction in share-based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_17_ITEM15_P77_S0	The forfeiture rate used by the Company is based on historical forfeiture trends.
837465_17_ITEM15_P77_S1	If actual forfeiture rates are not consistent with the Company s estimates, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods.
837465_17_ITEM15_P78_S0	Performance share units are stock-based awards in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on the Company's performance against specified goals that are measured over a designated performance period from the date of grant.
837465_17_ITEM15_P78_S1	These performance goals are established by the Company at the beginning of the performance period.

837465_17_ITEM15_P137_S1	Upon remittance, certain foreign countries impose withholding taxes, subject to certain limitations, for use as credits against the Company s U.S. tax liability, if any.
837465_17_ITEM15_P137_S2	If the foreign earnings were remitted, the Company would need to accrue an additional income tax liability.
837465_17_ITEM15_P137_S3	However, the Company would also be allowed a credit against the Company s U.S. tax liability for the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions.
837465_17_ITEM15_P137_S4	The Company expects the net impact on the Company s U.S. tax liability to be insignificant.

837465_17_ITEM15_P158_S3	The expected life of the Company s options is based on evaluations of historical employee exercise behavior, forfeitures, cancellations and other factors.
837465_17_ITEM15_P158_S4	The valuation model applied in this calculation utilizes highly subjective assumptions that could potentially change over time.
837465_17_ITEM15_P158_S5	Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option.
837465_17_ITEM15_P158_S6	Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by the employee holding the option.

837465_17_ITEM15_P170_S0	Phantom Stock Units Phantom stock units granted under the 2004 Incentive Plan are a form of share-based awards that are indexed to the Company s stock and are settled in cash.
837465_17_ITEM15_P170_S1	Because phantom stock units are settled in cash, compensation expense recognized over the vesting period will vary based on changes in fair value.
837465_17_ITEM15_P171_S0	Fair value is remeasured at the end of each interim reporting period based on the closing price of the Company s common stock.

837465_17_ITEM15_P176_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments Certain of the Company s financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis.
837465_17_ITEM15_P177_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability (the exit price) in the principal and most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
837465_17_ITEM15_P177_S1	Assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified using the three-tier hierarchy (see Note 2 ).
837465_17_ITEM15_P177_S2	The following table summarizes the valuation of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts (see Note 15 ) that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):
837465_17_ITEM15_P178_S0	The fair value of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts is based on observable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
837465_17_ITEM15_P178_S1	Observable inputs include broker quotes, daily market foreign currency rates and forward pricing curves.
837465_17_ITEM15_P178_S2	Remeasurement gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income, and in other income (expense) for non-designated foreign currency forward contracts (see Note 15).
837465_17_ITEM15_P179_S0	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable at December 31, 2016 and 2015 are categorized within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy due to the short-term nature of these balances.
837465_17_ITEM15_P179_S1	The table below illustrates information about fair value relating to the Company s financial assets and liabilities that are recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , as well as the fair value of contingent contracts that represent financial instruments (in thousands).
837465_17_ITEM15_P180_S0	(1) The carrying value of the money market funds approximates fair value as the funds are highly liquid and short-term in nature.
837465_17_ITEM15_P180_S1	The funds seek to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per share, and the market value per share of these funds are available in active markets.
837465_17_ITEM15_P180_S2	As such, they are categorized within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
837465_17_ITEM15_P181_S0	The money market funds accrue dividends, which are reinvested and reflected in the carrying value as of December 31, 2016 .
837465_17_ITEM15_P181_S1	(2) The carrying value of amounts outstanding under the Japan ABL and Primary Asset-Based Revolving credit facilities approximate the fair value due to the short term nature of these obligations.
837465_17_ITEM15_P182_S0	The fair value of this debt is categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
837465_17_ITEM15_P182_S1	See Note 3 for information on the Company's credit facilities, including certain risks and uncertainties related thereto.
837465_17_ITEM15_P182_S2	(3) The carrying value of the Company's standby letters of credit approximates the fair value as they represent the Company s contingent obligation to perform in accordance with the underlying contracts.

837465_17_ITEM15_P183_S2	In 2016, 2015, and 2014, the Company did not have any significant assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition.
837465_17_ITEM15_P184_S0	Derivatives and Hedging In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions of its international subsidiaries.
837465_17_ITEM15_P184_S1	As part of its strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company uses designated cash flow hedges and non-designated hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency translation on transactions that are denominated primarily in Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Euros, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Korean Won.
837465_17_ITEM15_P184_S2	The Company accounts for its foreign currency forward contracts in accordance with ASC Topic 815.
837465_17_ITEM15_P184_S3	ASC Topic 815 requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, the measurement of those instruments at fair value and the recognition of changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change, unless the derivative qualifies as a designated cash flow hedge that offsets certain exposures.
837465_17_ITEM15_P184_S4	Certain criteria must be satisfied in order for derivative financial instruments to be classified and accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
837465_17_ITEM15_P184_S5	Gains and losses from the remeasurement of qualifying cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and released into earnings as a component of cost of goods sold or net sales during the period in which the hedged transaction takes place.
837465_17_ITEM15_P184_S6	Gains and losses on the ineffective portion of hedges (hedges that do not meet accounting requirements due to ineffectiveness) and derivatives that are not elected for hedge accounting treatment are immediately recorded in earnings as a component of other income (expense).
837465_17_ITEM15_P185_S0	Foreign currency forward contracts are used only to meet the Company s objectives of minimizing variability in the Company s operating results arising from foreign exchange rate movements.
837465_17_ITEM15_P186_S0	The Company utilizes counterparties for its derivative instruments that it believes are credit-worthy at the time the transactions are entered into and the Company closely monitors the credit ratings of these counterparties.
837465_17_ITEM15_P186_S1	The following table summarizes the fair value of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts as well as the location of the asset and/or liability on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):
837465_17_ITEM15_P187_S0	Fair Value Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments:
837465_17_ITEM15_P188_S0	Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:
837465_17_ITEM15_P189_S0	Fair Value Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments:
837465_17_ITEM15_P190_S0	Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:
837465_17_ITEM15_P191_S0	The Company's foreign currency forward contracts are subject to a master netting agreement with each respective counterparty bank and are therefore net settled at their maturity date.
837465_17_ITEM15_P191_S1	Although the Company has the legal right of offset under the master netting agreements, the Company elected not to present these contracts on a net settlement amount basis, and therefore present these contracts on a gross basis on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
837465_17_ITEM15_P191_S2	Cash Flow Hedging Instruments Beginning in January 2015, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts designated as qualifying cash flow hedges to help mitigate the Company's foreign currency exposure on intercompany sales of inventory to its foreign subsidiaries.
837465_17_ITEM15_P191_S3	These contracts generally mature within 12 to 15 months from their inception.
837465_17_ITEM15_P191_S4	At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the notional amounts of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedge instruments were approximately $27,325,000 and $ 55,938,000 , respectively.
837465_17_ITEM15_P191_S5	The reporting of gains and losses on these cash flow hedging instruments depends on whether the gains or losses are effective at offsetting changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged items.
837465_17_ITEM15_P192_S0	The Company uses the hypothetical derivative method to measure the effectiveness of the foreign currency forward contracts and evaluates the effectiveness on a quarterly basis.
837465_17_ITEM15_P193_S0	The effective portion of the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income until recognized in earnings during the period that the hedged transactions take place.
837465_17_ITEM15_P193_S1	Any ineffective portion of the gains and losses from the hedging instruments is recognized in earnings immediately.
837465_17_ITEM15_P194_S0	The Company would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively (i) if it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item, (ii) when the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, (iii) if it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction being hedged by the derivative will not occur, (iv) if a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment, or (v) if it is determined that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate.
837465_17_ITEM15_P195_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its foreign currency forward contracts based on pricing models using current market rates.
837465_17_ITEM15_P195_S1	These contracts are classified under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy (see Note 14 ).
837465_17_ITEM15_P195_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company recorded a net loss of $538,000 in other comprehensive income (loss) related to its hedging activities.
837465_17_ITEM15_P195_S3	Of this amount, for the year ended December 31, 2016 , net losses of $1,500,000 were relieved from other comprehensive income and recognized in cost of goods sold for the underlying intercompany sales that were recognized, and net losses of $1,014,000 were relieved from other comprehensive income and recognized in net sales for the underlying third party sales.
837465_17_ITEM15_P195_S4	There were no ineffective gains or losses recognized during 2016.
837465_17_ITEM15_P196_S0	other income (expense) as a result of hedge ineffectiveness, of which $576,000 was reclassified from other comprehensive income for hedges that no longer met the accounting requirements.
837465_17_ITEM15_P196_S1	Forward points of $220,000 were expensed as incurred.
837465_17_ITEM15_P196_S2	Based on the current valuation, the Company expects to reclassify net gains of $2,472,000 from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net earnings during the next 12 months.
837465_17_ITEM15_P196_S3	See Note 2 for a rollforward of accumulated other comprehensive income.
837465_17_ITEM15_P196_S4	The following tables summarize the net effect of all cash flow hedges on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):
837465_17_ITEM15_P197_S0	The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated as qualified hedging instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet exposures (payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies), as well as gains and losses resulting from the translation of the operating results of the Company s international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.
837465_17_ITEM15_P197_S1	These contracts generally mature within 12 months from their inception.
837465_17_ITEM15_P197_S2	At December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the notional amounts of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts used to mitigate the exposures discussed above were approximately $14,821,000 , $43,098,000 and $62,866,000 , respectively.
837465_17_ITEM15_P197_S3	The decrease in foreign currency forward contracts reflects the general timing of when the Company enters into these contracts.
837465_17_ITEM15_P197_S4	The Company estimates the fair values of foreign currency forward contracts based on pricing models using current market rates, and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the statement of operations.
837465_17_ITEM15_P197_S5	The foreign currency contracts are classified under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy (see Note 14 ).
837465_17_ITEM15_P197_S6	The following table summarizes the location of gains and losses on the consolidated statements of operations that were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, in addition to the derivative contract type (in thousands):

837465_17_ITEM15_P203_S1	Reconciling items represent unallocated corporate assets not segregated between the two segments including cash and cash equivalents, net accounts receivable, and deferred tax assets.
837465_17_ITEM15_P203_S2	The $190,924,000 increase in reconciling items in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a benefit of $156,600,000 related to the reversal of the Company's valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_17_ITEM15_P203_S3	This reversal was partially offset by the recognition of $15,974,000 in income taxes payable on the Company's U.S. business (see Note 9 ).
837465_17_ITEM15_P204_S0	(3) Additions to long-lived assets are comprised of purchases of property, plant and equipment by reporting segment.

837465_17_ITEM15_P349_S0	Recipient acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all tax-related items legally due by Recipient is and remains Recipient s responsibility and that Company and/or its Affiliates (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any tax-related items in connection with any aspect of the PSU grant, including the grant or vesting of the PSU, the subsequent sale of shares of Common Stock and the receipt of any dividends; and (2) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the PSU to reduce or eliminate Recipient s liability for tax-related items.

837465_17_ITEM15_P364_S3	The term Substantial Cause shall have the meaning ascribed such term in Recipient s employment agreement with the Company and, if Recipient does not have an employment agreement with the Company defining such term, then Cause shall mean Recipient s (1) failure to substantially perform his or her duties; (2) misconduct, including but not limited to, use or possession of illegal drugs during work and/or any other action that is damaging or detrimental in a significant manner to the Company; (3) conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony; or (4) failure to cooperate with, or any attempt to obstruct or improperly influence, any investigation authorized by the Board or any governmental or regulatory agency.

837465_17_ITEM15_P366_S0	Exhibit B Plan Overview The 2017 LTIP is a performance share unit (PSU) plan tied to measurement of currency neutral adjusted Earnings Per Share (Adjusted EPS) achievement over a one-, two-, and three-year period, with the earlier years weighted more heavily through the mechanics of the plan.
837465_17_ITEM15_P366_S1	A portion of the total award may be banked at the end of each year based on cumulative achievement, with final vesting not occurring until the end of the three-year performance period.
837465_17_ITEM15_P366_S2	Banked awards cannot be decreased based on performance in subsequent years.
837465_17_ITEM15_P366_S3	In addition, banked awards during year 1 are capped at 50% of the three-year target award, and cumulative banked awards after year 2 are capped at 80% of the three-year target award level.
837465_17_ITEM15_P366_S4	As such, target or above target awards can only be achieved if performance is at or above the three-year target performance goal.
837465_17_ITEM15_P367_S0	Performance Units PSUs are a contingent right to receive one share of Common Stock of the Company upon vesting of the award.
837465_17_ITEM15_P367_S1	The target number of PSUs is determined at the time of grant (after converting the target grant value to PSUs), and the PSUs are scheduled to vest on the third anniversary of the Effective Grant Date.
837465_17_ITEM15_P367_S2	The actual number of PSUs that vest at the end of the three years can vary from 0% to 200% of target, based on achievement of Company-wide performance objectives over the three-year period, as detailed below.
837465_17_ITEM15_P367_S3	Performance Measures and Goals Achievement will be determined using currency neutral Adjusted EPS over one-, two- and three-year performance periods beginning January 1, 2017, with performance measured at the end of each time period.
837465_17_ITEM15_P368_S0	Adjusted EPS shall mean calculated EPS after taking into account extraordinary items including (a) extraordinary, unusual and/or nonrecurring items of gain or loss, (b) gains or losses on the disposition of a business, (c) changes in tax or accounting regulations or laws, or (d) the effects of a merger, acquisition, or divestiture, (e) asset write-downs, (f) litigation or claim judgments or settlements, (g) any accruals for reorganization and restructuring programs, and (h) any extraordinary non-recurring items as described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, all of which must be identified in the audited financial statements, including footnotes, or in the Management s Discussion and Analysis section of the Company s annual report.
837465_17_ITEM15_P368_S1	Currency neutral shall mean the Company s Adjusted EPS for the applicable performance period in local currency translated at the Company s budgeted foreign currency exchange rates as set forth below:
837465_17_ITEM15_P369_S0	The annual and cumulative currency neutral Adjusted EPS targets and related award levels for each of the performance periods are summarized below.
837465_17_ITEM15_P369_S1	For years 1 and 2, goals above the target Adjusted EPS level are not applicable since payout levels above 100% can only be achieved if the three-year cumulative Adjusted EPS performance exceeds target.
837465_17_ITEM15_P369_S2	Further, the maximum award that can be achieved based solely on the first year s performance is 50% of target and the maximum award that can be achieved based on the combined performance in years 1 and 2 is 80% of target.
837465_17_ITEM15_P370_S0	1 Award levels are interpolated between the specified goals on an a straight line basis.
837465_17_ITEM15_P370_S1	2 Award levels above 100% are not available until the completion of the full three-year performance period.
837465_17_ITEM15_P371_S0	If the vesting of the PSUs is accelerated in connection with a Change in Control prior to the completion of the performance period for the performance metric pursuant to paragraph 4(a) of the Agreement, the PSUs will vest upon closing of such Change in Control and be paid out at the target performance level.

837465_17_ITEM15_P373_S0	The Committee shall certify the Company s currency neutral Adjusted EPS level for year 1 within the time prescribed by, and otherwise in compliance with, Section 162(m) of the Code Year 2:
837465_17_ITEM15_P374_S0	The interpolated year 2 cumulative performance level will be multiplied by the cumulative award cap for year 2 of 80% and then by the target number of PSUs, to determine the cumulative "banked" PSUs through year 2.
837465_17_ITEM15_P375_S0	The Committee shall certify the Company s currency neutral Adjusted EPS level for year 2 within the time prescribed by, and otherwise in compliance with, Section 162(m) of the Code Year 3:
837465_17_ITEM15_P376_S0	The PSUs are intended to constitute qualified performance-based compensation satisfying the requirements of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.162-27(e)(2) through (e)(5) and this Agreement shall be interpreted where necessary consistent with such intent.
837465_17_ITEM15_P376_S1	To the extent Recipient is a Covered Employee, the Committee for purposes of the administration of this Agreement shall consist of two or more members of the Board, each of whom is an outside director for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code.

837465_18_ITEM1_P28_S18	For certain risks associated with competition, see Risk Factors contained in Item 1A.
837465_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	In most of the regions where the Company conducts business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis.
837465_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	Weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year-round, except in a few markets, with many of the Company s on-course customers closing for the cold weather months.
837465_18_ITEM1_P29_S2	The Company s golf club and golf ball businesses are therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_18_ITEM1_P29_S3	In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its golf club and golf ball products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season.
837465_18_ITEM1_P29_S4	This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter.
837465_18_ITEM1_P29_S5	The Company s second-quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter.
837465_18_ITEM1_P29_S6	The Company s third-quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but can also include smaller new product launches, typically resulting in lower sales than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season.
837465_18_ITEM1_P29_S7	The Company s fourth-quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company s key regions.
837465_18_ITEM1_P29_S8	However, third-quarter sales can be affected by a mid-year product launch, and fourth-quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year.
837465_18_ITEM1_P29_S9	This seasonality, and therefore quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as well as weather conditions.
837465_18_ITEM1_P29_S10	In general, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company s sales from its Golf Clubs and Golf Balls operating segments and most, if not all, of its profitability from these segments generally occurs during the first half of the year.
837465_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	Sales of the Company's gear and accessories historically followed the golf clubs and golf balls seasonality, where most of the sales and profitability occurred during the first half of the year.
837465_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	With the Company's addition of the Japan apparel joint venture and the acquisition of OGIO as discussed above, the Company's seasonality shifted to the second half of the year as these businesses generate higher sales in the third and fourth quarters during the winter apparel season in Japan, and during the holiday season in the United States when sales of OGIO branded products are higher.
837465_18_ITEM1_P30_S2	Sales of the recently acquired TravisMathew brand of apparel and accessories are expected to be higher during the first half of the year, when the golf season is at its peak.
837465_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Company s operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of certain materials, substances and wastes and the remediation of environmental contaminants (collectively, Environmental Laws ).
837465_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	In the ordinary course of its manufacturing processes, the Company uses paints, chemical solvents and other materials, and generates waste by-products that are subject to these Environmental Laws.
837465_18_ITEM1_P31_S2	In addition, in connection with the Company's Top-Flite asset acquisition in 2003, the Company assumed certain monitoring and remediation obligations at its manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts.
837465_18_ITEM1_P31_S3	In February 2013, the Company sold this facility and leased back a reduced portion of the square footage that it believes is adequate for its ongoing golf ball manufacturing operations.
837465_18_ITEM1_P31_S4	As part of the terms of this sale, the Company assumed certain ongoing environmental remediation obligations.
837465_18_ITEM1_P31_S5	The Company endeavors to adhere to all applicable Environmental Laws and takes action as necessary to comply with these laws.
837465_18_ITEM1_P31_S6	The Company maintains an environmental and safety program and employs full-time environmental, health and safety professionals at its facilities located in Carlsbad, California, Chicopee, Massachusetts and Monterrey, Mexico.
837465_18_ITEM1_P31_S7	The environmental and safety program includes obtaining environmental permits as required, capturing and appropriately disposing of any waste by-products, tracking hazardous waste generation and disposal, air emissions, safety situations, material safety data sheet management, storm water management and recycling, and auditing and reporting on its compliance.
837465_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	Historically, the costs of environmental compliance have not had a material adverse effect on the Company s business.
837465_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	The Company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws.
837465_18_ITEM1_P32_S2	Sustainability The Company believes it is important to conduct its business in an environmentally, economically and socially sustainable manner.
837465_18_ITEM1_P32_S3	In this regard, the Company has an environmental sustainability program which focuses on the reductions of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, reductions of hazardous waste, reductions in water usage, improved recycling and development programs which involve the elimination or reduction of undesirable chemicals and solvents in favor of safer and environmentally preferred alternatives.
837465_18_ITEM1_P32_S4	These efforts cross divisional lines and are visible in the following areas within the Company:
837465_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	Supply chain management through Social, Safety and Environmental Responsibility audits of suppliers.
837465_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	The Company also has two existing programs focusing on the community: the Callaway Golf Company Foundation and the Callaway Golf Company Employee Community Giving Program.
837465_18_ITEM1_P33_S2	Through these programs the Company and its employees are able to give back to the community through monetary donations and by providing community services.
837465_18_ITEM1_P33_S3	Information on both of these programs is available on the Company s website www.callawaygolf.com.

837465_18_ITEM1_P55_S8	The information contained on the Company s website shall not be deemed to be incorporated into this report.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The Company s business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The Company urges you to carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those risks set forth under the heading entitled Important Notice to Investors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, and in other documents that the Company files with the Commission, before making any investment decision with respect to the Company s securities.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop, the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Under these circumstances, the trading prices of the Company s securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in the Company s securities.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Risks Related to the Company's Industry and Business A reduction in the number of rounds of golf played or in the number of golf participants could adversely affect the Company s sales.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The Company generates a large majority of its revenues from the sale of golf-related products, including golf clubs, golf balls and golf accessories.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The demand for golf-related products in general, and golf balls in particular, is directly related to the number of golf participants and the number of rounds of golf being played by these participants.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If golf participation continues to decrease or the number of rounds of golf played decreases, sales of the Company s products may be adversely affected.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	In the future, the overall dollar volume of the market for golf-related products may not grow or may decline.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P1_S4	In addition, the demand for golf products is also directly related to the popularity of magazines, cable channels and other media dedicated to golf, television coverage of golf tournaments and attendance at golf events.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P1_S5	The Company depends on the exposure of its products through advertising and the media or at golf tournaments and events.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	coverage of, or attendance at, golf tournaments and events or any significant reduction in the popularity of golf magazines or golf television channels, could reduce the visibility of the Company s brand and could adversely affect the Company s sales.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The Company may have limited opportunities for future growth in sales of golf clubs and golf balls.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	In order for the Company to significantly grow its sales of golf clubs or golf balls, the Company must either increase its share of the market for golf clubs or golf balls, develop markets in geographic regions historically underrepresented by the Company s products, or the overall market for golf clubs or golf balls must grow.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	The Company already has a significant share of worldwide sales of golf clubs and golf balls and the golf industry is very competitive.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P2_S4	As such, gaining incremental market share quickly or at all is difficult.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Therefore, opportunities for additional market share may be limited given the challenging competitive nature of the golf industry, and the overall dollar volume of worldwide sales of golf clubs or golf balls may not grow or may decline.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Unfavorable economic conditions could have a negative impact on consumer discretionary spending and therefore negatively impact the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The Company sells golf clubs, golf balls and golf accessories.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	These products are recreational in nature and are therefore discretionary purchases for consumers.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases of golf products during favorable economic conditions and when consumers are feeling confident and prosperous.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Discretionary spending is also affected by many other factors, including general business conditions, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxes and consumer confidence in future economic conditions.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Purchases of the Company s products could decline during periods when disposable income is lower, or during periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P3_S5	A significant or prolonged decline in general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that adversely affect consumer discretionary spending, whether in the United States or in the Company s international markets, could result in reduced sales of the Company s products, which in turn would have a negative impact on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P3_S6	A severe or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect the Company's customers financial condition, their levels of business activity and their ability to pay trade obligations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The Company primarily sells its products to golf equipment retailers directly and through wholly-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries, and to foreign distributors.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally requires no collateral from these customers.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	However, a severe or prolonged downturn in the general economy could adversely affect the retail golf equipment market which in turn, would negatively impact the liquidity and cash flows of the Company's customers, including the ability of such customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the Company's products and to pay their trade obligations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	This could result in increased delinquent or uncollectible accounts for some of the Company s customers.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	A failure by the Company s customers to pay on a timely basis a significant portion of outstanding account receivable balances would adversely impact the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The Company faces intense competition in each of its markets and if it is unable to maintain a competitive advantage, loss of market share, revenue, or profitability may result.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The golf club business is highly competitive, and is served by a number of well-established and well-financed companies with recognized brand names.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	New product introductions, price reductions, consignment sales, extended payment terms, closeouts, including closeouts of products that were recently commercially successful, and significant tour and advertising spending by competitors continue to generate intense market competition.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Furthermore, continued downward pressure on pricing in the market for new clubs could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s pre-owned club business as the gap narrows between the cost of a new club and a pre-owned club.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Successful marketing activities, discounted pricing, consignment sales, extended payment terms or new product introductions by competitors could negatively impact the Company s future sales.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The golf ball business is also highly competitive.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	There are a number of well-established and well-financed competitors, including one competitor with an estimated U.S. market share of over 50%.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	The Company s competitors continue to incur significant costs in the areas of advertising, tour and other promotional support.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	The Company believes that to be competitive, the Company also needs to continue to incur significant expenses in tour, advertising and promotional support.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Unless there is a change in competitive conditions, these competitive pressures and increased costs will continue to adversely affect the profitability of the Company s golf ball business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Company s accessories include golf bags, golf gloves, golf footwear, golf apparel and other items, as well as non-golf related items under the OGIO and TravisMathew brand names.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	in every region with respect to each of these product categories.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In most cases, the Company is not the market leader with respect to its accessory markets.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	If the Company is unable to successfully manage the frequent introduction of new products that satisfy changing consumer preferences, it could significantly and adversely impact its financial performance and prospects for future growth.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Company s main products, like those of its competitors, generally have life cycles of two years or less, with sales occurring at a much higher rate in the first year than in the second.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Factors driving these short product life cycles include the rapid introduction of competitive products and consumer demands for the latest technology.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In this marketplace, a substantial portion of the Company s annual revenues is generated each year by products that are in their first year of their product life cycle.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	These marketplace conditions raise a number of issues that the Company must successfully manage.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	For example, the Company must properly anticipate consumer preferences and design products that meet those preferences while also complying with significant restrictions imposed by the Rules of Golf (see further discussion of the Rules of Golf below) or its new products will not achieve sufficient market success to compensate for the usual decline in sales experienced by products already in the market.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Second, the Company s research and development and supply chain groups face constant pressures to design, develop, source and supply new products that perform better than their predecessors many of which incorporate new or otherwise untested technology, suppliers or inputs.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Third, for new products to generate equivalent or greater revenues than their predecessors, they must either maintain the same or higher sales levels with the same or higher pricing, or exceed the performance of their predecessors in one or both of those areas.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Fourth, the relatively short window of opportunity for launching and selling new products requires great precision in forecasting demand and assuring that supplies are ready and delivered during the critical selling periods.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Finally, the rapid changeover in products creates a need to monitor and manage the closeout of older products both at retail and in the Company s own inventory.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Should the Company not successfully manage the frequent introduction of new products that satisfy consumer demand, the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be significantly adversely affected.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The Company s golf club, golf ball, and gear and accessories business has a concentrated customer base.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The loss of one or more of the Company s top customers could have a significant effect on the Company s golf club, golf ball, and gear and accessories sales.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	On a consolidated basis, no single customer accounted for more than 10% , 8% and 9% of the Company s consolidated revenues in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The Company's top five customers accounted for approximately 21% , 22% and 26% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	With respect to the Company's segments, the Company's top five A loss of one or more of these customers could have a significant effect on the Company's net sales.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Prior period percentages have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation as the result of the change in operating segments as of January 1, 2017.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P12_S6	For further discussion, see Note 17 Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate the Company s credit risk, putting pressure on its margins and its ability to sell products.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The off course golf equipment retail markets in some countries, including the United States, are dominated by a few large retailers.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Certain of these retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Industry consolidation has occurred in recent years, and additional consolidation is possible.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	These situations may result in a concentration of the Company s credit risk with respect to its sales to such retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity or other financial difficulties, or file for bankruptcy, it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to the Company may not be paid.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P13_S4	This consolidation may also result in larger retailers gaining increased leverage, which may impact the Company s margins.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	substantially reduces their purchases of the Company s products, the Company may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for the Company s products to sustain the same level of sales.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Any reduction in sales by the Company s retailers could materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The Company s business depends on strong brands, and if the Company is not able to maintain and enhance the Company s brands, its sales may be adversely affected.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	The Company s brands have worldwide recognition, and the Company s success depends in large part on its ability to maintain and enhance its brand image and reputation.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Maintaining, promoting and enhancing the Company s brands may require the Company to make substantial investments in areas such as product innovation, product quality, intellectual property protection, marketing and employee training, and these investments may not have the desired impact on the Company s brand image and reputation.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S5	The Company s business could be adversely impacted if the Company fails to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of the Company s brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S6	In addition, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against the Company could damage its reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in the Company and reduce long term demand for its products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to its operations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S7	Also, as the Company seeks to grow its presence in existing, and expand into new, geographic or product markets, consumers in these markets may not accept the Company s brand image and may not be willing to pay a premium to purchase the Company s products as compared to other brands.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S8	The Company anticipates that as it continues to grow its presence in existing markets and expand into new markets, further developing the Company s brands may become increasingly difficult and expensive.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S9	If the Company is unable to maintain or further develop the image of the Company s brands, it could materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S10	International political instability and terrorist activities may decrease demand for the Company s products and disrupt its business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S11	Terrorist activities and armed conflicts could have an adverse effect on the United States or worldwide economy and could cause decreased demand for the Company s products as consumers attention and interests are diverted from golf and become focused on issues relating to these events.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S12	If such events disrupt domestic or international air, ground or sea shipments, or the operation of the Company s manufacturing facilities, the Company s ability to obtain the materials necessary to manufacture its products and to deliver customer orders would be harmed, which would have a significant adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S13	Such events can negatively impact tourism, which could adversely affect the Company s sales to retailers at resorts and other vacation destinations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S14	In addition, the occurrence of political instability and/or terrorist activities generally restricts travel to and from the affected areas, making it more difficult in general to manage the Company s international operations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S15	The Company s business could be harmed by the occurrence of natural disasters or pandemic diseases.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S16	The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, tsunami, fire, flood or hurricane, or the outbreak of a pandemic disease, could significantly adversely affect the Company s business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S17	A natural disaster or a pandemic disease could significantly adversely affect both the demand for the Company s products as well as the supply of the components used to make the Company s products.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S18	Demand for golf products also could be negatively affected as consumers in the affected regions restrict their recreational activities and as tourism to those areas declines.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S19	If the Company s suppliers experienced a significant disruption in their business as a result of a natural disaster or pandemic disease, the Company s ability to obtain the necessary components to make its products could be significantly adversely affected.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S20	In addition, the occurrence of a natural disaster or the outbreak of a pandemic disease generally restricts travel to and from the affected areas, making it more difficult in general to manage the Company s international operations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P14_S21	The Company s business and operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could result in fluctuations in its operating results and stock price.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The Company s first-quarter sales generally represent the Company s sell-in to the golf retail channel of its golf club products for the new golf season.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The Company s second and third-quarter sales generally represent reorder business for golf clubs.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Sales of golf clubs during the second and third quarters are significantly affected not only by the sell-through of the Company s products that were sold into the channel during the first quarter but also by the sell-through of products by the Company s competitors.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Retailers are sometimes reluctant to reorder the Company s products in significant quantities when they already have excess inventory of products of the Company or its competitors.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Therefore, golf ball sales tend to be greater in the second and third quarters, when the weather is good in most of the Company s key regions and the number of rounds played increase.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Golf ball sales are also stimulated by product introductions as the retail channel takes on initial supplies.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Like those of golf clubs, reorders of golf balls depend on the rate of sell-through.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The Company s sales during the fourth quarter are generally significantly less than those of the other quarters because in many of the Company s key regions fewer people are playing golf during that time of year due to cold weather.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Furthermore, the Company generally announces its new product line in the fourth quarter to allow retailers to plan for the new golf season.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Such early announcements of new products could cause golfers, and therefore the Company s customers, to defer purchasing additional golf equipment until the Company s new products are available.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Such deferments could have a material adverse effect on sales of the Company s current products or result in closeout sales at reduced prices.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P17_S5	The seasonality of the Company s business could be exacerbated by the adverse effects of unusual or severe weather conditions as well as by severe weather conditions caused by climate change on the Company s business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Due to the seasonality of the Company s business, the Company s business can be significantly adversely affected by unusual or severe weather conditions and by severe weather conditions caused by climate change.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Unfavorable weather conditions generally result in fewer golf rounds played, which generally results in reduced demand for all golf products, and in particular, golf balls.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Furthermore, catastrophic storms can negatively affect golf rounds played both during the storms and afterward, as storm damaged golf courses are repaired and golfers focus on repairing the damage to their homes, businesses and communities.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Consequently, sustained adverse weather conditions, especially during the warm weather months, could materially affect the Company s sales.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Changes in equipment standards under applicable Rules of Golf could adversely affect the Company s business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P18_S5	The Company seeks to have its new golf club and golf ball products satisfy the standards published by the USGA and The R A in the Rules of Golf because these standards are generally followed by golfers, both professional and amateur, within their respective jurisdictions.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P18_S6	The USGA publishes rules that are generally followed in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and The R A publishes rules that are generally followed in most other countries throughout the world.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P18_S7	However, the Rules of Golf as published by The R A and the USGA are virtually the same and are intended to be so pursuant to a Joint Statement of Principles issued in 2001.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In the future, existing USGA and/or R A standards may be altered in ways that adversely affect the sales of the Company s current or future products.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If a change in rules were adopted and caused one or more of the Company s current or future products to be nonconforming, the Company s sales of such products would be adversely affected.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	The Company s sales and business could be materially and adversely affected if professional golfers do not endorse or use the Company s products.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	The Company establishes relationships with professional golfers in order to evaluate and promote Callaway Golf, Odyssey, OGIO and TravisMathew branded products.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	The Company has entered into endorsement arrangements with members of the various professional tours, including the Champions Tour, the PGA Tour, the LPGA Tour, the PGA European Tour, the Japan Golf Tour and the Web.com Tour.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	While most professional golfers fulfill their contractual obligations, some have been known to stop using a sponsor s products despite contractual commitments.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If certain of the Company s professional endorsers were to stop using the Company s products contrary to their endorsement agreements, the Company s business could be adversely affected in a material way by the negative publicity or lack of endorsement.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The Company believes that professional usage of its golf clubs and golf balls contributes to retail sales.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The Company therefore spends a significant amount of money to secure professional usage of its products.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Many other companies, however, also aggressively seek the patronage of these professionals and offer many inducements, including significant cash incentives and specially designed products.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	There is a great deal of competition to secure the representation of tour professionals.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	As a result, it is expensive to attract and retain such tour professionals.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The inducements offered by other companies could result in a decrease in usage of the Company s products by professional golfers or limit the Company s ability to attract other tour professionals.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	A decline in the level of professional usage of the Company s products, or a significant increase in the cost to attract or retain endorsers, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s sales and business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Any significant changes in U.S. trade, tax or other policies that restrict imports or increase import tariffs could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	A significant amount of the Company s products are manufactured in Mexico, China and other regions outside of the United States.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The Trump administration has called for substantial changes to U.S. trade and tax policies, which may include import restrictions, increased import tariffs and/or changes in U.S. participation in multilateral trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
837465_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Restrictions on imports could prevent or make it difficult for the Company to obtain the components needed for new products which would affect the Company s sales.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Increased tariffs would require the Company to increase its prices which likely would decrease customer demand for its products.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Other countries might retaliate through the imposition of their own restrictions and or increased tariffs which would affect the Company s ability to export products and therefore adversely affect its sales.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Any significant changes in current U.S. trade, tax or other policies could have a material adverse effect upon the Company s results of operations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The Company has significant international operations and is exposed to risks associated with doing business globally.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The Company sells and distributes its products directly in many key international markets in Europe, Asia, North America and elsewhere around the world.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	These activities have resulted and will continue to result in investments in inventory, accounts receivable, employees, corporate infrastructure and facilities.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P27_S3	In addition, there are a limited number of suppliers of golf club components in the United States, and the Company has increasingly become more reliant on suppliers and vendors located outside of the United States.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P27_S4	The operation of foreign distribution in the Company s international markets, as well as the management of relationships with international suppliers and vendors, will continue to require the dedication of management and other Company resources.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The Company manufactures most of its products outside of the United States.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	As a result of this international business, the Company is exposed to increased risks inherent in conducting business outside of the United States.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In addition to foreign currency risks, these risks include:
837465_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Increased exposure to interruptions in air carrier or ship services.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Any significant adverse change in these and other circumstances or conditions relating to international operations could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Any difficulties from strategic acquisitions that the Company pursues or consummates, including its recent acquisitions of OGIO and TravisMathew, could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The Company may acquire companies, businesses and products that complement or augment its existing business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	For example, in 2017, the Company completed the acquisitions of OGIO and TravisMathew.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	The Company may not be able to integrate these businesses or any other business that it may acquire successfully or operate such acquired business profitably.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Integrating any newly acquired business could be expensive and time-consuming.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Integration efforts often take a significant amount of time, place a significant strain on managerial, operational and financial resources and could prove to be more difficult or expensive than predicted.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P31_S5	The diversion of management's attention and any delay or difficulties encountered in connection with any future acquisitions the Company may consummate could result in the disruption of on-going business or inconsistencies in standards and controls that could negatively affect the Company s ability to maintain third-party relationships.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Moreover, the Company may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing, or issue additional shares, to acquire any businesses or products, which may result in dilution for stockholders or the incurrence of indebtedness.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	As part of the Company s efforts to acquire companies, business or products or to enter into other significant transactions, the Company conducts business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in the transaction.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Despite the Company s efforts, the Company ultimately may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks and, as a result, might not realize the intended advantages of the transaction.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	If the Company fails to realize the expected benefits from previous acquisitions or other acquisitions it may consummate in the future, whether as a result of unidentified risks, integration difficulties, litigation with current or former employees and other events, the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	The Company has significant international sales and purchases, and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a significant negative impact on the Company s results of operations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	A significant portion of the Company s purchases and sales is international, and the Company conducts transactions in various currencies worldwide.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Conducting business in such currencies exposes the Company to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The Company s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, and as a result, transactions conducted in foreign currencies must be translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes based upon the applicable foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Fluctuations in these foreign currency exchange rates therefore may positively or negatively affect the Company s reported financial results and can significantly affect period-over-period comparisons.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The effect of the translation of foreign currencies on the Company s financial results can be significant.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The Company therefore engages in certain hedging activities to mitigate the annual impact of the translation of foreign currencies on the Company s financial results.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The Company s hedging activities can reduce, but will not eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	The extent to which the Company s hedging activities mitigate the effects of foreign currency translation varies based upon many factors, including the amount of transactions being hedged.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Other factors that could affect the effectiveness of the Company s hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts, volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Since the hedging activities are designed to reduce volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar but also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The Company s future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Foreign currency fluctuations can also affect the prices at which products are sold in the Company s international markets.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	The Company therefore adjusts its pricing based in part upon fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Significant unanticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates make it more difficult for the Company to manage pricing in its international markets.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P35_S4	If the Company is unable to adjust its pricing in a timely manner to counteract the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, the Company s pricing may not be competitive in the marketplace and the Company s financial results in its international markets could be adversely affected.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P35_S5	If the Company inaccurately forecasts demand for its products, it may manufacture either insufficient or excess quantities, which, in either case, could adversely affect its financial performance.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P35_S6	The Company plans its manufacturing capacity based upon the forecasted demand for its products.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P35_S7	Forecasting the demand for the Company's products is very difficult given the manufacturing lead time and the amount of specification involved.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The nature of the Company s business makes it difficult to adjust quickly its manufacturing capacity if actual demand for its products exceeds or is less than forecasted demand.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If actual demand for its products exceeds the forecasted demand, the Company may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of new products in time to fulfill actual demand, which could limit the Company s sales and adversely affect its financial performance.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	On the other hand, if actual demand is less than the forecasted demand for its products, the Company could produce excess quantities, resulting in excess inventories and related obsolescence charges that could adversely affect the Company s financial performance.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	The Company depends on single source or a limited number of suppliers for some of the components of its products, and the loss of any of these suppliers could harm its business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The Company is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for its clubheads and shafts, some of which are single sourced.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Furthermore, some of the Company s products require specially developed manufacturing techniques and processes which make it difficult to identify and utilize alternative suppliers quickly.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In addition, many of the Company s suppliers are not well capitalized and prolonged unfavorable economic conditions could increase the risk that they will go out of business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P37_S3	If current suppliers are unable to deliver clubheads, shafts or other components, or if the Company is required to transition to other suppliers, the Company could experience significant production delays or disruption to its business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P37_S4	The Company also depends on a single or a limited number of suppliers for the materials it uses to make its golf balls.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P37_S5	Many of these materials are customized for the Company.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P37_S6	Any delay or interruption in such supplies could have a material adverse impact on the Company s golf ball business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P37_S7	If the Company experiences any such delays or interruptions, the Company may not be able to find adequate alternative suppliers at a reasonable cost or without significant disruption to its business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P37_S8	A significant disruption in the operations of the Company s golf club assembly and golf ball manufacturing and assembly facilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company s sales, profitability and results of operations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	A significant disruption at any of the Company s golf club or golf ball manufacturing facilities or distribution centers in the United States or in regions outside the United States could materially and adversely affect the Company s sales, profitability and results of operations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	A disruption in the service or a significant increase in the cost of the Company s primary delivery and shipping services for its products and component parts or a significant disruption at shipping ports could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The Company uses United Parcel Service ( UPS ) for substantially all ground shipments of products to its U.S. customers.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The Company uses air carriers and ocean shipping services for most of its international shipments of products.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Furthermore, many of the components the Company uses to build its golf clubs, including clubheads and shafts, are shipped to the Company via air carrier and ship services.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P39_S3	If there is any significant interruption in service by such providers or at airports or shipping ports, the Company may be unable to engage alternative suppliers or to receive or ship goods through alternate sites in order to deliver its products or components in a timely and cost-efficient manner.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P39_S4	As a result, the Company could experience manufacturing delays, increased manufacturing and shipping costs and lost sales as a result of missed delivery deadlines and product demand cycles.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Any significant interruption in UPS services, air carrier services, ship services or at airports or shipping ports could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P39_S6	Furthermore, if the cost of delivery or shipping services were to increase significantly and the additional costs could not be covered by product pricing, the Company s operating results could be materially adversely affected.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The cost of raw materials and components could affect the Company s operating results.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The materials and components used by the Company and its suppliers involve raw materials, including synthetic rubber, thermoplastics, zinc stearate, zinc oxide and lime stone for the manufacturing of the Company s golf balls, and titanium alloys carbon fiber and steel for the assembly of the Company s golf clubs.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Significant price fluctuations or shortages in such raw materials or components, including the costs to transport such materials or components, the uncertainty of currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar, increases in labor rates, trade duties or tariffs, and/or the introduction of new and expensive raw materials, could materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The Company may be subject to product warranty claims that require the replacement or repair of products sold.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Such warranty claims could adversely affect the Company s results of operations and relationships with its customers.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The Company manufactures and/or distributes a variety of golf-related products and has a stated two-year warranty policy for its golf clubs.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	to sale, particularly in the case of new product introductions or upon design changes to existing products.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The failure to identify and correct manufacturing defects and product design issues prior to the sale of those products could result in product warranty claims that result in costs to replace or repair any such defective products.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Because many of the Company s products are sold to retailers for broad consumer distribution and/or to customers who buy in large quantities, there could be significant costs associated with such product warranty claims, including the potential for customer dissatisfaction that may adversely affect the Company s reputation and relationships with its customers, which may result in lost or reduced sales.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Failure to adequately enforce the Company s intellectual property rights could adversely affect its reputation and sales.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The golf club industry, in general, has been characterized by widespread imitation of popular club designs.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The Company has an active program of monitoring, investigating and enforcing its proprietary rights against companies and individuals who market or manufacture counterfeits and knockoff products.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The Company asserts its rights against infringers of its copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade dress.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P46_S2	However, these efforts may not be successful in reducing sales of golf products by these infringers.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Additionally, other golf club manufacturers may be able to produce successful golf clubs which imitate the Company s designs without infringing any of the Company s copyrights, patents, trademarks or trade dress.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P46_S4	The failure to prevent or limit such infringers or imitators could adversely affect the Company s reputation and sales.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P46_S5	The Company may become subject to intellectual property lawsuits that could cause it to incur significant costs or pay significant damages or that could prohibit it from selling its products.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P46_S6	The Company s competitors also seek to obtain patent, trademark, copyright or other protection of their proprietary rights and designs for golf clubs, golf balls and other golf products.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P46_S7	From time to time, third parties have claimed or may claim in the future that the Company s products infringe upon their proprietary rights.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P46_S8	The Company evaluates any such claims and, where appropriate, has obtained or sought to obtain licenses or other business arrangements.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P46_S9	To date, there have been no significant interruptions in the Company s business as a result of any claims of infringement.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P46_S10	However, in the future, intellectual property claims could force the Company to alter its existing products or withdraw them from the market or could delay the introduction of new products.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Various patents have been issued to the Company s competitors in the golf industry and these competitors may assert that the Company s golf products infringe their patent or other proprietary rights.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	If the Company s golf products are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights, the Company may be unable to obtain a license to use such technology, and it could incur substantial costs to redesign its products, withdraw them from the market, and/or to defend legal actions.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The Company s brands may be damaged by the actions of its licensees.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The Company licenses its trademarks to third-party licensees who produce, market and sell their products bearing the Company s trademarks.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	The Company chooses its licensees carefully and imposes upon such licensees various restrictions on the products, and on the manner, on which such trademarks may be used.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In addition, the Company requires its licensees to abide by certain standards of conduct and the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P49_S3	However, if a licensee fails to adhere to these requirements, the Company s brands could be damaged.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P49_S4	The Company s brands could also be damaged if a licensee becomes insolvent or by any negative publicity concerning a licensee or if the licensee does not maintain good relationships with its customers or consumers, many of which are also the Company s customers and consumers.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P49_S5	Sales of the Company s products by unauthorized retailers or distributors could adversely affect the Company s authorized distribution channels and harm the Company s reputation.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P49_S6	Some of the Company s products find their way to unauthorized outlets or distribution channels.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P49_S7	This gray market for the Company s products can undermine authorized retailers and foreign wholesale distributors who promote and support the Company s products, and can injure the Company s image in the minds of its customers and consumers.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P49_S8	On the other hand, stopping such commerce could result in a potential decrease in sales to those customers who are selling the Company s products to unauthorized distributors or an increase in sales returns over historical levels.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P49_S9	While the Company has taken some lawful steps to limit commerce of its products in the gray market in both the United States and abroad, it has not stopped such commerce.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P49_S10	The Company relies on research development, technical innovation and high quality products to successfully compete.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P49_S11	Technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process is essential to the Company s commercial success.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P49_S12	Research and development play a key role in the Company s technical innovation and competitive advantage.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P49_S13	The Company relies upon experts in various fields to develop and test cutting edge performance products.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	consumer demand for its products could decline, and if the Company experiences problems with the quality of its products, the Company may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems, any of which could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The Company relies on complex information systems for management of its manufacturing, distribution, sales and other functions.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	If the Company s information systems fail to perform these functions adequately or if the Company experiences an interruption in their operation, including a breach in cyber security, its business and results of operations could suffer.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	All of the Company s major operations, including manufacturing, distribution, sales and accounting, are dependent upon the Company s complex information systems.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	The Company s information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:
837465_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Hackers, computer viruses, software bugs or glitches.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Any damage or significant disruption in the operation of such systems or the failure of the Company s information systems to perform as expected would disrupt the Company s business, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess inventory and product shortages and otherwise adversely affect the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Cyber-attacks, unauthorized access to, or accidental disclosure of, consumer personally-identifiable information including credit card information, that the Company collects through its websites may result in significant expense and negatively impact the Company's reputation and business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	There is heightened concern and awareness over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	While the Company has implemented security measures, the Company s computer systems may nevertheless be susceptible to electronic or physical computer break-ins, viruses and other disruptions and security compromises.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Any perceived or actual unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of personally-identifiable information, whether through a compromise of the Company s network by an unauthorized party, employee theft, misuse or error or otherwise, could harm the Company s reputation, impair the Company s ability to attract website visitors, or subject the Company to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by consumers, and adversely affect the Company s operations, financial performance and condition.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Risks Related to Regulations Regulations related to conflict minerals require the Company to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing the Company s products.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The Commission's rules require disclosure related to sourcing of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	The rules require companies to, under specified circumstances, undertake due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P55_S2	The Company s products may contain some of the specified minerals.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P55_S3	As a result, the Company incurs additional expenses in connection with complying with the rules, including with respect to any due diligence that is required under the rules.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P55_S4	In addition, the Commission's implementation of the rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company s products.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P55_S5	There may only be a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free conflict minerals, and the Company cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain necessary conflict free minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P55_S6	Because the Company s supply chain is complex, the Company may also not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in the Company s products through the due diligence procedures that the Company implements, which may harm the Company s reputation.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The Company could be adversely affected by any violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ), the U.K. Bribery Act, and other foreign anti-bribery laws.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	The FCPA generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Other countries in which the Company operates also have anti-bribery laws, some of which prohibit improper payments to government and non-government persons and entities, and others (e.g., the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act) extend their application to activities outside of their country of origin.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P56_S3	The Company s policies mandate compliance with all applicable anti-bribery laws.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P56_S4	In certain regions of the world, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P56_S5	In addition, the Company may conduct business in certain regions through intermediaries over whom the Company has less direct control, such as subcontractors, agents, and partners (such as joint venture partners).
837465_18_ITEM1A_P56_S6	Although the Company has implemented policies, procedures, and, in certain cases, contractual arrangements designed to facilitate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, the Company s officers, directors, associates, subcontractors, agents, and partners may take actions in violation of the Company s policies, procedures, contractual arrangements, and anti-bribery laws.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P56_S7	Any such violation, even if prohibited by the Company s policies, could subject the Company and such persons to criminal and/or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, cash flows, and reputation.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P56_S8	The Company is subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which could subject the Company to liabilities, increase its costs or restrict its operations in the future.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The Company s properties and operations are subject to a number of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, water discharges, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P57_S2	The Company s failure to comply with such environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could result in substantial civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring remedial or corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or other actions.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P57_S3	The Company may also be subject to liability for environmental investigations and cleanups, including at properties that the Company currently or previously owned or operated, even if such contamination was not caused by the Company, and the Company may face claims alleging harm to health or property or natural resource damages arising out of contamination or exposure to hazardous substances.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P57_S4	The Company may also be subject to similar liabilities and claims in connection with locations at which hazardous substances or wastes the Company has generated have been stored, treated, otherwise managed, or disposed.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P57_S5	Environmental conditions at or related to the Company s current or former properties or operations, and/or the costs of complying with current or future environmental, health and safety requirements (which have become more stringent and complex over time) could materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P57_S6	Changes in, or any failure to comply with, privacy laws, regulations, and standards may adversely affect the Company s business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Personal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the United States, Europe, and in many other jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Furthermore, federal, state, or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws and regulations affecting data privacy, all of which may be subject to invalidation by relevant foreign judicial bodies.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Industry organizations also regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in this area.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P58_S4	In the United States, these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of federal agencies and state attorneys general and legislatures and consumer protection agencies.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P58_S5	Internationally, many jurisdictions in which the Company operates have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which the Company or its customers must comply, including but not limited to, the Data Protection Directive established in the European Union (the "EU") and data protection legislation of the individual member states subject to such directive.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P58_S6	The Data Protection Directive will be replaced in 2018 with the pending European General Data Protection Regulation, which will impose additional obligations, penalties and risk upon the Company s business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are also rising.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	In addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to the Company.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws, regulations, and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to the Company, damage its reputation and adversely affect its business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Other Risks Significant developments stemming from the U.K. s decision to withdraw from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The United Kingdom has voted in favor of leaving the EU, and such withdrawal (commonly referred to as Brexit ) is scheduled to take effect over the next two years.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P63_S1	This decision has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the United Kingdom and the EU, and this uncertainty may last for several years.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P63_S2	The Company's business in the United Kingdom, the EU, and worldwide could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact of Brexit.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P63_S3	The pending withdrawal and its possible future consequences have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets, including in global currency and debt markets.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P63_S4	This volatility could cause a slowdown in economic activity in the United Kingdom, Europe or globally, which could adversely affect the Company's operating results and growth prospects, or result in a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar which would also adversely affect the Company's reported operating results.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P63_S5	Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the Company's effective income tax rate and profitability.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Although the Tax Act enacted in December 2017 lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate, the Company's effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-US earnings for which the Company has not previously provided for U.S. taxes.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P64_S2	The Company regularly assesses all of these matters to determine the adequacy of its tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The Tax Act is unclear in certain respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS), any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	In addition, it is unclear how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	While some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect the Company in one or more reporting periods and prospectively, other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P66_S1	The Company is still evaluating certain provisions included in the Tax Act and therefore not completed its full assessment.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P66_S2	As such, there may be material adverse effects resulting from the Tax Act that the Company has not yet identified.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The Company s ability to utilize all or a portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets may be limited significantly if the Company experiences an ownership change.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P67_S1	The Company has a significant amount of U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards, other losses and credit carryforwards.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P67_S2	The Company s ability to utilize the losses and credits to offset future taxable income may be limited significantly if the Company were to experience an ownership change as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
837465_18_ITEM1A_P67_S3	In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in ownership of the Company s stock by 5-percent shareholders (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P67_S4	The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred for purposes of Section 382 is complex and requires significant judgment.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P67_S5	The extent to which the Company s ability to utilize the losses and credits is limited as a result of such an ownership change depends on many variables, including the value of the Company s stock at the time of the ownership change.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P67_S6	The Company continues to monitor changes in ownership.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P67_S7	If such a cumulative increase did occur in any three-year period and the Company were limited in the amount of losses and credits it could use to offset taxable income, the Company s results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P67_S8	The Company s obligations and certain financial covenants contained under its existing credit facilities expose it to risks that could materially and adversely affect its liquidity, business, operating results, financial condition and limit the Company s flexibility in operating its business, including the ability to make any dividend or other payments on its capital stock.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	The Company s primary credit facility is a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (as amended, the ABL Facility ), comprised of a U.S. facility, a Canadian facility and a United Kingdom facility, in each case subject to borrowing base availability under the applicable facility.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P68_S1	The amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are secured by certain assets, including cash (to the extent pledged by the Company), the Company's intellectual property, certain eligible real estate, inventory and accounts receivable of the Company s subsidiaries in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	the ABL Facility fluctuates with the general seasonality of the business, and increases and decreases with the changes in the Company's inventory and account receivable balances.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P69_S1	The ABL Facility includes certain restrictions including, among other things, restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, liens, dividends, stock repurchases and other restricted payments, asset sales, investments, mergers, acquisitions and affiliate transactions.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P69_S2	In addition, the ABL Facility imposes restrictions on the amount the Company could pay in annual cash dividends, including meeting certain restrictions on the amount of additional indebtedness and requirements to maintain a certain fixed charge coverage ratio under certain circumstances.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P69_S3	If the Company experiences a decline in revenues or adjusted EBITDA, the Company may have difficulty paying interest and principal amounts due on its ABL Facility or other indebtedness and meeting certain of the financial covenants contained in the ABL Facility.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P69_S4	If the Company is unable to make required payments under the ABL Facility, or if the Company fails to comply with the various covenants and other requirements of the ABL Facility or other indebtedness, the Company would be in default thereunder, which would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate the maturity thereof.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P69_S5	Any default under the ABL Facility or other indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on the Company s liquidity, business, operating results and financial condition and ability to make any dividend or other payments on the Company s capital stock.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P69_S6	See Note 4 Financing Arrangements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the terms of the ABL Facility and the Company's Japan ABL Facility.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The Company s ability to generate sufficient positive cash flows from operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including future economic trends and conditions, demand for the Company s products, foreign currency exchange rates and other risks and uncertainties applicable to the Company and its business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P70_S1	No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to generate sufficient operating cash flows in the future or maintain or grow its existing cash balances.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P70_S2	If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows to fund its business due to a further decline in sales or otherwise and is unable to reduce its manufacturing costs and operating expenses to offset such decline, the Company will need to increase its reliance on its credit facilities for needed liquidity.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P70_S3	If its credit facilities are not then available or sufficient and the Company is not able to secure alternative financing arrangements, the Company s future operations would be materially, adversely affected.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The Company may need to raise additional funds from time to time through public or private debt or equity financings in order to execute its growth strategy.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P71_S1	The Company may need to raise additional funds from time to time in order to take advantage of opportunities, including the expansion of its business or the acquisition of complementary products, technologies or businesses; develop new products; or respond to competitive pressures.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or securities convertible into equity will dilute the percentage ownership of holders of the Company s common stock.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P71_S3	Capital raised through debt financing would require the Company to make periodic interest payments and may impose restrictive covenants on the conduct of its business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P71_S4	Furthermore, additional financings may not be available on terms economically favorable to the Company, or at all, especially during periods of adverse economic conditions, which could make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to obtain funding for the operation of its business, for making additional investments in product development and for repaying outstanding indebtedness.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P71_S5	A failure to obtain any necessary additional funding could prevent the Company from making expenditures that may be required to grow its business or maintain its operations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P71_S6	The Company s current senior management team and other key executives are critical to the Company s success, and the loss of, and failure to adequately replace, any such individual could significantly harm the Company s business.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The Company s ability to maintain its competitive position is dependent to a large degree on the efforts and skills of the senior officers of the Company.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P72_S1	The Company s executives are experienced and highly qualified with strong reputations in the golf industry, and the Company believes that its management team enables it to pursue the Company s strategic goals.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P72_S2	The success of the Company s business is dependent upon the management and leadership skills of its senior management team and other key personnel.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Competition for these individuals talents is intense, and the Company may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P72_S4	The loss of one or more of these senior officers could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its ability to achieve its strategic goals.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P72_S5	The Company s insurance policies may not provide adequate levels of coverage against all claims and the Company may incur losses that are not covered by its insurance.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	The Company maintains insurance of the type and in amounts that the Company believes is commercially reasonable and that is available to businesses in its industry.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P73_S1	The Company carries various types of insurance, including general liability, auto liability, workers compensation and excess umbrella, from highly rated insurance carriers.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	control could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that the Company can obtain in the future or restrict its ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P74_S1	The Company cannot predict the level of the premiums that the Company may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage, the level of any deductible and/or self insurance retention applicable thereto, the level of aggregate coverage available or the availability of coverage for specific risks.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P74_S2	In the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage that the Company carries may not be sufficient to compensate the Company for the losses the Company incurs or any costs the Company is responsible for.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P74_S3	Goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of the Company s total assets, and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact the Company's results of operations and shareholders equity.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P74_S4	The Company s goodwill and intangible assets consist of goodwill from acquisitions, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, patents and other intangible assets.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P74_S5	Accounting rules require the evaluation of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P74_S6	Such indicators include a sustained decline in the Company s stock price or market capitalization, adverse changes in economic or market conditions or prospects, and changes in the Company s operations.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	An asset is considered to be impaired when its carrying value exceeds its fair value.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	The Company determines the fair value of an asset based upon the discounted cash flows expected to be realized from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P76_S1	If in conducting an impairment evaluation the Company determines that the carrying value of an asset exceeded its fair value, the Company would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P76_S2	If a significant amount of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets were deemed to be impaired, the Company s results of operations and shareholders equity would be significantly adversely affected.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P76_S3	If the Company s estimates or judgments relating to its critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, its financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P77_S1	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, as discussed below in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in Item 7.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P77_S2	The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing the Company s consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition; allowance for doubtful accounts; inventories; long-lived assets, goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets; warranty policy; income taxes and provisional estimates due to the Tax Act enacted in December 2017; share-based compensation; and foreign currency translation.
837465_18_ITEM1A_P77_S4	The Company s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if its assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in its assumptions, which could cause its results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of its common stock.

837465_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to liquidity, capital availability and quarterly determinations that cash dividends are in the best interests of its shareholders.
837465_18_ITEM5_P0_S1	Future dividends may be affected by, among other items, the Company s views on potential future capital requirements, projected cash flows and needs, changes to the Company s business model, and certain restrictions limiting dividends imposed by the ABL Facility (see Note 4 Financing Arrangements , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	Performance Graph The following graph presents a comparison of the cumulative total shareholder return of the Company s common stock since December 31, 2012 to two indices: the Standard Poor s 500 Index ( S P 500 ) and the Standard Poor s 600 Smallcap Index ( S P 600 ).
837465_18_ITEM5_P1_S1	The S P 500 tracks the aggregate price performance of equity securities of 500 large-cap companies that are actively traded in the United States, and is considered to be a leading indicator of U.S. equity securities.
837465_18_ITEM5_P1_S2	The S P 600 is a market value-weighted index that tracks the aggregate price performance of equity securities from a broad range of small-cap stocks traded in the United States.
837465_18_ITEM5_P1_S3	The graph assumes an initial investment of $100 at December 31, 2012 and reinvestment of all dividends in ELY stock on the dividend payable date.
837465_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	The Callaway Golf Company cumulative total shareholder return is based upon the closing prices of Callaway Golf Company common stock on December 31, 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , 2015 , 2016 and 2017 of $6.50, $8.43, $7.70, $9.42, $10.96 and $13.93, respectively.
837465_18_ITEM5_P2_S1	In August 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a $50.0 million share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase shares of its common stock in the open market or in private transactions, subject to the Company s assessment of market conditions and buying opportunities.
837465_18_ITEM5_P2_S2	The repurchases are made consistent with the terms of the Company's primary credit facility which limits the amount of stock that can be repurchased.
837465_18_ITEM5_P2_S3	The repurchase program will remain in effect until completed or until terminated by the Board of Directors.
837465_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	The table below summarizes the Company's share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2017 .
837465_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	During 2017 , the Company repurchased approximately 1,536,000 shares of its common stock under the 2014 repurchase program at an average cost per share of $10.82 for a total cost of $16.6 million .
837465_18_ITEM5_P4_S1	Included in these amounts are $6.6 million of shares the Company withheld to satisfy the Company's tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting and settlement of employee restricted stock unit awards.
837465_18_ITEM5_P4_S2	The Company s repurchases of shares of common stock are recorded at cost and result in a reduction of shareholders equity.
837465_18_ITEM5_P4_S3	As of December 31, 2017 , the total amount remaining under the repurchase authorization was $25.3 million.
837465_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	(1) In 2017, the Company completed the acquisitions of OGIO and TravisMathew.
837465_18_ITEM6_P0_S1	The Company's consolidated statement of operations includes the recognition of $3.1 million and $2.4 million in one-time transaction costs for OGIO and TravisMathew, respectively.
837465_18_ITEM6_P0_S2	The Company's consolidated balance sheet includes the addition of $66.0 million and $124.6 million in total net assets related to OGIO and TravisMathew, respectively.
837465_18_ITEM6_P1_S0	(2) On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into legislation, which includes a broad range of provisions affecting businesses.
837465_18_ITEM6_P1_S1	The Tax Act significantly revises how companies compute their U.S corporate tax liability by, among other provisions, reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.
837465_18_ITEM6_P2_S0	Pursuant to the Tax Act, the Company recorded net tax expense of $7.5 million, which was comprised of $11.1 million of income tax expense related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets, partially offset by a tax benefit of $3.6 million as a result of the mandatory deemed repatriation on earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign subsidiaries.
837465_18_ITEM6_P2_S1	The Company's tax provision, total assets and long-term liabilities were significantly impacted in 2016 by the reversal of the Company's valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_18_ITEM6_P2_S2	In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company performed an analysis to determine the realization of its deferred tax assets and concluded that it was more likely than not that the majority of its U.S. deferred tax assets will be realized, which resulted in a one-time, non-cash benefit of $156.6 million related to the reversal of the Company's valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_18_ITEM6_P2_S3	This reversal was partially offset by the recognition of $16.0 million in income taxes that were retroactive for all of 2016 on the Company's U.S. business.
837465_18_ITEM6_P2_S4	For further discussion see Note 10 " Income Taxes " in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. (4) In July 2016, the Company contributed $10.6 million , primarily in cash, for a 52% ownership of the new joint venture, Callaway Apparel K.K. (see Note 8 " Joint Venture " in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_18_ITEM6_P2_S5	The Company is required to consolidate the financial results of the joint venture and, as a result, the Company recorded net income attributable to the non-controlling interest of $0.9 million and $1.1 million in its consolidated statement of operations during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
837465_18_ITEM6_P2_S6	The Company recognized a non-controlling interest of $9.7 million at both December 31, 2017 and 2016 in its consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of shareholders' equity.
837465_18_ITEM6_P2_S7	In April 2016, the Company sold approximately 10.0% or $5.8 million (on a cost basis) of its preferred shares in Topgolf for $23.4 million , and recognized a gain of approximately $17.7 million in other income (expense) during the second quarter of 2016.
837465_18_ITEM6_P3_S0	See Note 7 " Investments " in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. (6) In August 2012, the Company issued $112.5 million of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes (the convertible notes ) in exchange for cash and 0.6 million shares of the Company s then-outstanding 7.50% Series B Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock in separate, privately negotiated exchange transactions.
837465_18_ITEM6_P3_S1	During the second half of 2015, the convertible notes were eliminated pursuant to certain exchange transactions and shareholder conversions, which resulted, among other things, in the issuance of approximately 15.0 million shares of common stock to the note holders (see Note 4 Financing Arrangements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_18_ITEM6_P3_S2	In connection with the elimination of the convertible notes and the issuance of the 15.0 million shares of common stock, the Company recorded $109.0 million in shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2015, net of the outstanding discount of $3.4 million.
837465_18_ITEM6_P3_S3	The Company recognized interest expense of $3.2 million , $5.0 million and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
837465_18_ITEM6_P3_S4	This update eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet, and instead classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent.
837465_18_ITEM6_P3_S5	The adoption of this update was made on a prospective basis as of December 31, 2015, therefore working capital and long-term liabilities in 2015 as well as 2016 are not comparable to prior periods presented.
837465_18_ITEM6_P4_S0	(8) The Company s operating statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 include pre-tax charges of $16.6 million in connection with the Company's cost-reduction initiatives that were announced in July 2012.
837465_18_ITEM6_P4_S1	As a result of these initiatives, in 2012, the Company recorded related decreases in working capital and total assets from the impairment of certain intangible assets including goodwill, as well as the write-off of certain long-lived assets and inventory.
837465_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	`Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations, financial condition and liquidity are based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP).
837465_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, shareholders equity, sales and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
837465_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
837465_18_ITEM7_P0_S3	Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
837465_18_ITEM7_P0_S4	On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business and new information as it becomes available.
837465_18_ITEM7_P0_S5	Management believes the critical accounting policies discussed below affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
837465_18_ITEM7_P0_S6	For a complete discussion of all of the Company s significant accounting policies, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition Through December 31, 2017, the Company accounted for revenue recognition in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.
837465_18_ITEM7_P0_S7	Beginning on January 1, 2018, the Company will account for revenue recognition under Topic 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," which will accelerate the timing of certain sales promotions and price concessions that the Company offers to its retailers to earlier in the product life cycle.
837465_18_ITEM7_P0_S8	For further discussion of Topic 606, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. In accordance with Topic 605, sales are recognized, in general, as products are shipped to customers, net of an allowance for sales returns and accruals for sales programs.
837465_18_ITEM7_P0_S9	In certain cases, the Company recognizes sales when products are received by customers.
837465_18_ITEM7_P0_S10	The Company records a reserve for anticipated returns through a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the period that the related sales are recorded.
837465_18_ITEM7_P0_S11	Sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through of products.
837465_18_ITEM7_P0_S12	In addition, from time to time, the Company offers sales programs that allow for specific returns.
837465_18_ITEM7_P0_S13	The Company records a reserve for anticipated returns related to these sales programs based on the terms of the sales program.
837465_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Historically, the Company s actual sales returns have not been materially different from management s original estimates.
837465_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance for sales returns.
837465_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	However, if the actual costs of sales returns are significantly different than the recorded estimated allowance, the Company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
837465_18_ITEM7_P1_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the recorded estimated allowance for 2017 sales returns, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have decreased by approximately $1.5 million .
837465_18_ITEM7_P1_S4	The Company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings.
837465_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program, management s forecast of future product demand, and historical customer participation in similar programs.
837465_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Company s primary sales program, the Preferred Retailer Program, offers longer payment terms during the initial sell-in period, as well as potential rebates and discounts, for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the Company, including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels, prime product placement and retailer staff training.
837465_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	Under this program, qualifying retailers can earn either discounts or rebates based upon the amount of product purchased.
837465_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	Discounts are applied and recorded at the time of sale.
837465_18_ITEM7_P3_S3	For rebates, the Company accrues an estimate of the rebate at the time of sale based on the customer s estimated qualifying current year product purchases.
837465_18_ITEM7_P3_S4	The estimate is based on the historical level of purchases, adjusted for any factors expected to affect the current year purchase levels.
837465_18_ITEM7_P3_S5	The estimated year-end rebate is adjusted quarterly based on actual purchase levels, as necessary.
837465_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Preferred Retailer Program is generally short term in nature and the actual costs of the program are known as of the end of the year and paid to customers shortly after year-end.
837465_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	In addition to the Preferred Retailer Program, the Company from time to time offers additional sales program incentive offerings which are also generally short term in nature.
837465_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Historically the Company s actual costs related to its Preferred Retailer Program and other sales programs have not been materially different than its estimates.
837465_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed.
837465_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	In addition, the Company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws.
837465_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	The Company s gift cards have no expiration date.
837465_18_ITEM7_P6_S3	To determine when redemption is remote, the Company analyzes an aging of unredeemed cards (based on the date the card was last used or the activation date if the card has never been used) and compares that information with historical redemption trends.
837465_18_ITEM7_P6_S4	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to determine the timing of recognition of gift card revenues.
837465_18_ITEM7_P6_S5	The deferred revenue associated with outstanding gift cards was $1.0 million and $1.3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
837465_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments.
837465_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	An estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, the customer s financial condition and current economic trends, all of which are subject to change.
837465_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	If the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance, the Company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected.
837465_18_ITEM7_P7_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase in uncollectible accounts over the 2017 recorded estimated allowance for doubtful accounts, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have decreased by approximately $0.4 million .
837465_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value.
837465_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
837465_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	The inventory balance, which includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs, is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory.
837465_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	The estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon current inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience as well as management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand, all of which are subject to change.
837465_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	The calculation of the Company s allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand and pricing, regulatory (USGA and R A) rule changes, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence.
837465_18_ITEM7_P10_S3	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance.
837465_18_ITEM7_P10_S4	However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner, the Company may need to increase its inventory allowance, which could significantly adversely affect the Company s operating results.
837465_18_ITEM7_P10_S5	Assuming there had been a 10% increase in obsolete or unmarketable inventory over the 2017 recorded estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have decreased by approximately $1.4 million .
837465_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company acquires tangible and intangible assets.
837465_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and amortizing intangible assets, and investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable or exceeds its fair value.
837465_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	The Company evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually or more frequently whenever indicators are present that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.
837465_18_ITEM7_P11_S3	Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining the amount of undiscounted cash flows directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, the timing of the impairment test, and the asset s residual value, if any.
837465_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	To determine fair value, the Company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate.
837465_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the asset and a charge to earnings.
837465_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	The Company uses its best judgment based on current facts and circumstances related to its business when making these estimates.
837465_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	However, if actual results are not consistent with the Company s estimates and assumptions used in calculating future cash flows and asset fair values, the Company may be exposed to losses that could be material.
837465_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	estimated fair values of the Company s reporting units, as well as the estimated fair values of certain trade names and trademarks, significantly exceeded their carrying values.
837465_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	As a result, no impairment was recorded as of December 31, 2017 .
837465_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Warranty Policy The Company has a stated two-year warranty policy for its golf clubs.
837465_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	The Company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded.
837465_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	In estimating its future warranty obligations, the Company considers various relevant factors, including the Company s stated warranty policies and practices, the historical frequency of claims, and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty.
837465_18_ITEM7_P14_S3	The Company s estimates for calculating the warranty reserve are principally based on assumptions regarding the warranty costs of each club product line over the expected warranty period.
837465_18_ITEM7_P14_S4	Where little or no claims experience may exist, the Company s warranty obligation calculation is based upon long-term historical warranty rates of similar products until sufficient data is available.
837465_18_ITEM7_P14_S5	As actual model-specific rates become available, the Company s estimates are modified to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes.
837465_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Historically, the Company s actual warranty claims have not been materially different from management s original estimated warranty obligation.
837465_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the warranty obligation.
837465_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	However, if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims were to significantly exceed the estimated warranty reserve, the Company may be exposed to losses that could be material.
837465_18_ITEM7_P15_S3	Assuming there had been a 10% increase in warranty claims over the 2017 recorded estimated allowance for warranty obligations, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have decreased by approximately $0.7 million .
837465_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Income Taxes Current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year.
837465_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to ASC Topic 740, "Income Taxes," and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
837465_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	The Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
837465_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire.
837465_18_ITEM7_P17_S3	These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment.
837465_18_ITEM7_P17_S4	These estimates are based on the Company s best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions.
837465_18_ITEM7_P17_S5	In 2011, as a result of this evaluation, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_18_ITEM7_P17_S6	During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company reversed a significant portion of the valuation allowance on those deferred tax assets.
837465_18_ITEM7_P17_S7	For further discussion see Note 10 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Pursuant to ASC Topic 740-25-6, the Company is required to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is deemed to be more likely than not that the Company would be required to pay such additional taxes.
837465_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	The Company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions.
837465_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	The preparation of these income tax returns requires the Company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by the Company.
837465_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	The Company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability, including interest and penalties in income tax expense, for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return.
837465_18_ITEM7_P18_S3	The Company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available.
837465_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Historically, additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the Company s uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the Company s expectations.
837465_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
837465_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ).
837465_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	Shortly after the Tax Act was enacted, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("SAB 118"), which provides guidance on accounting for the Tax Act s impact.
837465_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	SAB 118 provides a measurement period, which should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date, during which a company acting in good faith may complete the accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act under ASC Topic 740.
837465_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	with SAB 118, the Company must reflect the income tax effects of the Tax Act in the reporting period in which the accounting under ASC Topic 740 is complete.
837465_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	To the extent that the Company s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete, the Company can determine a reasonable estimate for those effects and record a provisional estimate in the consolidated financial statements in the first reporting period in which a reasonable estimate can be determined.
837465_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	If the Company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the consolidated financial statements, the Company should continue to apply ASC Topic 740 based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the Tax Act being enacted.
837465_18_ITEM7_P21_S3	If the Company is unable to provide a reasonable estimate of the impacts of the Tax Act in a reporting period, a provisional amount must be recorded in the first reporting period in which a reasonable estimate can be determined.
837465_18_ITEM7_P21_S4	For further information, see Note 10 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Share-based Compensation The Company grants stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance share units and other equity-based awards to the Company s officers, employees, consultants and certain other non-employees who provide services to the Company.
837465_18_ITEM7_P21_S5	The Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and non-employees based on estimated fair values.
837465_18_ITEM7_P21_S6	ASC Topic 718 further requires a reduction in share-based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	The forfeiture rate used by the Company is based on historical forfeiture trends.
837465_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	If actual forfeitures are not consistent with the Company s estimates, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods.
837465_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Performance share units are stock-based awards in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on the Company's performance against specified goals that are measured over a designated performance period from the date of grant.
837465_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	These performance goals are established by the Company at the beginning of the performance period.
837465_18_ITEM7_P23_S2	At the end of the performance period, the number of shares of stock that could be issued is fixed based upon the degree of achievement of the performance goals.
837465_18_ITEM7_P23_S3	The number of shares that could be issued can range from 0% to 200% of the participant's target award.
837465_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Performance share units are initially valued at the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant.
837465_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	Compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the vesting period and will vary based on the anticipated performance level during the performance period.
837465_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	If the performance goals are not probable of achievement during the performance period, compensation expense would be reversed.
837465_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	The awards are canceled if the performance goals are not achieved as of the end of the performance period.
837465_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	The performance units vest in full at the end of a three-year period.
837465_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options and stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) at the date of grant.
837465_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the Company s expected stock price volatility, the expected dividend yield, the expected term of an option or SAR and the risk-free interest rate, which is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
837465_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected price volatility and the expected term.
837465_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	The Company uses forecasted dividends to estimate the expected dividend yield.
837465_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option or SAR.
837465_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option or SAR does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee.
837465_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for stock options.
837465_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	Compensation expense for SARs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an award s estimated fair value, which is remeasured at the end of each reporting period.
837465_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	Once vested, SARs continued to be remeasured to fair value until they are exercised.
837465_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company records compensation expense for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (collectively restricted stock ) based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
837465_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	The estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares underlying the award.
837465_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, reduced by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Phantom stock units are a form of share-based awards that are indexed to the Company s stock and are settled in cash.
837465_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	Compensation expense for phantom stock units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the award s estimated fair value.
837465_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	Fair value is remeasured at the end of each interim reporting period through the award s settlement date and is based on the closing price of the Company s stock.
837465_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Foreign Currency Translation A significant portion of the Company s business is conducted outside of the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
837465_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	As a result, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on the Company s financial results.
837465_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Revenues and expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the average exchange rate for the period.
837465_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date.
837465_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	Gains and losses from assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity on which they reside are generally recognized currently in the Company's statements of operations.
837465_18_ITEM7_P32_S3	Gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.
837465_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	As part of the Company's overall strategy to manage its level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts.
837465_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	While these foreign currency forward contracts can mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, they do not eliminate those effects, which can be significant.
837465_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	For all contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges, the Company records gains and losses in other comprehensive income or loss.
837465_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	These gains and losses are released from other comprehensive income or loss and recognized in net sales or cost of goods sold in the period in which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized.
837465_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	Gains and losses on derivatives that are not elected for hedge accounting treatment or that do not meet hedge accounting requirements are recorded immediately in other income (expense).
837465_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by this reference.
837465_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Discussion of Non-GAAP Measures In addition to the financial results contained in this report, which have been prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company has also included supplemental information concerning the Company s financial results on a non-GAAP basis.
837465_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	This non-GAAP information includes certain of the Company's financial results without transaction costs and transition costs associated with the OGIO and TravisMathew acquisitions as well as the impact of the new tax legislation for the year ended December 31, 2017, and excludes the effects of the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance and the gain on the sale of a portion of the Company's Topgolf investment for the year ended December 31, 2016.
837465_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	In addition, non-GAAP information includes certain of the Company s financial results on a constant currency basis for the comparative years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
837465_18_ITEM7_P36_S3	This constant currency information estimates what the Company s financial results would have been without changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
837465_18_ITEM7_P36_S4	This information is calculated by taking the local currency results for 2016 and translating them into U.S. dollars based upon the foreign currency exchange rates for the applicable comparable prior period.
837465_18_ITEM7_P36_S5	It does not include any other effect of changes in foreign currency rates on the Company s results or business.
837465_18_ITEM7_P36_S6	The Company has included in this report information to reconcile this non-GAAP information to the most directly comparable GAAP information.
837465_18_ITEM7_P36_S7	The non-GAAP information presented in this report should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with GAAP.
837465_18_ITEM7_P36_S8	The non-GAAP information may also be inconsistent with the manner in which similar measures are derived or used by other companies.
837465_18_ITEM7_P36_S9	Management uses such non-GAAP information for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period over period comparisons of the underlying performance of its business and in forecasting the Company s business going forward.
837465_18_ITEM7_P36_S10	Management believes that the presentation of such non-GAAP information, when considered in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP information, provides additional useful comparative information for investors in their assessment of the underlying performance of the Company s business.
837465_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	Results of Operations Overview of Business, Seasonality and Foreign Currency Products The Company designs, manufactures and sells high quality golf clubs, golf balls, golf bags and other golf-related accessories.
837465_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	The Company designs its products to be technologically advanced and in this regard invests a considerable amount in research and development each year.
837465_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	The Company designs golf products for golfers of all skill levels, both amateur and professional.
837465_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	The primary reason for these acquisitions was to enhance the Company's presence in golf while also providing a platform for future growth in the lifestyle category.
837465_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Operating Segments As a result of the Company's apparel joint venture in Japan established in July 2016, as well as the Company's acquisition of OGIO in January 2017, the Company reassessed its operating segments during the first quarter of 2017.
837465_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	With the addition of the apparel joint venture and OGIO acquisition, the Company anticipates generating significant growth within its accessories and other product category that was previously included within the Company's Golf Clubs segment.
837465_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	As a result, and based on the Company's assessment, as of January 1, 2017 the Company began including sales generated from golf apparel and footwear, golf bags, golf gloves, travel gear, headwear and other golf-related accessories, OGIO branded gear and accessories, retail apparel sales from the Company's joint venture in Japan, TravisMathew branded apparel, and royalties from licensing of the Company s trademarks and service marks for various soft goods products in the Gear, Accessories and Other operating segment.
837465_18_ITEM7_P41_S3	The Golf Clubs segment now consists of Callaway Golf woods, hybrids, irons and wedges, Odyssey putters, including Toulon Design putters by Odyssey, packaged sets and sales of pre-owned golf clubs.
837465_18_ITEM7_P41_S4	At the product category level, sales of packaged sets are included within irons, and sales of pre-owned golf clubs are included in the respective woods, irons and putters product categories.
837465_18_ITEM7_P41_S5	Prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect these changes.
837465_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Golf Balls segment continues to consist of Callaway Golf and Strata golf balls that are designed, manufactured and sold by the Company.
837465_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	As discussed in Note 17 Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, the Company s operating segments exclude a significant amount of corporate general administrative expenses and other income (expense) not utilized by management in determining segment profitability.
837465_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	Cost of Sales The Company s cost of sales is comprised primarily of material and component costs, distribution and warehousing costs, and overhead.
837465_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	As a result of the actions taken to improve manufacturing efficiencies, over 85% of the Company's manufacturing costs, primarily material and component costs, are variable in nature and fluctuate with sales volumes.
837465_18_ITEM7_P44_S2	With respect to the Company's operating segments, variable costs as a percentage of cost of sales range between 85% to 95% for Golf Clubs and 75% to 85% for Golf Balls.
837465_18_ITEM7_P44_S3	Variable costs for Gear, Accessories and Other are generally greater than 95% as fewer fixed costs are used in the manufacturing of the Company's soft goods products.
837465_18_ITEM7_P44_S4	Generally, the relative significance of the components of cost of sales does not vary materially from these percentages from period to period.
837465_18_ITEM7_P44_S5	See "Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 Segment Profitability" and "Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 Segment Profitability" below for further discussion of gross margins.
837465_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	In most of the regions where the Company conducts business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis.
837465_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	Weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year-round, except in a few markets, with many of the Company s on-course customers closing for the cold weather months.
837465_18_ITEM7_P45_S2	The Company s golf club and golf ball businesses are therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations.
837465_18_ITEM7_P45_S3	In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its golf club and golf ball products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season.
837465_18_ITEM7_P45_S4	This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter.
837465_18_ITEM7_P45_S5	The Company s second-quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter.
837465_18_ITEM7_P45_S6	The Company s third-quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but can also include smaller new product launches, typically resulting in lower sales than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season.
837465_18_ITEM7_P45_S7	The Company s fourth-quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company s key regions.
837465_18_ITEM7_P45_S8	However, third-quarter sales can be affected by a mid-year product launch, and fourth-quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year.
837465_18_ITEM7_P45_S9	This seasonality, and therefore quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as well as weather conditions.
837465_18_ITEM7_P45_S10	In general, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company s sales from its Golf Clubs and Golf Balls operating segments and most, if not all, of its profitability from these segments generally occurs during the first half of the year.
837465_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	Gear, Accessories and Other Sales of the Company's gear and accessories historically followed the golf clubs and golf balls seasonality, where most of the sales and profitability occurred during the first half of the year.
837465_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	generate higher sales in the third and fourth quarters during the winter apparel season in Japan, and during the holiday season in the United States when sales of OGIO branded products are higher.
837465_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	Sales of the recently acquired TravisMathew brand of apparel and accessories are expected to be higher during the first half of the year, when the golf season is at its peak.
837465_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	A significant portion of the Company s business is conducted outside of the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
837465_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	As a result, changes in foreign currency rates can have a significant effect on the Company s financial results.
837465_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates.
837465_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	While these foreign currency forward contracts can mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates, they do not eliminate those effects, which can be significant.
837465_18_ITEM7_P48_S4	These effects include (i) the translation of results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, (ii) the mark-to-market adjustments of certain intercompany balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies and (iii) the mark-to-market adjustments of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts.
837465_18_ITEM7_P48_S5	In general, the Company s overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts its business.
837465_18_ITEM7_P48_S6	In comparing the Company s results for 2017 to the prior year, the following factors affect the year-over-year comparisons:
837465_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	The Company s results for 2017 include transaction and transition expenses of $11.3 million related to the OGIO and TravisMathew acquisitions completed in January 2017 and August 2017, respectively.
837465_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	The Company s results for 2016 include a pre-tax gain of $17.7 million from the sale of approximately 10% of the Company's investment in Topgolf.
837465_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	There was no such sale or gain in 2017.
837465_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	The Company s results of operations for 2017 include the operating results from the OGIO and TravisMathew businesses, which are incremental to the results in the comparative periods of 2016.
837465_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	In addition, the Company s results of operations for 2017 include the incremental operating results from the apparel joint venture in Japan, which was established in July 2016.
837465_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	The Company s results of operations for 2016 only include the joint venture s operating results beginning in the third quarter.
837465_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company reversed a significant portion of the valuation allowance that was established on its U.S. deferred tax assets, and recognized a one-time income tax benefit of $156.6 million.
837465_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	As a result of this reversal, in 2017, the Company recognized a non-recurring, non-cash tax benefit of $4.1 million related to taxes on intercompany transactions.
837465_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act into legislation.
837465_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	As a result of the Tax Act, the Company recognized income tax expense of $7.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 (see further discussion below in the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016).
837465_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	Beginning in January 2017, the Company began reporting three operating segments (namely, Golf Clubs, Golf Balls and Gear, Accessories and Other) as opposed to the two operating segments reported in 2016 (namely, Golf Clubs and Golf Balls).
837465_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	For comparison purposes, the 2016 results have been reclassified to reflect the current year operating segment presentation.
837465_18_ITEM7_P54_S2	The Company s results for 2017 reflect its continued brand momentum and increased hard goods market share, as well as increased sales in all operating segments and in all major reporting geographic regions.
837465_18_ITEM7_P54_S3	Net sales for 2017 increased by $177.5 million or 20.4% to $1,048.7 million compared to 2016.
837465_18_ITEM7_P54_S4	This increase is attributable to the strength of the Company s 2017 product line, including the continued success of the current year Epic line of products, increased golf ball sales, including the new Chrome Soft X ball, and increased sales of gear and accessories as a result of the OGIO and TravisMathew acquisitions and the new apparel joint venture in Japan.
837465_18_ITEM7_P54_S5	The Company s gross margin improved 160 basis points to 45.8% in 2017 compared to 2016.
837465_18_ITEM7_P54_S6	This improvement was primarily due to a favorable shift in product mix toward the higher margin Epic line of woods and irons combined with an overall increase in average selling prices.
837465_18_ITEM7_P54_S7	Gross margin for 2017 also included the favorable impact of less discounting and lower promotional activity compared to 2016.
837465_18_ITEM7_P54_S8	This increase was partially offset by an increase in club component costs due to the higher cost materials and technology incorporated into current year products.
837465_18_ITEM7_P54_S9	Operating expenses increased $60.8 million or 17.8% to $401.6 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher variable expenses resulting from the increase in net sales period over period, the consolidation of the newly acquired OGIO and TravisMathew businesses in 2017 including $8.8 million of non-recurring transaction and transition expenses related to these acquisitions, and incremental operating expenses from the apparel joint venture in Japan.
837465_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	In 2016, the Company completed the sale of a small portion of its preferred shares of Topgolf for total proceeds of $23.4 million, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $17.7 million.
837465_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	The provision for income taxes increased by $158.9 million to $26.4 million in 2017 compared to 2016.
837465_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	This increase reflects the reversal of a significant portion of the valuation allowance on the Company's U.S. deferred tax assets of $156.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.
837465_18_ITEM7_P55_S3	The income tax provision for 2017 includes income tax expense of $7.5 million as a result of the newly enacted Tax Act.
837465_18_ITEM7_P55_S4	This was partially offset by a non-recurring, non-cash tax benefit of $4.1 million related to taxes on intercompany transactions resulting from the 2016 release of the valuation allowance against the Company s U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_18_ITEM7_P55_S5	Net income decreased $149.1 million or 78.5% to $40.8 million in 2017 compared to 2016, and diluted earnings per share decreased by $1.56 or 78.8% to $0.42.
837465_18_ITEM7_P55_S6	On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the acquisition costs and the impact of the Tax Act in 2017, and the Topgolf gain and the reversal of the valuation allowance in 2016, the Company's net income and diluted earnings per share for 2017 would have increased by $28.5 million to $51.3 million and by $0.29 to $0.53, respectively, compared to 2016.
837465_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $177.5 million ( 20.4% ) to $1,048.7 million compared to $871.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
837465_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	This improvement was driven by an increase in net sales in all three of the Company's operating segments.
837465_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	The increase in gear, accessories and other was largely due to the Company's newly acquired businesses, OGIO and TravisMathew, and the Company's apparel joint venture in Japan which contributed to incremental sales of bags, accessories and apparel in the golf and lifestyle categories .
837465_18_ITEM7_P56_S3	The increase in net sales in the Golf Clubs and Golf Balls operating segments was driven by the success of the Epic line of drivers and fairway woods and the Supersoft and Chrome Soft lines of golf balls, respectively.
837465_18_ITEM7_P56_S4	The Company s net sales by operating segment are presented below (dollars in millions):
837465_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	For further discussion of each operating segment s results, see "Operating Segment Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016" below.
837465_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Net sales information by region is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):
837465_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	Net sales in the United States increased $118.8 million ( 26.5% ) to $566.4 million during 2017 compared to $447.6 million in 2016 , primarily due to the continued success of the Company's new Epic line of drivers and fairway woods, combined with increased sales of bags, gear and apparel due to the Company's acquisition of Ogio and TravisMathew during the current year.
837465_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	quarter of 2016 combined with the continued success of the Company's Epic line of woods and irons.
837465_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	Foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $9.9 million on the Company's net sales denominated in foreign currencies.
837465_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	Gross profit increased $95.4 million to $480.4 million in 2017 from $385.0 million in 2016 .
837465_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	Gross profit as a percent of net sales ("gross margin") increased 160 basis points to 45.8% in 2017 from 44.2% in 2016 .
837465_18_ITEM7_P61_S3	The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a 410 basis point favorable shift in price and product mix in the woods product category due to the success of the current year Epic drivers, which have higher margins compared to the XR 16 drivers sold in the prior year, combined with a general increase in average selling prices across most product categories.
837465_18_ITEM7_P61_S4	This increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately 180 basis points primarily due to (i) an increase in club component costs due to the higher cost of materials and technology incorporated into current year products, (ii) higher freight costs resulting from more air shipments to meet the high demand of the Company's current year products, as well as (iii) the slightly dilutive impact of the Company's newly acquired OGIO and TravisMathew businesses, which in the aggregate had lower gross margins relative to the Company's core business.
837465_18_ITEM7_P61_S5	On a full year basis, the gross margin for the TravisMathew business would be expected to be accretive to the Company's overall gross margin.
837465_18_ITEM7_P61_S6	Foreign currency exchange rates also had an unfavorable impact of approximately 70 basis points on the Company's gross margins during the current year.
837465_18_ITEM7_P61_S7	For a further discussion of gross margin, see "Segment Profitability" below.
837465_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Selling expenses increased by $35.3 million to $270.9 million ( 25.8% of net sales) in 2017 compared to $235.6 million ( 27.0% of net sales) in 2016 .
837465_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	This increase was primarily due to an additional $18.5 million of incremental selling costs resulting from the formation and consolidation of the Company's apparel joint venture in Japan established during the third quarter of 2016, and the acquisitions of OGIO in January 2017 and TravisMathew in August 2017, as well as increases of $8.5 million in marketing and tour expenses, $6.9 million in employee costs due to increases in sales commissions, accrued employee incentive compensation and stock compensation expense, and $1.2 million in travel expenses.
837465_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	General and administrative expenses increased by $22.2 million to $94.2 million ( 9.0% of net sales) in 2017 compared to $72.0 million ( 8.3% of net sales) in 2016 .
837465_18_ITEM7_P62_S3	This increase was primarily due to $8.8 million of non-recurring transaction and transition costs incurred in connection with the acquisitions of OGIO and TravisMathew, $9.3 million of incremental general and administrative costs resulting from the consolidation of the Company's new businesses, a $5.7 million increase in employee costs due to increases in accrued employee incentive compensation expense and stock compensation expense, and $1.0 million in legal expenses.
837465_18_ITEM7_P62_S4	These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.8 million in bad debt expense.
837465_18_ITEM7_P62_S5	Research and development expenses increased by $3.3 million to $36.6 million ( 3.5% of net sales) in 2017 compared to $33.3 million ( 3.8% of net sales) in 2016 , primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in employee costs due to increases in accrued employee incentive compensation expense and stock compensation expense, combined with increases in research expenses and professional fees.
837465_18_ITEM7_P62_S6	Interest expense increased by $2.0 million to $4.4 million in 2017 compared to $2.4 million in 2016 primarily due to the refinancing of the Company's ABL Credit Facility during the fourth quarter of 2017 (see Note 4 " Financing Arrangements " to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_18_ITEM7_P62_S7	During 2016, the Company sold approximately 10.0% of its preferred shares in Topgolf for $23.4 million and recognized a $17.7 million gain in other income.
837465_18_ITEM7_P62_S8	See Note 7 Investments to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Other expense, net increased by $5.2 million to $6.9 million in 2017 compared to $1.7 million in 2016 primarily due to an increase in net foreign currency losses from non-designated foreign currency hedging contracts.
837465_18_ITEM7_P62_S9	The Company recorded an income tax provision of $26.4 million in 2017, compared to an income tax benefit of $132.6 million in 2016 .
837465_18_ITEM7_P62_S10	The income tax benefit for 2016 includes a non-cash benefit of $156.6 million related to the reversal of a signification portion of the Company's valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_18_ITEM7_P62_S11	This reversal was partially offset by the recognition of $16.0 million in income taxes that were retroactive for all of 2016 on the Company's earnings in the U.S.
837465_18_ITEM7_P62_S12	As of December 31, 2017, the Company recorded income tax expense of $7.5 million as a result of the Tax Act, which is comprised of $11.1 million of income tax expense as a result of the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new lower statutory tax rate of 21%, partially offset by a net tax benefit of $3.6 million as a result of the mandatory deemed repatriation on earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign subsidiaries, which generated foreign tax credits in excess of the tax expense recognized on the deemed repatriation.
837465_18_ITEM7_P62_S13	The Company has elected to record the mandatory repatriation and re-measurement of deferred taxes as a provisional amount for the year ended December 31, 2017, which the Company believes is a reasonable estimate in accordance with the Tax Act.
837465_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Company will adjust its estimates and further refine its tax calculations, if necessary, as changes to interpretations and further guidance around the newly enacted provisions are issued by the Internal Revenue Service.
837465_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	The Company is still evaluating various international provisions included in the Tax Act and has therefore not completed its assessment.
837465_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	These provisions will be effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018, and may materially impact the Company s effective tax rate in future years.

837465_18_ITEM7_P71_S3	This increase was primarily due to a $43.0 million increase in gross profit (or an increase of 240 basis points in gross margin) partially offset by a $14.4 million increase in operating expenses.
837465_18_ITEM7_P71_S4	The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a favorable shift in price and product mix within the woods product category, combined with an increase in average selling prices across all golf club product categories, which resulted in a positive impact to gross margin of approximately 500 basis points.
837465_18_ITEM7_P71_S5	The favorable shift in price and product mix in the woods product category was due to the success of the Epic line of premium drivers launched in 2017, which have higher margins compared to the XR 16 line of core drivers sold in 2016.
837465_18_ITEM7_P71_S6	This increase in margin was partially offset by an increase in cost of approximately 210 basis points due to an increase in club component costs due to the higher cost materials and technology incorporated into current year products and higher freight costs resulting from more air shipments to meet the high demand of the Company's current year products.
837465_18_ITEM7_P71_S7	The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases in marketing expenses, research and development and employee costs.

837465_18_ITEM7_P71_S11	This increase was primarily due to a $48.5 million increase in gross profit, offset by a $36.1 million increase in operating expenses, both due to the incremental sales and expenses from the acquisitions of OGIO in January 2017 and TravisMathew in August 2017, in addition to the Company's apparel joint venture in Japan established during the third quarter of 2016.
837465_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $27.4 million (3.2%) to $871.2 million compared to $843.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the Company's completion of its apparel joint venture in Japan during the second quarter of 2016, which has been consolidated with the Company's results since July 1, 2016, resulting in an increase in net sales of accessories and other products.
837465_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	In addition, despite softer than anticipated market conditions in 2016, the Company improved its market share due to the continued strength of its brand, resulting in increased sales in both the Company's Golf Clubs and Golf Balls operating segments.
837465_18_ITEM7_P72_S2	Overall, net sales were favorably impacted by an increase in average selling prices across all product categories, partially offset by a decline in sales volumes.
837465_18_ITEM7_P72_S3	Changes in foreign currency rates were favorable to the Company's net sales in 2016.
837465_18_ITEM7_P72_S4	Had the Company used 2015 foreign currency exchange rates to translate net sales for 2016, the Company's net sales for 2016 would have been lower by 0.9%.

837465_18_ITEM7_P76_S6	This increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase of 143 basis points resulting from improved operational efficiencies, combined with an increase of 84 basis points in price and product mix as a result of an increase in average selling prices within the golf balls, irons and woods categories, partially offset by an increase in promotional activity on some of the Company's irons products period over period and the unfavorable impact (47 basis points) of changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from inventory held in foreign regions.

837465_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	These increases were partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in stock compensation expense as a result of the payout of cash-settled stock awards period over period.
837465_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	Research and development expenses increased by $0.1 million to $33.3 million (3.8% of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $33.2 million (3.9% of net sales) in the comparable period of 2015.

837465_18_ITEM7_P78_S6	The income tax benefit for 2016 includes a one-time, non-cash benefit of $156.6 million related to the reversal of a signification portion of the Company's valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_18_ITEM7_P78_S7	This reversal was partially offset by the recognition of $16.0 million in income taxes that were retroactive for all of 2016 on the Company's U.S. business earnings.
837465_18_ITEM7_P78_S8	The Company used an effective U.S. income tax rate that is close to statutory rates to assess the income tax provision on its U.S. business.
837465_18_ITEM7_P78_S9	For further discussion, see Note 10 "Income Taxes" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased to $189.9 million compared to $14.6 million in the comparable period of 2015.

837465_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	As discussed above, during the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company reversed a significant portion of the valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets and recognized income taxes that were retroactive for all of 2016 on the Company's U.S. business earnings, which resulted in a net favorable impact to net income of $140.6 million ($1.47 per share).
837465_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	In addition, net income for 2016 includes a $17.7 million ($0.18 per share) pre-tax gain, as discussed above, from the sale preferred shares in Topgolf.
837465_18_ITEM7_P79_S2	Excluding the impact of the valuation allowance reversal, the recognition of additional income taxes and the gain recognized on the sale of a portion of the Company's investment in Topgolf, the Company's net income would have been $31.6 million, a 116.4% increase compared to 2015, and diluted earnings per share would have been $0.33, a 94.1% increase compared to 2015.

837465_18_ITEM7_P81_S2	The decline in sales volumes was primarily due to a shift in launch timing resulting in fewer woods products launched during 2016 compared to the prior year.
837465_18_ITEM7_P81_S3	The increase in average selling prices was primarily due to a price increase on the Company's XR 16 drivers and fairway woods launched in 2016, relative to the XR woods launched in the prior year.

837465_18_ITEM7_P81_S6	This increase was partially offset by an increase in promotional activity in 2016 related to reduced prices on the Company's XR irons which were in the second year of their product life cycle.
837465_18_ITEM7_P81_S7	The slight decline in sales volumes related to a decline in unit sales of wedges due to the full launch of the MD3 wedges in 2015 compared to the more limited launches of the X Series and MD Forged wedges in 2016.
837465_18_ITEM7_P81_S8	Net sales of putters decreased $0.3 million (0.3%) to $87.7 million for the year December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a 1.2% decline in sales volumes, partially offset by a 1.6% increase in average selling prices.
837465_18_ITEM7_P81_S9	The decline in sales volume was primarily due to the 2016 launch of the Company's White Hot RX putters, which was a smaller launch compared to the full line of Odyssey Works putters launched in the prior year.
837465_18_ITEM7_P81_S10	The increase in average selling prices was primarily due to the limited offerings of the Company's Toe Up and Stroke Lab putters, which had a higher average selling price than the Company's core putters offered in the prior year.

837465_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	This increase was primarily due to a $9.1 million increase in net sales (as discussed above) which contributed to a $7.6 million increase in gross profit (or a 240 basis point improvement in gross margin), partially offset by an increase of $2.6 million in operating expenses.
837465_18_ITEM7_P88_S2	The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to an increase in sales price and mix of 400 basis points due to the Chrome Soft golf balls launched in the current year at higher average selling prices compared to the Chrome Soft golf balls launched in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in cost of 230 basis points.
837465_18_ITEM7_P88_S3	Pre-tax income in the Company's Gear, Accessories and Other operating segment decreased to $18.2 million for 2016 from $19.1 million for 2015.
837465_18_ITEM7_P88_S4	This decrease was primarily due to the addition of the Company's apparel joint venture in Japan established during the third quarter of 2016, which resulted in a $6.9 million increase in operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in net sales of $17.3 million (as discussed above), which contributed to an increase in gross profit of $6.0 million.
837465_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	Financial Condition The Company s cash and cash equivalents decreased $40.3 million to $85.7 million at December 31, 2017 , from $126.0 million at December 31, 2016 .
837465_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	The decrease in cash was primarily driven by $181.8 million of net cash used to fund the Company's acquisitions of OGIO in January 2017 and TravisMathew in August 2017.
837465_18_ITEM7_P89_S2	Cash generated from operating activities improved to $117.7 million during 2017 compared to $77.7 million during 2016 primarily due a 16.5% increase in pre-tax earnings combined with an overall improvement in the Company's cash collection cycle as a result of improved payment terms period over period and the timing of inventory purchases and improved inventory management period over period.
837465_18_ITEM7_P89_S3	During 2017, the Company used its cash and cash equivalents, cash from its operating activities, and borrowings under its credit facilities to repurchase $16.6 million in shares of its common stock and pay tax withholding obligations with the vesting and settlement of employee equity awards, as well as to fund $26.2 million in capital expenditures, $21.5 million in investments in golf-related ventures, and the OGIO and TravisMathew acquisitions as discussed above.
837465_18_ITEM7_P89_S4	Management expects to fund the Company s future operations from current cash balances and cash provided by its operating activities combined with borrowings under its current and future credit facilities, as deemed necessary (see Note 4 " Financing Arrangements " in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on the ABL Facility).
837465_18_ITEM7_P89_S5	The Company s accounts receivable balance fluctuates throughout the year as a result of the general seasonality of the Company s business.
837465_18_ITEM7_P89_S6	The Company s accounts receivable balance will generally be at its highest during the first and second quarters due to the seasonal peak in the golf season, and it will generally decline significantly during the third and fourth quarters as a result of an increase in cash collections and lower sales.
837465_18_ITEM7_P89_S7	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company s net accounts receivable decreased to $94.7 million from $127.9 million as of December 31, 2016 .
837465_18_ITEM7_P89_S8	This $33.1 million decrease was primarily attributable to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, combined with a decrease in past-due accounts and an overall improvement in payment terms.
837465_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	The Company s inventory balance fluctuates throughout the year as a result of the general seasonality of the Company s business and is also affected by the timing of new product launches.
837465_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	Generally, the Company s buildup of inventory levels begins during the fourth quarter and continues heavily into the first quarter as well as into the beginning of the second quarter in order to meet demand during the height of the golf season.
837465_18_ITEM7_P90_S2	Inventory levels start to decline toward the end of the second quarter and are at their lowest during the third quarter.
837465_18_ITEM7_P90_S3	Inventory levels are also impacted by the timing of new product launches.
837465_18_ITEM7_P90_S4	The Company s inventories increased to $262.5 million as of December 31, 2017 from $189.4 million as of December 31, 2016 .
837465_18_ITEM7_P90_S5	This $73.1 million increase was primarily attributable to incremental inventory from the acquisitions of OGIO in January 2017 and TravisMathew in August 2017, combined with the timing and volume of inventory purchases related to products launched period over period.
837465_18_ITEM7_P90_S6	Inventories as a percentage of the trailing 12 months net sales increased to 25.0% as of December 31, 2017 compared to 21.7% as of December 31, 2016 .
837465_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources The information set forth in Note 4 Financing Arrangements , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, is incorporated herein by this reference.
837465_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	Liquidity The Company s principal sources of liquidity consist of its existing cash balances, funds expected to be generated from operations and its credit facilities.
837465_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	Based upon the Company s current cash balances, its estimates of funds expected to be generated from operations in 2018, and current and projected availability under its current or future credit facilities, the Company believes that it will be able to finance current and planned operating requirements, capital expenditures, contractual obligations and commercial commitments for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of this Form 10-K. The Company s ability to generate sufficient positive cash flows from operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including future economic trends and conditions, demand for the Company s products, foreign currency exchange rates, and other risks and uncertainties applicable to the Company and its business (see Risk Factors contained in Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K).
837465_18_ITEM7_P92_S2	If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows to fund its business due to a decline in sales or otherwise and is unable to reduce its manufacturing costs and operating expenses to offset such decline, the Company will need to increase its reliance on its credit facilities for needed liquidity.
837465_18_ITEM7_P92_S3	If the credit facilities are not then available or sufficient and the Company could not secure alternative financing arrangements, the Company s future operations would be materially adversely affected.
837465_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	In November 2017, the Company amended and restated its primary credit facility (the Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement) with Bank of America N.A. and other lenders (the ABL Facility ), which provides a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility of up to $330.0 million .
837465_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	The amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are secured by certain assets, including cash (to the extent pledged by the Company), the Company's intellectual property, certain eligible real estate, inventory and accounts receivable of the Company s subsidiaries in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.
837465_18_ITEM7_P93_S2	The real estate and intellectual property components of the borrowing base under the ABL Facility are both amortizing.
837465_18_ITEM7_P93_S3	The amount available for the real estate portion is reduced quarterly over a 15-year period, and the amount available for the intellectual property portion is reduced quarterly over a 3-year period.
837465_18_ITEM7_P93_S4	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company had $74.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility and $0.9 million in outstanding letters of credit.
837465_18_ITEM7_P93_S5	The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants of the ABL Facility as of December 31, 2017 .
837465_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	The ABL Facility also includes a senior secured term loan facility (the "Term Loan Facility") of $30.0 million , which is secured by a portion of the Company's intellectual property.
837465_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	The Term Loan Facility may be borrowed at any time until April 20, 2018 and will begin amortizing 15 months after the borrowing date.
837465_18_ITEM7_P94_S2	There were no amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Facility as of December 31, 2017 .
837465_18_ITEM7_P94_S3	In August 2017, the Company acquired TravisMathew for $124.6 million in an all-cash transaction, subject to customary working capital adjustments, and in January 2017 acquired OGIO for $66.0 million ( Note 3 Business Combinations , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).
837465_18_ITEM7_P94_S4	The Company funded these acquisitions with its existing cash balances combined with borrowings from the ABL Facility.
837465_18_ITEM7_P94_S5	As of December 31, 2017 , approximately 93% of the Company s total cash is held in regions outside of the United States.
837465_18_ITEM7_P94_S6	If the Company were to repatriate such cash, outside of settling intercompany balances during the normal course of operations, it may need to accrue and pay incremental withholding taxes.
837465_18_ITEM7_P94_S7	Due to changes enacted by the Tax Act, incremental U.S. federal income tax is no longer a consideration upon distribution.
837465_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	The Company has not, nor does it intend to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with its domestic debt service requirements.
837465_18_ITEM7_P95_S1	In 2015 and 2014, the Company ceased its business operations in Thailand and Malaysia, respectively, and accordingly, the Company no longer maintains a permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to these two entities.
837465_18_ITEM7_P95_S2	In April 2017, the Company completed the liquidation process for its subsidiary in Malaysia and repatriated the undistributed earnings of this entity to the United States.
837465_18_ITEM7_P95_S3	The amount repatriated was not material to the Company's consolidated condensed financial statements.
837465_18_ITEM7_P95_S4	The Company intends to repatriate the undistributed earnings from its Thailand entity to the United States at the time that the winding-down process has been completed.
837465_18_ITEM7_P95_S5	The Company expects no incremental U.S. income taxes related to reversing its permanent reinvestment assertion due to the mandatory repatriation clauses of the Tax Act.
837465_18_ITEM7_P95_S6	Except for the Company's foreign subsidiary in Thailand, the Company considers the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. withholding taxes have been provided thereon.
837465_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	In August 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a $50.0 million share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase shares of its common stock in the open market or in private transactions, subject to the Company s assessment of market conditions and buying opportunities.
837465_18_ITEM7_P96_S1	The repurchases are made consistent with the terms of the Company's ABL Facility which defines the amount of stock that can be repurchased.
837465_18_ITEM7_P96_S2	The repurchase program will remain in effect until completed or until terminated by the Board of Directors.
837465_18_ITEM7_P96_S3	During 2017, the Company repurchased approximately 1,536,000 shares of its common stock under the 2014 repurchase program at an average cost per share of $10.82 for a total cost of $16.6 million .
837465_18_ITEM7_P96_S4	Included in these amounts are $6.6 million of shares the Company withheld to satisfy the Company's tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting and settlement of employee restricted stock unit awards.
837465_18_ITEM7_P96_S5	The Company s repurchases of shares of common stock are recorded at cost and result in a reduction of shareholders equity.
837465_18_ITEM7_P96_S6	As of December 31, 2017, the total amount remaining under the repurchase authorization was $25.3 million.
837465_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	The following table summarizes certain significant cash obligations as of December 31, 2017 that will affect the Company s future liquidity (in millions):
837465_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	(1) Amounts represent future minimum lease payments.
837465_18_ITEM7_P98_S1	Capital lease obligations are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
837465_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	(2) The Company leases certain warehouse, distribution and office facilities, vehicles and office equipment under operating leases.
837465_18_ITEM7_P99_S1	The amounts presented in this line item represent commitments for minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases.
837465_18_ITEM7_P99_S2	(3) During the normal course of its business, the Company enters into agreements to purchase goods and services, including purchase commitments for production materials, endorsement agreements with professional golfers and other endorsers, employment and consulting agreements, and intellectual property licensing agreements pursuant to which the Company is required to pay royalty fees.
837465_18_ITEM7_P99_S3	the Company s sales levels, and reductions in payment obligations if designated minimum performance criteria are not achieved.
837465_18_ITEM7_P99_S4	The amounts listed approximate minimum purchase obligations, base compensation, and guaranteed minimum royalty payments the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements.
837465_18_ITEM7_P99_S5	The actual amounts paid under some of these agreements may be higher or lower than the amounts included.
837465_18_ITEM7_P99_S6	In the aggregate, the actual amount paid under these obligations is likely to be higher than the amounts listed as a result of the variable nature of these obligations.
837465_18_ITEM7_P99_S7	In addition, the Company also enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders or other documentation or that are undocumented except for an invoice.
837465_18_ITEM7_P99_S8	Such unconditional purchase obligations are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected in this line item.
837465_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	(4) Amount represents the current and non-current portions of uncertain income tax positions as recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 .
837465_18_ITEM7_P100_S1	Amount excludes uncertain income tax positions that the Company would be able to offset against deferred taxes.
837465_18_ITEM7_P100_S2	For further discussion, see Note 10 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. (5) Amount represents accrued employee incentive compensation expense earned in 2017, and paid in February 2018.
837465_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	In December 2017, the Company entered into a long-term financing agreement (the "Equipment Note") secured by certain equipment at the Company's golf ball manufacturing facility.
837465_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company had $11,815,000 outstanding under this agreement.
837465_18_ITEM7_P101_S2	For further discussion, see Note 4 " Financing Arrangements " in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. During its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions.
837465_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, and (iv) indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts.
837465_18_ITEM7_P102_S1	In addition, the Company has made contractual commitments to each of its officers and certain other employees providing for severance payments upon the termination of employment.
837465_18_ITEM7_P102_S2	The Company has also issued guarantees in the form of a standby letter of credit in the amount of $ 0.9 million as security for contingent liabilities under certain workers compensation insurance policies.
837465_18_ITEM7_P102_S3	The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases may be indefinite.
837465_18_ITEM7_P102_S4	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be obligated to make.
837465_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	Historically, costs incurred to settle claims related to indemnities have not been material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_18_ITEM7_P103_S1	In addition, the Company believes the likelihood is remote that payments under the commitments and guarantees described above will have a material effect on the Company s financial condition.
837465_18_ITEM7_P103_S2	The fair value of indemnities, commitments and guarantees that the Company issued during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was not material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_18_ITEM7_P103_S3	In addition to the contractual obligations listed above, the Company s liquidity could also be adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome with respect to claims and litigation that the Company is subject to from time to time.
837465_18_ITEM7_P103_S4	See Note 11 Commitments Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Capital Resources The Company does not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures.
837465_18_ITEM7_P103_S5	The Company has no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K .
837465_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Foreign Currency Fluctuations Information about the Company's foreign currency hedging activities is set forth in Note 16 Derivatives and Hedging in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by this reference.
837465_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	As part of the Company s risk management procedure, a sensitivity analysis model is used to measure the potential loss in future earnings of market-sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates or foreign currency values.
837465_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The sensitivity analysis model quantifies the estimated potential effect of unfavorable movements of 10% in foreign currencies to which the Company was exposed at December 31, 2017 through its foreign currency forward contracts.
837465_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The estimated maximum one-day loss from the Company s foreign currency forward contracts, calculated using the sensitivity analysis model described above, was $2.5 million at December 31, 2017 .
837465_18_ITEM7A_P1_S3	The Company believes that such a hypothetical loss from its foreign currency forward contracts would be partially offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged.
837465_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The sensitivity analysis model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in earnings that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates.
837465_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	It also does not represent the maximum possible loss that may occur.
837465_18_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.
837465_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The Company is exposed to interest rate risk from its credit facilities.
837465_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities accrue interest as described in Note 4 Financing Arrangements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. As part of the Company s risk management procedures, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of unfavorable changes in interest rates on the Company s cash flows.
837465_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The sensitivity analysis quantified that the incremental expense incurred by a 10% increase in interest rates would be $0.2 million over the 12-month period ending on December 31, 2017 .
837465_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
837465_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act).
837465_18_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 .
837465_18_ITEM9A_P0_S3	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in its report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013).
837465_18_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Based on that assessment, management concluded that as of December 31, 2017 , the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the COSO criteria.
837465_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting .
837465_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 , there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
837465_18_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
837465_18_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
837465_18_ITEM9A_P1_S4	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.
837465_18_ITEM9B_P0_S0	Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Callaway Golf Company and its subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
837465_18_ITEM9B_P0_S1	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
837465_18_ITEM9B_P0_S2	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
837465_18_ITEM9B_P0_S3	Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
837465_18_ITEM9B_P0_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
837465_18_ITEM9B_P0_S5	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
837465_18_ITEM9B_P0_S6	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
837465_18_ITEM9B_P0_S7	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
837465_18_ITEM9B_P0_S8	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
837465_18_ITEM9B_P0_S9	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
837465_18_ITEM9B_P1_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
837465_18_ITEM9B_P1_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
837465_18_ITEM9B_P1_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
837465_18_ITEM9B_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

837465_18_ITEM15_P26_S1	In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

837465_18_ITEM15_P26_S7	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
837465_18_ITEM15_P26_S8	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
837465_18_ITEM15_P26_S9	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

837465_18_ITEM15_P33_S3	In 2016, the Company further expanded its business into golf and lifestyle apparel and accessories with the completion of the golf apparel joint venture in Japan in July 2016.
837465_18_ITEM15_P33_S4	In 2017, the Company acquired OGIO International, Inc. ("OGIO"), a leading manufacturer of high quality bags, accessories and apparel in the golf and lifestyle categories, and TravisMathew, LLC ("TravisMathew"), a golf and lifestyle apparel company.
837465_18_ITEM15_P33_S5	These acquisitions are expected to enhance the Company's presence in golf while also providing a platform for future growth in the lifestyle category.

837465_18_ITEM15_P35_S1	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
837465_18_ITEM15_P35_S2	Examples of such estimates include provisions for warranty, uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence, sales returns, tax contingencies and provisional estimates due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") enacted in December 2017, estimates on the valuation of share-based awards and recoverability of long-lived assets and investments.
837465_18_ITEM15_P35_S3	Actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
837465_18_ITEM15_P35_S4	On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its estimates to ensure that these estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business or as new information becomes available.
837465_18_ITEM15_P36_S0	The new standard is designed to refine and expand hedge accounting for both financial (e.g., interest rate) and commodity risks.
837465_18_ITEM15_P36_S1	Its provisions create more transparency around how economic results are presented, both on the face of the financial statements and in the footnotes.
837465_18_ITEM15_P36_S2	It also makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance.
837465_18_ITEM15_P36_S3	The new standard is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
837465_18_ITEM15_P36_S4	Early adoption, including adoption in an interim period, is permitted.
837465_18_ITEM15_P36_S5	If early adoption is elected in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period (i.e., the initial application date).
837465_18_ITEM15_P36_S6	The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated condensed financial statements and disclosures.
837465_18_ITEM15_P37_S0	outflow on the statement of cash flows, (ii) the option to withhold the maximum statutory tax rate on the settlement of compensatory stock without triggering liability accounting, as well as presenting the shares withheld for the settlement of these taxes as a financing outflow on the statement of cash flows, and (iii) the option to elect a change in the accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur.
837465_18_ITEM15_P37_S1	This amendment became effective for the Company as of January 1, 2017.
837465_18_ITEM15_P37_S2	The Company adopted this ASU using the modified retrospective transition method with respect to the recognition of excess tax benefits in the consolidated condensed statement of operations.
837465_18_ITEM15_P37_S3	The adoption did not result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of January 1, 2017.
837465_18_ITEM15_P38_S0	The amendment related to the cash flow presentation of shares acquired to satisfy the Company's minimum tax withholding requirements in connection with the settlement of compensatory stock was applied retrospectively as a financing outflow.
837465_18_ITEM15_P38_S1	The adoption had no impact to any periods presented on the consolidated condensed statement of cash flows as these cash outflows have historically been presented as a financing activity.
837465_18_ITEM15_P39_S0	The Company elected not to change its accounting policy on the recognition of estimated forfeitures.
837465_18_ITEM15_P39_S1	The amendment clarifies when it is acceptable to recognize the unredeemed portion of prepaid gift cards into income, and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
837465_18_ITEM15_P39_S2	The Company does not expect the adoption of this amendment will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
837465_18_ITEM15_P39_S3	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company had $971,000 of deferred revenue related to unredeemed gift cards.
837465_18_ITEM15_P40_S0	Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.
837465_18_ITEM15_P40_S1	Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged and lessees will no longer be provided with a source of off-balance sheet financing.
837465_18_ITEM15_P40_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
837465_18_ITEM15_P41_S0	Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.
837465_18_ITEM15_P41_S1	The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented.
837465_18_ITEM15_P41_S2	Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach.
837465_18_ITEM15_P41_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
837465_18_ITEM15_P41_S4	The amendment requires (i) equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, (ii) public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes and (iii) separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables).
837465_18_ITEM15_P41_S5	This amendment eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost.
837465_18_ITEM15_P41_S6	This amendment is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
837465_18_ITEM15_P42_S0	As of December 31, 2017, the Company had an investment in Topgolf International, Inc. of $70,495,000 , consisting of common stock and various classes of preferred stock, that was accounted for at cost in accordance with ASC Topic 325, Investments Other.
837465_18_ITEM15_P42_S1	Based on prior observable market transactions, the Company believes that the fair value of its investment in Topgolf significantly exceeds its cost.
837465_18_ITEM15_P42_S2	If there are any observable price changes related to this investment or a similar investment of the same issuer in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, the Company would be required to assess the fair value impact, if any, on each class of stock, and write the individual security interest up or down to its estimated fair value, which could have a significant effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations (see Note 7 ).
837465_18_ITEM15_P43_S0	This amendment requires an entity to measure in-scope inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
837465_18_ITEM15_P43_S1	Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
837465_18_ITEM15_P43_S2	For public business entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
837465_18_ITEM15_P44_S0	The adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated condensed financial statements.
837465_18_ITEM15_P45_S0	This ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts).
837465_18_ITEM15_P46_S0	The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
837465_18_ITEM15_P46_S1	This ASU also requires additional disclosures regarding revenue and contracts with customers.
837465_18_ITEM15_P46_S2	The Company completed its analysis of this ASU, and determined that the new standard will not change the total amount of revenue recognized, only accelerate the timing of accruals of certain sales promotions and price concessions that the Company offers to its retailers to earlier in the product life cycle.
837465_18_ITEM15_P46_S3	This shift in expense will have an impact on quarter-over-quarter net sales trends.
837465_18_ITEM15_P46_S4	The Company will adopt the new standard as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach, which requires the prospective application of the new standard with disclosures of results under the old standard in order to make period over period comparisons comparable.
837465_18_ITEM15_P46_S5	Upon adoption, the Company expects to record a one-time reduction to retained earnings, net of income taxes, of approximately $11,000,000 , with a corresponding reduction to accounts receivable and an increase to deferred tax assets in its consolidated condensed balance sheet.
837465_18_ITEM15_P46_S6	Revenue Recognition Through December 31, 2017, the Company accounted for revenue recognition in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.
837465_18_ITEM15_P46_S7	As stated above, beginning on January 1, 2018, the Company will account for revenue recognition under Topic 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," which will accelerate the timing of certain sales promotions and price concessions that the Company offers to its retailers to earlier in the product life cycle.
837465_18_ITEM15_P46_S8	In accordance with Topic 605, sales are recognized, in general, as products are shipped to customers, and at point of sale for transactions in retail locations, net of an allowance for sales returns and sales programs.
837465_18_ITEM15_P46_S9	In certain cases, the Company recognizes sales when products are received by customers.
837465_18_ITEM15_P46_S10	The criteria for recognition of revenue are met when persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and both title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
837465_18_ITEM15_P47_S0	Sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through of products.
837465_18_ITEM15_P47_S1	The Company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings.
837465_18_ITEM15_P48_S0	Sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program, management s forecast of future product demand, and historical customer participation in similar programs.
837465_18_ITEM15_P48_S1	The increase in the allowance for sales returns as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 was due to a shift in the timing of one of the Company's major return programs.
837465_18_ITEM15_P48_S2	The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to the Company s allowance for sales returns:
837465_18_ITEM15_P49_S0	Revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed.
837465_18_ITEM15_P49_S1	In addition, the Company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws.
837465_18_ITEM15_P49_S2	The Company s gift cards have no expiration date.
837465_18_ITEM15_P49_S3	To determine when redemption is remote, the Company analyzes an aging of unredeemed cards (based on the date the card was last used or the activation date if the card has never been used) and compares that information with historical redemption trends.
837465_18_ITEM15_P49_S4	The deferred revenue associated with outstanding gift cards decreased to $971,000 at December 31, 2017 from $1,273,000 at December 31, 2016 .
837465_18_ITEM15_P49_S5	The amounts are recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
837465_18_ITEM15_P50_S0	Royalty income is recorded in net sales as underlying product sales occur, subject to certain minimums, in accordance with the related licensing arrangements.
837465_18_ITEM15_P50_S1	The Company recognized royalty income under its various licensing agreements of $18,622,000 , $7,622,000 and $8,062,000 during 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
837465_18_ITEM15_P50_S2	The increase in royalty income in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to royalties recognized in connection with OGIO branded products.
837465_18_ITEM15_P51_S0	Warranty Policy The Company has a stated two -year warranty policy for its golf clubs.
837465_18_ITEM15_P51_S1	The Company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded.
837465_18_ITEM15_P51_S2	In estimating its future warranty obligations, the Company considers various relevant factors, including the Company s stated warranty policies and practices, the historical frequency of claims, and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty.
837465_18_ITEM15_P51_S3	The increase in warranty expense and the claims paid in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to additional claims related to certain 2015 putter models.
837465_18_ITEM15_P51_S4	The Company believes it has resolved the quality issues related to these putters.
837465_18_ITEM15_P51_S5	The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to the Company s reserve for warranty expense:
837465_18_ITEM15_P52_S0	Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability (the exit price) in the principal and most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
837465_18_ITEM15_P52_S1	The Company measures and discloses the fair value of nonfinancial and financial assets and liabilities utilizing a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to a fair value measurement are considered to be observable or unobservable in a marketplace.
837465_18_ITEM15_P52_S2	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions.
837465_18_ITEM15_P52_S3	This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.
837465_18_ITEM15_P52_S4	The measurement of assets and liabilities at fair value are classified using the following three-tier hierarchy:
837465_18_ITEM15_P52_S5	Level 1 : Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 : Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and Level 3 :
837465_18_ITEM15_P53_S0	Fair value measurements derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
837465_18_ITEM15_P53_S1	The Company measures fair value using a set of standardized procedures that are outlined herein for all assets and liabilities which are required to be measured at fair value.
837465_18_ITEM15_P53_S2	When available, the Company utilizes quoted market prices from an independent third-party source to determine fair value and classifies such items in Level 1.
837465_18_ITEM15_P53_S3	In some instances where a market price is available, but the instrument is in an inactive or over-the-counter market, the Company consistently applies the dealer (market maker) pricing estimate and uses a midpoint approach on bid and ask prices from financial institutions to determine the reasonableness of these estimates.
837465_18_ITEM15_P53_S4	Assets and liabilities subject to this fair value valuation approach are typically classified as Level 2.
837465_18_ITEM15_P54_S0	Items valued using internally-generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
837465_18_ITEM15_P54_S1	As a result, the asset or liability could be classified in either Level 2 or Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.
837465_18_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow valuation model whenever applicable to derive a fair value measurement on long-lived assets and goodwill and intangible assets.
837465_18_ITEM15_P55_S1	The Company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate.
837465_18_ITEM15_P55_S2	The Company also considers its counterparty s and own credit risk on derivatives and other liabilities measured at their fair value.
837465_18_ITEM15_P56_S0	Advertising Costs The Company's primary advertising costs are from television and print media advertisements.
837465_18_ITEM15_P56_S1	The Company s policy is to expense advertising costs, including production costs, as incurred.
837465_18_ITEM15_P56_S2	Advertising expenses for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were $62,898,000 , $59,003,000 and $57,392,000 , respectively.
837465_18_ITEM15_P57_S0	Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
837465_18_ITEM15_P57_S1	Research and development costs for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were $36,568,000 , $ 33,318,000 and $ 33,213,000 , respectively.
837465_18_ITEM15_P58_S0	Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions A significant portion of the Company s business is conducted outside of the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
837465_18_ITEM15_P58_S1	As a result, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on the Company s financial results.
837465_18_ITEM15_P59_S0	Revenues and expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the average exchange rate for the period.
837465_18_ITEM15_P59_S1	Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date.
837465_18_ITEM15_P59_S2	Gains and losses from assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity on which they reside are generally recognized currently in the Company's statements of operations.
837465_18_ITEM15_P59_S3	Gains and losses from the translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (see Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income policy below).
837465_18_ITEM15_P59_S4	The Company recorded a net gain in foreign currency transactions of $808,000 and $226,000 in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and a net loss of $1,611,000 in 2015 .
837465_18_ITEM15_P60_S0	Derivatives and Hedging In order to mitigate the impact of foreign currency translation on transactions, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts that are accounted for as non-designated and designated hedges pursuant to ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ("ASC Topic 815").
837465_18_ITEM15_P60_S1	ASC Topic 815 requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, measure those instruments at fair value and recognize changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change unless the derivative qualifies as designated cash flow hedge that offsets certain exposures.
837465_18_ITEM15_P61_S0	Certain criteria must be satisfied in order for derivative financial instruments to be classified and accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
837465_18_ITEM15_P61_S1	Gains and losses from the remeasurement of qualifying cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and released into earnings as a component of cost of goods sold or net sales during the period in which the hedged transaction takes place.
837465_18_ITEM15_P61_S2	Gains and losses on the ineffective portion of hedges (hedges that do not meet accounting requirements due to ineffectiveness) and derivatives that are not elected for hedge accounting treatment are immediately recorded in earnings as a component of other income (expense).
837465_18_ITEM15_P62_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less.
837465_18_ITEM15_P62_S1	The Company records its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.
837465_18_ITEM15_P62_S2	This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts.
837465_18_ITEM15_P63_S0	An estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, the customer s financial condition and current economic trends, all of which are subject to change.
837465_18_ITEM15_P63_S1	Actual uncollected amounts have historically been consistent with the Company s expectations.
837465_18_ITEM15_P63_S2	In general, the Company has trade insurance to mitigate the risk of uncollectible accounts on its outstanding accounts receivable.
837465_18_ITEM15_P63_S3	The Company considers this insurance coverage when estimating its provision for uncollectible accounts.
837465_18_ITEM15_P63_S4	Insurance claim recoveries from this trade insurance are applied to the Company s outstanding accounts receivable or are recorded as a reduction to bad debt expense in the period in which the claim is received.
837465_18_ITEM15_P63_S5	The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to the Company s allowance for doubtful accounts:
837465_18_ITEM15_P64_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
837465_18_ITEM15_P65_S0	Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
837465_18_ITEM15_P66_S0	The inventory balance, which includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs, is recorded net of an estimate for obsolete or unmarketable inventory.
837465_18_ITEM15_P66_S1	This estimate is based upon current inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience as well as management s estimates of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand, all of which are subject to change.
837465_18_ITEM15_P67_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
837465_18_ITEM15_P68_S0	Normal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
837465_18_ITEM15_P68_S1	Expenditures that materially increase values, change capacities or extend useful lives are capitalized.
837465_18_ITEM15_P68_S2	The related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income/(loss).
837465_18_ITEM15_P69_S0	Construction in-process consists primarily of costs associated with building improvements, machinery and equipment that have not yet been placed into service, unfinished molds as well as in-process internally developed software.
837465_18_ITEM15_P70_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 350-40, Internal-Use Software, the Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal use software.
837465_18_ITEM15_P70_S1	Costs incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed.
837465_18_ITEM15_P70_S2	All direct external costs incurred to develop internal-use software during the development stage are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful lives.
837465_18_ITEM15_P70_S3	Costs such as maintenance and training are expensed as incurred.
837465_18_ITEM15_P71_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-35, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , the Company assesses potential impairments of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying value may not be recoverable.
837465_18_ITEM15_P71_S1	An impairment charge would be recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.
837465_18_ITEM15_P71_S2	The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group.
837465_18_ITEM15_P72_S0	Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets, which consist of trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, patents and other intangible assets, were acquired in connection with the acquisition of Odyssey Sports, Inc. in 1997, FrogTrader, Inc. in 2004, OGIO in January 2017, TravisMathew in August 2017, and certain foreign distributors.
837465_18_ITEM15_P73_S0	In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events indicate that an impairment exists.
837465_18_ITEM15_P73_S1	The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets over their estimated fair value.
837465_18_ITEM15_P73_S2	If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded.
837465_18_ITEM15_P73_S3	To determine fair value, the Company uses its internal discounted cash flow estimates, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals when appropriate.
837465_18_ITEM15_P73_S4	The Company completed its annual impairment test and fair value analysis of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2017 , and the estimated fair values of the Company s reporting units, as well as the estimated fair values of certain trade names and trademarks, significantly exceeded their carrying values.
837465_18_ITEM15_P73_S5	As a result, no impairment was recorded as of December 31, 2017 .
837465_18_ITEM15_P74_S0	Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-35 discussed above.
837465_18_ITEM15_P74_S1	See Note 6 for further discussion of the Company s goodwill and intangible assets.
837465_18_ITEM15_P75_S0	Investments The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of acquisition and reevaluates such classification at each balance sheet date.
837465_18_ITEM15_P75_S1	Investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are stated at cost.
837465_18_ITEM15_P76_S0	The Company monitors investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the investment's carrying value may not be recoverable.
837465_18_ITEM15_P76_S1	An impairment charge would be recognized when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
837465_18_ITEM15_P76_S2	See Note 7 for further discussion of the Company s investments.
837465_18_ITEM15_P77_S0	The Company accounts for its share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ( ASC Topic 718 ), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and non-employees based on estimated fair values.
837465_18_ITEM15_P77_S1	ASC Topic 718 further requires a reduction in share-based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate.
837465_18_ITEM15_P78_S0	The forfeiture rate used by the Company is based on historical forfeiture trends.
837465_18_ITEM15_P78_S1	If actual forfeiture rates are not consistent with the Company s estimates, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods.
837465_18_ITEM15_P79_S0	Performance share units are stock-based awards in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on the Company's performance against specified goals that are measured over a designated performance period from the date of grant.
837465_18_ITEM15_P79_S1	These performance goals are established by the Company at the beginning of the performance period.
837465_18_ITEM15_P79_S2	At the end of the performance period, the number of shares of stock that could be issued is fixed based upon the degree of achievement of the performance goals.
837465_18_ITEM15_P79_S3	The number of shares that could be issued can range from 0% to 200% of the participant's target award.
837465_18_ITEM15_P80_S0	Performance share units are initially valued at the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant.
837465_18_ITEM15_P80_S1	Compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the vesting period and will vary based on the anticipated performance level during the performance period.
837465_18_ITEM15_P80_S2	If the performance goals are not probable of achievement during the performance period, compensation expense would be reversed.
837465_18_ITEM15_P80_S3	The awards are forfeited if the performance goals are not achieved as of the end of the performance period.
837465_18_ITEM15_P81_S0	The performance units vest in full at the end of a three -year period.
837465_18_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options and stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) at the date of grant.
837465_18_ITEM15_P82_S1	The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions to calculate the value of stock options/SARs.
837465_18_ITEM15_P82_S2	The Company uses historical data among other information to estimate the expected price volatility, expected term and forfeiture rate.
837465_18_ITEM15_P82_S3	The Company uses forecasted dividends to estimate the expected dividend yield.
837465_18_ITEM15_P82_S4	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
837465_18_ITEM15_P83_S0	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for stock options.
837465_18_ITEM15_P83_S1	Compensation expense for SARs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on an estimated fair value, which is remeasured at the end of each reporting period.
837465_18_ITEM15_P83_S2	Once vested, the SARs continue to be remeasured to fair value until they are exercised.
837465_18_ITEM15_P84_S0	The Company records compensation expense for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (collectively restricted stock ) based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
837465_18_ITEM15_P84_S1	The estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the award date multiplied by the number of shares underlying the restricted stock awarded.
837465_18_ITEM15_P84_S2	Total compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
837465_18_ITEM15_P85_S0	Phantom stock units are a form of share-based awards that are indexed to the Company s stock and are settled in cash.
837465_18_ITEM15_P86_S0	Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the award s estimated fair value.
837465_18_ITEM15_P86_S1	Fair value is remeasured at the end of each interim reporting period through the award s settlement date and is based on the closing price of the Company s stock.
837465_18_ITEM15_P87_S0	Income Taxes Current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year.
837465_18_ITEM15_P88_S0	A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to ASC Topic 740 and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
837465_18_ITEM15_P88_S1	The Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
837465_18_ITEM15_P88_S2	In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire.
837465_18_ITEM15_P88_S3	These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment, including estimates of future taxable income.
837465_18_ITEM15_P89_S0	made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions.
837465_18_ITEM15_P89_S1	In 2011, as a result of this evaluation, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_18_ITEM15_P89_S2	During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company reversed a significant portion of the valuation allowance on those deferred tax assets.
837465_18_ITEM15_P89_S3	For further information, see Note 10 Income Taxes .
837465_18_ITEM15_P89_S4	Pursuant to ASC Topic 740-25-6, the Company is required to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is deemed to be more likely than not that the Company would be required to pay such additional taxes.
837465_18_ITEM15_P89_S5	The Company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions.
837465_18_ITEM15_P89_S6	The preparation of these income tax returns requires the Company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by the Company.
837465_18_ITEM15_P89_S7	The Company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability, including interest and penalties in income tax expense, for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return.
837465_18_ITEM15_P89_S8	The Company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available.
837465_18_ITEM15_P90_S0	Historically, additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the Company s uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the Company s expectations.
837465_18_ITEM15_P90_S1	The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
837465_18_ITEM15_P90_S2	For further information, see Note 10 Income Taxes .
837465_18_ITEM15_P91_S0	On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
837465_18_ITEM15_P91_S1	Shortly after the Tax Act was enacted, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("SAB 118"), which provides guidance on accounting for the Tax Act s impact.
837465_18_ITEM15_P91_S2	SAB 118 provides a measurement period, which should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date, during which a company acting in good faith may complete the accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act under ASC Topic 740.
837465_18_ITEM15_P91_S3	In accordance with SAB 118, the Company must reflect the income tax effects of the Tax Act in the reporting period in which the accounting under ASC Topic 740 is complete.
837465_18_ITEM15_P91_S4	To the extent that the Company s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete, the Company can determine a reasonable estimate for those effects and record a provisional estimate in the consolidated financial statements in the first reporting period in which a reasonable estimate can be determined.
837465_18_ITEM15_P91_S5	If the Company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the consolidated financial statements, the Company should continue to apply ASC Topic 740 based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the Tax Act being enacted.

837465_18_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Company has three operating segments, namely Golf Clubs, Golf Balls and Gear, Accessories and Other as of December 31, 2017.
837465_18_ITEM15_P96_S0	Prior to 2017, the Company's operating segments consisted of Golf Clubs and Golf Balls.
837465_18_ITEM15_P96_S1	Due to the recent growth in the accessories and other product category within Golf Clubs from the formation of the apparel joint venture in Japan as well as the Company's acquisition of OGIO in January 2017, the Company reassessed its operating segments during the first quarter of 2017, consistent with the way management reviews its business operations on an ongoing basis.

837465_18_ITEM15_P96_S8	As a result of these changes, prior period amounts have been reclassified in order to make prior periods comparable to 2017.
837465_18_ITEM15_P96_S9	This information, as well as information about the Company's geographic areas, is presented in Note 17 Segment Information .
837465_18_ITEM15_P97_S0	Concentration of Risk The Company operates in the golf equipment industry and has a concentrated customer base, which is primarily comprised of golf equipment retailers (including pro shops at golf courses and off-course retailers), sporting goods retailers and mass merchants and foreign distributors.

837465_18_ITEM15_P98_S0	A loss of one or more of these customers could have a significant effect on the Company's net sales.
837465_18_ITEM15_P98_S1	Prior period percentages have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation as the result of the change in operating segments as of January 1, 2017.
837465_18_ITEM15_P98_S2	For further discussion, see Note 17 Segment Information .
837465_18_ITEM15_P99_S0	With respect to the Company's trade receivables, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally requires no collateral from these customers.
837465_18_ITEM15_P99_S1	The Company maintains reserves for estimated credit losses, which it considers adequate to cover any such losses.
837465_18_ITEM15_P99_S2	At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , no single customer represented over 9% of the Company s outstanding accounts receivable balance.
837465_18_ITEM15_P100_S0	Managing customer-related credit risk is more difficult in regions outside of the United States.
837465_18_ITEM15_P100_S1	Of the Company s total net sales, approximately 46% , 49% and 47% were derived from sales outside of the United States in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
837465_18_ITEM15_P101_S0	Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions could significantly increase the Company s credit risk with respect to its outstanding accounts receivable.
837465_18_ITEM15_P102_S0	The Company is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for its clubheads and shafts, some of which are single sourced.
837465_18_ITEM15_P102_S1	Furthermore, some of the Company s products require specially developed manufacturing techniques and processes which make it difficult to identify and utilize alternative suppliers quickly.
837465_18_ITEM15_P102_S2	In addition, many of the Company s suppliers are not well capitalized and prolonged unfavorable economic conditions could increase the risk that they will go out of business.
837465_18_ITEM15_P102_S3	If current suppliers are unable to deliver clubheads, shafts or other components, or if the Company is required to transition to other suppliers, the Company could experience significant production delays or disruption to its business.
837465_18_ITEM15_P102_S4	The Company also depends on a single or a limited number of suppliers for the materials it uses to make its golf balls.
837465_18_ITEM15_P102_S5	Many of these materials are customized for the Company.
837465_18_ITEM15_P102_S6	Any delay or interruption in such supplies could have a material adverse impact on the Company s golf ball business.
837465_18_ITEM15_P102_S7	If the Company were to experience any such delays or interruptions, the Company may not be able to find adequate alternative suppliers at a reasonable cost or without significant disruption to its business.
837465_18_ITEM15_P103_S0	The Company s financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, trade receivables and foreign currency forward contracts.
837465_18_ITEM15_P103_S1	From time to time, the Company invests its excess cash in money market accounts and short-term U.S. government securities and has established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities in an effort to maintain safety and liquidity.
837465_18_ITEM15_P103_S2	These guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of trends in yields and interest rates.
837465_18_ITEM15_P104_S0	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts for the purpose of hedging foreign exchange rate exposures on existing or anticipated transactions.
837465_18_ITEM15_P104_S1	In the event of a failure to honor one of these contracts by one of the banks with which the Company has contracted, management believes any loss would be limited to the exchange rate differential from the time the contract was made until the time it was settled.
837465_18_ITEM15_P105_S0	Business Combinations During 2017, the Company completed the acquisitions of OGIO and TravisMathew.
837465_18_ITEM15_P106_S0	The excess between the purchase price and the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill.
837465_18_ITEM15_P106_S1	The Company determined the estimated fair values after review and consideration of relevant information, including discounted cash flows, quoted market prices and estimates made by management.
837465_18_ITEM15_P106_S2	The Company may retrospectively adjust the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, as necessary, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, to reflect new information existing at the acquisition date affecting the measurement of those amounts at that date, and any additional assets or liabilities existing at that date.
837465_18_ITEM15_P106_S3	Valuations of acquired intangible assets and inventory are subject to fair value measurements that were based primarily on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements (see Note 15 ).
837465_18_ITEM15_P106_S4	Both acquisitions were treated as asset purchases for income tax purposes and, as such, the Company expects to deduct all of the intangible assets, including goodwill.
837465_18_ITEM15_P107_S0	On January 11, 2017, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of OGIO, a leading manufacturer of high quality bags, accessories and apparel in the golf and lifestyle categories, in a cash transaction pursuant to the terms of a Share Purchase Agreement, by and among the Company, OGIO, and each of the shareholders and option holders of OGIO.

837465_18_ITEM15_P107_S4	The trade name was valued under the royalty savings income approach method, which is equal to the present value of the after-tax royalty savings attributable to owning the trade name as opposed to paying a third party for its use.
837465_18_ITEM15_P107_S5	For this valuation, the Company used a royalty rate of 7.5% , which is reflective of royalty rates paid in market transactions, and a discount rate of 14.0% on the future cash flows generated by the net after-tax savings.
837465_18_ITEM15_P108_S0	Goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of the synergies expected from combining the operations of the Company and OGIO.
837465_18_ITEM15_P108_S1	For segment reporting purposes, goodwill is reported in the Gear, Accessories and Other operating segment.
837465_18_ITEM15_P108_S2	The total purchase price was valued at $65,951,000 .

837465_18_ITEM15_P109_S3	The acquired furniture, fixtures, office equipment, leasehold improvements, computer equipment and warehouse equipment were all valued at their estimated replacement cost, which the Company determined approximated the net book value of the assets on the date of the acquisition.

837465_18_ITEM15_P122_S2	In connection with these convertible notes, the Company incurred transactional fees of $3,537,000 .
837465_18_ITEM15_P122_S3	During the second half of 2015, the convertible notes were retired pursuant to certain exchange transactions and shareholder conversions, which resulted, among other things, in the issuance of approximately 15,000,000 shares of common stock to the note holders.

837465_18_ITEM15_P125_S2	Goodwill also increased $1,311,000 due to foreign currency fluctuations.
837465_18_ITEM15_P125_S3	The Company's goodwill is reported within the Golf Clubs and Gear, Accessories and Other operating segments (see Note 17).
837465_18_ITEM15_P125_S4	In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, the Company s goodwill and certain intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject to an annual impairment test.
837465_18_ITEM15_P125_S5	The following sets forth the intangible assets by major asset class:
837465_18_ITEM15_P126_S0	The increase in intangible assets is related to the acquisition of non-amortizing trademarks, trade names and goodwill in addition to amortizing intangibles in connection with the OGIO and TravisMathew acquisitions.
837465_18_ITEM15_P126_S1	Aggregate amortization expense on intangible assets was approximately $546,000 , $71,000 and $51,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
837465_18_ITEM15_P126_S2	Amortization expense related to intangible assets at December 31, 2017 in each of the next five fiscal years and beyond is expected to be incurred as follows (in thousands):
837465_18_ITEM15_P127_S0	Investments Investment in Topgolf International, Inc.
837465_18_ITEM15_P128_S0	The Company owns a minority interest in Topgolf International, Inc., doing business as the Topgolf Entertainment Group ( Topgolf ), the owner and operator of Topgolf entertainment centers, which ownership consists of common stock and various classes of preferred stock.
837465_18_ITEM15_P128_S1	In connection with this investment, the Company has a preferred partner agreement with Topgolf in which the Company has preferred signage rights, rights as the preferred supplier of golf products used or offered for use at Topgolf facilities at prices no less than those paid by the Company s customers, preferred retail positioning in the Topgolf retail stores, access to consumer information obtained by Topgolf, and other rights incidental to those listed above.
837465_18_ITEM15_P128_S2	The Company invested $21,499,000 , $1,448,000 and $940,000 in shares of Topgolf in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
837465_18_ITEM15_P128_S3	In December, 2017, Topgolf announced that it had completed a private placement led by Fidelity Management and Research Company (the "Fidelity Investment"), in which the Company invested $20,000,000 in preferred shares of Topgolf.
837465_18_ITEM15_P128_S4	Due to the nature and timing of this transaction, the Company believes the carrying value of its series F preferred shares that were purchased in this private placement, approximates fair value as of December 31, 2017.
837465_18_ITEM15_P128_S5	The Company is unable to estimate the fair value of its other series of preferred stock or common stock due to the dissimilar nature of conversion rights, liquidation features and other preferred terms of these shares relative to the series F preferred shares.
837465_18_ITEM15_P128_S6	Further, it would not be practicable for the Company to determine the discount, if any, that would be applicable to any preferred terms, as well as any other rights provided to the holders of the various series of preferred stock, nor a premium, if any, for the incremental value that might apply in the case of a change in control transaction (e.g. an initial public offering or sale of Topgolf).
837465_18_ITEM15_P129_S0	The Company s Topgolf shares are illiquid and there is no assurance that all classes of Topgolf shares would receive equivalent value upon a sale or other liquidation.
837465_18_ITEM15_P129_S1	Due to these factors, the Company believes that it is not practicable on a cost-benefit basis to estimate the fair value of its Topgolf shares.
837465_18_ITEM15_P130_S0	In February 2016, Topgolf announced that Providence Equity Partners L.L.C. ( Providence Equity ) made a significant minority preferred stock investment in Topgolf (the Providence Equity Investment ).
837465_18_ITEM15_P130_S1	As required by the terms of the Providence Equity Investment, Topgolf used a portion of the proceeds it received to repurchase shares from its existing shareholders, other than Providence Equity (the Topgolf Repurchase Program ).
837465_18_ITEM15_P130_S2	In April 2016, the Company sold approximately 10.0% or $5,767,000 (on a cost basis) of its preferred shares in Topgolf under the Topgolf Repurchase Program for $23,429,000 , and recognized a gain of approximately $17,662,000 in other income (expense) during the second quarter.
837465_18_ITEM15_P130_S3	In December 2015, the Company and Topgolf entered into a shareholder loan agreement, which resulted in a note receivable from Topgolf for $3,200,000 .
837465_18_ITEM15_P130_S4	The loan was subject to an annual interest rate of 10% , and was due and payable on March 30, 2016.
837465_18_ITEM15_P130_S5	The loan was paid in full in February 2016.
837465_18_ITEM15_P130_S6	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the Company's total investment in Topgolf was $70,495,000 and $48,997,000 , respectively.
837465_18_ITEM15_P130_S7	The Company's ownership percentage at December 31, 2017 was approximately 14.0% .
837465_18_ITEM15_P130_S8	As of December 31, 2017 , there were no impairment indicators present with respect to this investment.
837465_18_ITEM15_P130_S9	Based on prior observable market transactions, the Company believes that the fair value of its investment in Topgolf significantly exceeds its cost.
837465_18_ITEM15_P130_S10	In accordance with ASU No. 2016-01, "Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," if there are any observable price changes related to this investment or a similar investment of the same issuer, in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, the Company would be required to assess the fair value impact, if any, on each class of stock, and write the individual security interest up or down to its estimated fair value, which could have a significant effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations.
837465_18_ITEM15_P130_S11	For further discussion, see Recent Accounting Standards in Note 2.
837465_18_ITEM15_P131_S0	The Company s total ownership interest in Topgolf, including the Company's voting rights in the preferred shares of Topgolf, remains at less than 20.0% of the outstanding equity securities of Topgolf.
837465_18_ITEM15_P131_S1	Therefore, the Company does not have the ability to significantly influence the operating and financing activities and policies of Topgolf.
837465_18_ITEM15_P131_S2	Accordingly, this investment is accounted for at cost as of December 31, 2017 .
837465_18_ITEM15_P132_S0	Joint Venture Effective July 1, 2016, the Company completed the previously announced joint venture with its long-time apparel licensee, TSI Groove Sports Co, Ltd., ("TSI"), a premier apparel manufacturer in Japan.
837465_18_ITEM15_P132_S1	The new venture is named Callaway Apparel K.K. and includes the design, manufacture and distribution of Callaway-branded apparel, footwear and headwear in Japan.
837465_18_ITEM15_P133_S0	primarily in inventory, for the remaining 48% .
837465_18_ITEM15_P133_S1	The Company has a majority voting percentage on matters pertaining to the business operations and significant management decisions of the joint venture, and as such, the Company is required to consolidate the financial results of the joint venture with the financial results of the Company.
837465_18_ITEM15_P133_S2	The joint venture was consolidated one month in arrears.
837465_18_ITEM15_P133_S3	As a result of the consolidation, during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded net income attributable to the non-controlling interest of $861,000 and $1,054,000 , respectively.
837465_18_ITEM15_P133_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2017 , the joint venture paid a dividend of $974,000 to TSI, which was recorded as a reduction in non-controlling interests in the consolidated condensed financial statements as of December 31, 2017 .
837465_18_ITEM15_P133_S5	Total non-controlling interests on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of shareholders' equity was $9,744,000 and $9,694,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
837465_18_ITEM15_P134_S0	Income Taxes The Company s income before income tax provision was subject to taxes in the following jurisdictions for the following periods (in thousands):
837465_18_ITEM15_P135_S0	The expense (benefit) for income taxes is comprised of (in thousands):
837465_18_ITEM15_P136_S0	(1) Income before income taxes in 2016 includes a gain of $17,662,000 that was recognized in connection with the sale of preferred shares of the Company's investment in Topgolf.
837465_18_ITEM15_P136_S1	See Note 7 for further discussion.
837465_18_ITEM15_P136_S2	(2) The income tax benefit for 2016 includes the reversal of a significant portion of the valuation allowance on the Company's deferred tax assets in the U.S. See further discussion below.
837465_18_ITEM15_P137_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into legislation, which includes a broad range of provisions affecting businesses.
837465_18_ITEM15_P137_S1	The Tax Act significantly revises how companies compute their U.S corporate tax liability by, among other provisions, reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, implementing a territorial tax system, and requiring a mandatory one-time tax on U.S. owned undistributed foreign earnings and profits known as the toll charge or transition tax.
837465_18_ITEM15_P138_S0	No. 118, "Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" ("SAB 118"), a company may select among one of three scenarios to reflect the impact of the Tax Act in its financial statements within a measurement period.
837465_18_ITEM15_P138_S1	Those scenarios are (i) a final estimate which effectively closes the measurement period; (ii) a reasonable estimate leaving the measurement period open for future revisions; and (iii) no estimate as the law is still being analyzed in which case a company continues to apply its accounting on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act.
837465_18_ITEM15_P139_S0	SAB 118 allows for the reporting provisional of amounts for certain income tax effects in scenarios (ii) and (iii).
837465_18_ITEM15_P140_S0	The measurement period begins in the reporting period that includes the Tax Act s enactment date and ends when an entity has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information that was needed in order to complete the accounting requirements under ASC Topic 740.
837465_18_ITEM15_P140_S1	The Company was able to provide a reasonable estimate for the revaluation of deferred taxes and the effects of the toll charge on undistributed foreign earnings and profits, with the Company's measurement period open for future revisions.
837465_18_ITEM15_P140_S2	As such, the Company recorded a provisional tax expense in the amount of $11,174,000 related to the revaluation of deferred taxes, and a provisional tax benefit in the amount of $3,638,000 for the toll charge on the deemed repatriation on earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign subsidiaries, which generated foreign tax credits in excess of the tax expense recognized on the deemed repatriation.
837465_18_ITEM15_P140_S3	The Company is still evaluating various provisions included in the Tax Act and has therefore not provided a final estimate.
837465_18_ITEM15_P140_S4	These provisions include, but are not limited to, the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provisions, the foreign derived intangible income (FDII) provisions, and the changes to the deductibility of interest.
837465_18_ITEM15_P141_S0	provisions will be effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018, and may materially impact the Company s effective tax rate in future years.
837465_18_ITEM15_P142_S0	Significant components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows (in thousands):
837465_18_ITEM15_P143_S0	The net change in net deferred taxes in 2017 of $23,535,000 is comprised of the utilization of net operating losses through profitable operations and the revaluation of the deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act.
837465_18_ITEM15_P143_S1	Pursuant to the Tax Act, the Company revalued its gross deferred tax assets from 35% to 21% consistent with the corporate tax rate effective January 1, 2018.
837465_18_ITEM15_P143_S2	The provisional net tax impact of this revaluation was a reduction in net deferred tax assets of $11,174,000 .
837465_18_ITEM15_P144_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are anticipated to be in effect at the time the differences are expected to reverse.
837465_18_ITEM15_P144_S1	The realization of the deferred tax assets, including loss and credit carry forwards, is subject to the Company generating sufficient taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become realizable.
837465_18_ITEM15_P144_S2	In accordance with the applicable accounting rules, the Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
837465_18_ITEM15_P144_S3	In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire.
837465_18_ITEM15_P144_S4	These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment, including estimates of future taxable income.
837465_18_ITEM15_P144_S5	These estimates are based on the Company s best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions.
837465_18_ITEM15_P145_S0	In 2011, the Company established a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_18_ITEM15_P146_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company evaluated all available positive and negative evidence, including the Company's improved profitability in 2015 and 2016, combined with future projections of profitability.
837465_18_ITEM15_P146_S1	As a result, the Company determined that the majority of its U.S.
837465_18_ITEM15_P147_S0	deferred tax assets were more likely than not to be realized and reversed a significant portion of the valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets accordingly.
837465_18_ITEM15_P147_S1	The remaining valuation allowance on the Company's U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 relate primarily to state net operating loss carryforwards and credits the Company estimates it may not be able to utilize in future periods.
837465_18_ITEM15_P147_S2	With respect to non-U.S. entities, there continues to be sufficient positive evidence to conclude that realization of its deferred tax assets is more likely than not under applicable accounting rules, and no significant allowances have been established.
837465_18_ITEM15_P147_S3	At December 31, 2017 , the Company had federal and state income tax credit carryforwards of $56,285,000 and $15,499,000 , respectively, which will expire at various dates beginning in 2021 .
837465_18_ITEM15_P147_S4	Such credit carryforwards expire as follows (in thousands):
837465_18_ITEM15_P148_S0	The Company has recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the benefit of operating loss carryforwards.
837465_18_ITEM15_P148_S1	The net operating losses expire as follows (in thousands):
837465_18_ITEM15_P149_S0	The Company s ability to utilize the losses and credits to offset future taxable income may be deferred or limited significantly if the Company were to experience an ownership change as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
837465_18_ITEM15_P149_S1	In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in ownership of the Company s stock by 5-percent shareholders (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
837465_18_ITEM15_P149_S2	The Company determined that no ownership change has occurred for purposes of Section 382 for the period ended December 31, 2017 .
837465_18_ITEM15_P150_S0	A reconciliation of the effective tax rate on income or loss and the statutory tax rate is as follows:
837465_18_ITEM15_P151_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):
837465_18_ITEM15_P152_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , the gross liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax benefits was $9,300,000 .
837465_18_ITEM15_P152_S1	This liability could be reduced by $1,360,000 of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, which was recorded as a long-term income tax receivable, as well as $6,317,000 of deferred taxes.
837465_18_ITEM15_P152_S2	The net amount of $1,623,000 , if recognized, would affect the Company s financial statements and favorably affect the Company s effective income tax rate.

837465_18_ITEM15_P154_S1	Pursuant to the Tax Act, the Company s undistributed foreign earnings and profits were deemed repatriated as of December 31, 2017.
837465_18_ITEM15_P154_S2	As a result, the Company utilized $72,800,000 of net operating losses, which decreased deferred tax assets by approximately $25,500,000 and generated foreign tax credits of $29,100,000 , which increased deferred tax assets by $29,100,000 and resulted in a net tax benefit of $3,600,000 or a 5.2% benefit to the tax rate.
837465_18_ITEM15_P154_S3	The Company has not provided deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding taxes and certain state income taxes on the undistributed earnings and profits from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that will be permanently reinvested outside the United States.
837465_18_ITEM15_P154_S4	Upon the distribution of foreign earnings and profits, certain foreign countries impose withholding taxes, subject to certain limitations, for use as credits against the Company s U.S. tax liability, if any.
837465_18_ITEM15_P154_S5	If the foreign earnings and profits were distributed, the Company would need to accrue an additional income tax liability.
837465_18_ITEM15_P154_S6	However, the Company may also be allowed a credit against substantially all the Company s U.S. tax liability for the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions.

837465_18_ITEM15_P155_S1	The Company also receives from time to time information claiming that products sold by the Company infringe or may infringe patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties.
837465_18_ITEM15_P155_S2	One or more such claims of potential infringement could lead to litigation, the need to obtain licenses, the need to alter a product to avoid infringement, a settlement or judgment or some other action or material loss by the Company, which also could adversely affect the Company s overall ability to protect its product designs and ultimately limit its future success in the marketplace.
837465_18_ITEM15_P155_S3	In addition, the Company is occasionally subject to non-routine claims, proceedings or investigations.
837465_18_ITEM15_P155_S4	The Company regularly assesses such matters to determine the degree of probability that the Company will incur a material loss as a result of such matters as well as the range of possible loss.
837465_18_ITEM15_P156_S0	An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the Company s financial statements if it is probable the Company will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
837465_18_ITEM15_P156_S1	The Company reviews all claims, proceedings and investigations at least quarterly and establishes or adjusts any accruals for such matters to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.

837465_18_ITEM15_P157_S2	These matters are inherently unpredictable and the resolutions of these matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcomes are not predictable with assurance.
837465_18_ITEM15_P157_S3	Consequently, management is unable to estimate the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary loss, amounts covered by insurance or the financial impact that will result from such matters.
837465_18_ITEM15_P157_S4	In addition, the Company cannot assure that it will be able to successfully defend itself in those matters or that any amounts accrued are sufficient.
837465_18_ITEM15_P157_S5	The Company does not believe that the matters currently pending against the Company will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations on an annual basis.

837465_18_ITEM15_P162_S5	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be obligated to make.
837465_18_ITEM15_P163_S0	Historically, costs incurred to settle claims related to indemnities have not been material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
837465_18_ITEM15_P163_S1	In addition, the Company believes the likelihood is remote that payments under the commitments and guarantees described above will have a material effect on the Company s financial condition.
837465_18_ITEM15_P163_S2	The fair value of indemnities, commitments and guarantees that the Company issued during and as of the year ended December 31, 2017 was not material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

837465_18_ITEM15_P175_S3	The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
837465_18_ITEM15_P175_S4	The model uses various assumptions, including a risk-free interest rate, the expected term of the options, the expected stock price volatility, and the expected dividend yield.
837465_18_ITEM15_P176_S0	Compensation expense for employee stock options is recognized over the vesting term and is reduced by an estimate for forfeitures, which is based on the Company s historical forfeitures of unvested options and awards.
837465_18_ITEM15_P176_S1	The Company did not grant stock options during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .

837465_18_ITEM15_P177_S1	The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock.
837465_18_ITEM15_P177_S2	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected term of the options at the date of the grant.
837465_18_ITEM15_P177_S3	The expected life of the Company s options is based on evaluations of historical employee exercise behavior, forfeitures, cancellations and other factors.
837465_18_ITEM15_P177_S4	The valuation model applied in this calculation utilizes highly subjective assumptions that could potentially change over time.
837465_18_ITEM15_P177_S5	Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option.
837465_18_ITEM15_P177_S6	Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by the employee holding the option.
837465_18_ITEM15_P177_S7	The following table summarizes the Company s stock option activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 (in thousands, except price per share and contractual term):

837465_18_ITEM15_P185_S1	The expense recognized over the vesting period is adjusted up or down based on the anticipated performance level during the performance period.
837465_18_ITEM15_P185_S2	If the performance metrics are not probable of achievement during the performance period, compensation expense would be reversed.
837465_18_ITEM15_P185_S3	The awards are forfeited if the threshold performance metrics are not achieved as of the end of the performance period.
837465_18_ITEM15_P186_S0	The performance share units cliff-vest in full three years from the date of grant.

837465_18_ITEM15_P198_S0	(1) The carrying value of amounts outstanding under the Primary Asset-Based Revolving and the Japan ABL credit facilities approximate the fair value due to the short term nature of these obligations.
837465_18_ITEM15_P198_S1	The fair value of this debt is categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
837465_18_ITEM15_P198_S2	See Note 4 for information on the Company's credit facilities, including certain risks and uncertainties related thereto.

837465_18_ITEM15_P198_S8	The fair value of this contingent obligation is categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
837465_18_ITEM15_P199_S0	(4) The carrying value of the money market funds approximates fair value as the funds are highly liquid and short-term in nature.
837465_18_ITEM15_P199_S1	The funds seek to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per share, and the market value per share of these funds are available in active markets.

837465_18_ITEM15_P202_S0	Derivatives and Hedging In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions of its international subsidiaries.
837465_18_ITEM15_P202_S1	As part of its strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company uses designated cash flow hedges and non-designated hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency translation on transactions that are denominated primarily in Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Euros, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Korean Won.
837465_18_ITEM15_P202_S2	The Company accounts for its foreign currency forward contracts in accordance with ASC Topic 815, "Derivatives and Hedging" ("ASC Topic 815").
837465_18_ITEM15_P202_S3	ASC Topic 815 requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, the measurement of those instruments at fair value and the recognition of changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change, unless the derivative qualifies as a designated cash flow hedge that offsets certain exposures.
837465_18_ITEM15_P202_S4	Certain criteria must be satisfied in order for derivative financial instruments to be classified and accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
837465_18_ITEM15_P203_S0	Gains and losses on the ineffective portion of hedges (hedges that do not meet accounting requirements due to ineffectiveness) and derivatives that are not elected for hedge accounting treatment are immediately recorded in earnings as a component of other income (expense).

837465_18_ITEM15_P204_S1	The Company does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for speculative purposes.
837465_18_ITEM15_P204_S2	The Company utilizes counterparties for its derivative instruments that it believes are credit-worthy at the time the transactions are entered into and the Company closely monitors the credit ratings of these counterparties.
837465_18_ITEM15_P204_S3	The following table summarizes the fair value of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts as well as the location of the asset and/or liability on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):

837465_18_ITEM15_P208_S0	Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:
837465_18_ITEM15_P209_S0	The Company's foreign currency forward contracts are subject to a master netting agreement with each respective counterparty bank and are therefore net settled at their maturity date.
837465_18_ITEM15_P209_S1	Although the Company has the legal right of offset under the master netting agreements, the Company has elected not to present these contracts on a net settlement amount basis, and therefore present these contracts on a gross basis on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
837465_18_ITEM15_P210_S0	The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments to help mitigate the Company's foreign currency exposure on intercompany sales of inventory to its foreign subsidiaries.

837465_18_ITEM15_P210_S3	The reporting of gains and losses on these cash flow hedging instruments depends on whether the gains or losses are effective at offsetting changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged items.
837465_18_ITEM15_P211_S0	The Company uses the critical terms method to measure the effectiveness of the foreign currency forward contracts and evaluates the effectiveness on a quarterly basis.
837465_18_ITEM15_P212_S0	The effective portion of the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income until recognized in earnings during the period that the hedged transactions take place.
837465_18_ITEM15_P212_S1	Any ineffective portion of the gains and losses from the hedging instruments is recognized in earnings immediately.
837465_18_ITEM15_P213_S0	The Company would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively (i) if it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item, (ii) when the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, (iii) if it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction being hedged by the derivative will not occur, (iv) if a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment, or (v) if it is determined that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate.
837465_18_ITEM15_P214_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its foreign currency forward contracts based on pricing models using current market rates.
837465_18_ITEM15_P214_S1	These contracts are classified under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy (see Note 15 ).
837465_18_ITEM15_P215_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company recorded a net loss of $2,679,000 in other comprehensive income (loss) related to its hedging activities.
837465_18_ITEM15_P215_S1	Of this amount, for the year ended December 31, 2017 , net losses of $187,000 were relieved from other comprehensive income and recognized in cost of goods sold for the underlying intercompany sales that were recognized.
837465_18_ITEM15_P215_S2	There were no ineffective gains or losses recognized during 2017 .
837465_18_ITEM15_P215_S3	During 2015, the Company recognized $1,149,000 in other income (expense) as a result of hedge ineffectiveness, of which $576,000 was reclassified from other comprehensive income for hedges that no longer met the accounting requirements.

837465_18_ITEM15_P215_S5	Based on the current valuation, the Company expects to reclassify net losses of $20,000 from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net earnings during the next 12 months.

837465_18_ITEM15_P216_S0	The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated as qualified hedging instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet exposures (payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies), as well as gains and losses resulting from the translation of the operating results of the Company s international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.
837465_18_ITEM15_P216_S1	These contracts generally mature within 12 months from their inception.
837465_18_ITEM15_P216_S2	At December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the notional amounts of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts used to mitigate the exposures discussed above were approximately $4,821,000 , $14,821,000 and $43,098,000 , respectively.
837465_18_ITEM15_P216_S3	The decrease in foreign currency forward contracts reflects the general timing of when the Company enters into these contracts.
837465_18_ITEM15_P216_S4	The Company estimates the fair values of foreign currency forward contracts based on pricing models using current market rates, and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the statement of operations.
837465_18_ITEM15_P216_S5	The foreign currency contracts are classified under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy (see Note 15 ).

837465_18_ITEM15_P219_S1	Due to the recent growth in the accessories and other product category within Golf Clubs from the formation of the apparel joint venture in Japan as well as the Company's acquisition of OGIO in January 2017, the Company reassessed its operating segments during the first quarter of 2017, consistent with the way management reviews its business operations on an ongoing basis.
837465_18_ITEM15_P219_S2	As a result, and based on the Company's assessment, as of January 1, 2017, the Company added a third operating segment, Gear, Accessories and Other, which includes soft goods products and licensing revenues that were formerly in the accessories and other product category within Golf Clubs.
837465_18_ITEM15_P219_S3	Soft goods products include golf apparel and footwear, golf bags, golf gloves, travel gear, headwear and other golf-related accessories, retail apparel sales from the Company's joint venture in Japan, and OGIO branded products as of January 2017.

837465_18_ITEM15_P224_S0	was primarily due to a benefit of $156,600,000 related to the reversal of the Company's valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets.
837465_18_ITEM15_P224_S1	This reversal was partially offset by the recognition of $15,974,000 in income taxes payable on the Company's U.S. business (see Note 10 ).
