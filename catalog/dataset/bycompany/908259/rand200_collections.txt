908259_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	OXiGENE is a clinical-stage, biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics to treat cancer and eye diseases.
908259_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	The Company s primary focus is the development of product candidates referred to as vascular disrupting agents, or VDAs, that selectively disable and destroy abnormal blood vessels that provide solid tumors a means of growth and survival and also are associated with visual impairment in a number of ophthalmological diseases and conditions.
908259_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	the Company s lead candidate, in human clinical trials, and the drug candidate has generally been observed to be well-tolerated.
908259_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	In February 2011, the Company s board of directors voted unanimously to implement a 1:20 reverse stock split of the Company s common stock, following authorization of the reverse split by a shareholder vote on December 21, 2010.
908259_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	The reverse split became effective on February 22, 2011.
908259_11_ITEM1_P2_S2	All of the share and per share amounts discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been adjusted to reflect the effect of this reverse split.
908259_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	OXiGENE will need to access additional funds to remain a going concern beyond the first quarter of 2011 or, if funds are raised through the Company s at-the-market equity offering sales agreement as described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, beyond the second quarter of 2011.
908259_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	Such funding may not be available to OXiGENE on acceptable terms, or at all.
908259_11_ITEM1_P3_S2	If the Company is unable to access additional funds when needed, it may not be able to continue the development of its product candidates or the Company could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of its development programs and other operations.
908259_11_ITEM1_P3_S3	Any additional equity financing, which may not be available to the Company or may not be available on favorable terms, most likely will be dilutive to its current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	If the Company accesses funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, it may be required to relinquish rights to some of its technologies or product candidates that it would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on its own, on terms that are not favorable to the Company.
908259_11_ITEM1_P4_S1	The Company s ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, will materially harm its business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_11_ITEM1_P4_S2	These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
908259_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Report of Independent Registered Accounting Firm at the beginning of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of this Form 10-K includes a going concern explanatory paragraph.
908259_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	OXiGENE is currently pursuing the development of ZYBRESTAT, a reversible tubulin binding agent that works by disrupting the network of blood vessels, or vasculature, within tumors, also referred to as vascular disruption.
908259_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	ZYBRESTAT selectively targets the existing abnormal vasculature found specifically in most solid tumors and causes endothelial cells in that vasculature to become round and block the flow of blood to the tumor.
908259_11_ITEM1_P6_S2	The downstream tumor environment is then deprived of oxygen, and the resulting restriction in blood supply kills the cells in the central portion of the tumor.
908259_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	Based on ZYBRESTAT s positive activity observed in animal models, OXiGENE has conducted multiple clinical trials of ZYBRESTAT in a variety of tumor types.
908259_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	Currently, OXiGENE is pursuing clinical trials of ZYBRESTAT in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ovarian cancer.
908259_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	more than 13 years, in patients with ATC.
908259_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	A subsequent Phase 2 study in 26 ATC patients showed a 23% rate of one year survival in a disease where median expected survival of patients is approximately 3-4 months from the time of diagnosis and fewer than 10% of patients are typically alive at one year.
908259_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	Based on this encouraging data, OXiGENE completed a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, process with the FDA in 2007, for a Phase 2/3 study, which we refer to as the FACT trial, in which ZYBRESTAT was to be evaluated in 180 patients as a potential treatment for ATC.
908259_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	ATC is a highly aggressive and lethal malignancy for which there are currently no approved therapeutics and extremely limited treatment options.
908259_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	ZYBRESTAT was awarded orphan drug status by the FDA and the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of advanced ATC and for the treatment of medullary, Stage IV papillary and Stage IV follicular thyroid cancers.
908259_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	The FDA also granted Fast Track designation to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of regionally advanced and/or metastatic ATC.
908259_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	The primary endpoint for the FACT trial is overall survival.
908259_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	Eligible patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed ATC were randomized either to the treatment arm of the study, in which they received ZYBRESTAT in combination with the chemotherapeutic agents carboplatin and paclitaxel, or to the control arm of the study, in which they received only carboplatin and paclitaxel.
908259_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	Central pathology review by external pathologists not associated with the study was utilized to confirm the histological diagnosis.
908259_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	The FACT trial began enrolling patients in 2007.
908259_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	A total of 40 clinical sites in 11 countries participated in this clinical study, which was conducted in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines and the SPA.
908259_11_ITEM1_P14_S2	Due to the rarity of the disease and the fact that most of the patients screened for the study either died or no longer met the trial s inclusion criteria, the enrollment period spanned more than twice the planned 18 month period.
908259_11_ITEM1_P14_S3	As a result of both the length of the enrollment period and financial constraints affecting the Company, in February 2010, OXiGENE chose to continue to treat and follow all 80 patients who were enrolled in the Phase 2/3 FACT clinical trial in ATC in accordance with the SPA, but to stop further enrollment.
908259_11_ITEM1_P14_S4	Initial data from this trial was presented at both the 14th International Thyroid Congress on September 12, 2010 in Paris, France and the 35th European Society of Medical Oncology Congress on October 11, 2010 in Milan, Italy.
908259_11_ITEM1_P14_S5	At these meetings, OXiGENE reported data suggesting a one-month benefit in overall survival in patients receiving ZYBRESTAT in combination with chemotherapy.
908259_11_ITEM1_P14_S6	Of particular note was the fact that the one year survival rate was more than doubled from 9% to 23% for patients receiving chemotherapy plus ZYBRESTAT.
908259_11_ITEM1_P14_S7	The additional data OXiGENE presented in October also included some pre-defined subgroup analyses that confirmed the overall survival benefit initially observed, and also indicated that ZYBRESTAT improved the survival of patients with the most advanced stages of the disease, as well as patients who had been heavily pretreated with surgery, radiation or chemotherapy.
908259_11_ITEM1_P14_S8	Data from an additional event-driven survival analysis among the 80 enrolled patients are anticipated in the first half of 2011.
908259_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	The FDA has been informed that enrollment in this study was halted at 80 patients and that we expected that the SPA would no longer be applicable.
908259_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	The orphan drug status and the expedited review designations have not been affected by the halted enrollment in the Phase 2/3 study.
908259_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	The Company requested a meeting with the FDA to discuss the results of this study and a potential path forward.
908259_11_ITEM1_P15_S3	In February 2011 the FDA notified the Company that it would meet with the Company on March 16, 2011.
908259_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	OXiGENE is currently evaluating ZYBRESTAT in a 63-patient, randomized, controlled Phase 2 clinical trial, which the Company refers to as the FALCON trial, as a potential first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC.
908259_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	In the FALCON trial, patients are randomized either to the treatment arm of the study, in which they receive ZYBRESTAT (CA4P) in combination with the chemotherapeutic agents, carboplatin and paclitaxel, and bevacizumab, a drug that interferes with blood vessel growth, or angiogenics, or to the control arm of the study, in which they receive a standard combination regimen of carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab.
908259_11_ITEM1_P16_S2	OXiGENE believes that this study will suggest a benefit of ZYBRESTAT in NSCLC therapy.
908259_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	ZYBRESTAT in combination with commonly used anti-angiogenic therapeutics that act by selectively inhibiting a particular blood vessel growth path, namely, the vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, pathway.
908259_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	The Company presented an update of the safety and clinical activity data for this trial at the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer symposium in November 2010 in Berlin, Germany.
908259_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	The updated interim data showed that the median time to progression for patients receiving ZYBRESTAT plus bevacizumab and chemotherapy was 9.5 months, compared with a median time to progression of 8.8 months for patients receiving bevacizumab and chemotherapy alone.
908259_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	Of the patients in the study arm (ZYBRESTAT combined with bevacizumab and carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy), 50% achieved a partial response, compared with the control arm (bevacizumab and chemotherapy) of the trial, where only 38% of patients achieved a partial response.
908259_11_ITEM1_P18_S3	The combination regimen including ZYBRESTAT was observed to be well-tolerated with no significant cumulative toxicities when compared with the control arm of the study.
908259_11_ITEM1_P18_S4	OXiGENE expects to present the overall survival data from this study at the ASCO meeting in June 2011.
908259_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	On June 1, 2009, OXiGENE reported positive final data from an investigator-sponsored Phase 2 study of ZYBRESTAT and carboplatin plus paclitaxel chemotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer at the 2009 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).
908259_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	Of 44 patients enrolled in the study, 11 (25%) had confirmed partial responses as determined by the Gynecologic Cancer Inter Group (GCIG) response criteria, i.e., response by tumor imaging (RECIST) and/or ovarian cancer biomarker (CA-125) criteria.
908259_11_ITEM1_P19_S2	An additional 4 patients had unconfirmed partial responses, and stable disease responses were reported in an additional 16 patients.
908259_11_ITEM1_P19_S3	The combination regimen of ZYBRESTAT and carboplatin plus paclitaxel chemotherapy was observed to be well-tolerated with approximately half of the patients completing all 6 cycles of therapy.
908259_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	Based on the results of this Phase 2, single-arm, two-stage study, in February 2011 OXiGENE announced that it has entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the National Cancer Institute s (NCI) Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) to collaborate on the conduct of a randomized Phase 2 trial of ZYBRESTAT in combination with bevacizumab in up to 110 patients with relapsed, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.
908259_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	Under the terms of the agreement, OXiGENE will provide ZYBRESTAT to NCI for an NCI-sponsored study conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG), an organization dedicated to clinical research in the field of gynecologic cancer.
908259_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	The aim of the trial will be to determine if the combination of ZYBRESTAT and bevacizumab will enhance anti-tumor effects and further delay tumor progression when compared to bevacizumab alone.
908259_11_ITEM1_P20_S3	OXiGENE anticipates that investigators will initiate enrollment in this Phase 2 study in the first half of 2011.
908259_11_ITEM1_P20_S4	The primary endpoint of the study will be progression-free survival, with results expected to become available in early 2013.
908259_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	OXiGENE believes that, if successful, the ongoing ZYBRESTAT for oncology clinical trial program will establish a compelling rationale for further development of ZYBRESTAT as a treatment for:
908259_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	use in combination with commonly used drugs, such as bevacizumab, that interfere with blood vessel growth, or angiogenics, in various solid tumor indications.
908259_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	The Company believes these areas for potential further development collectively represent a significant unmet medical need and thus a significant potential commercial market opportunity that includes cancers of the thyroid, ovary, kidney, liver, head and neck, breast, lung, skin, brain, colon and rectum.
908259_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	OXiGENE is currently pursuing development of OXi4503, a second-generation, dual-mechanism VDA, as a treatment for certain solid tumor types and, as a more recent development, for the treatment of myeloid leukemias.
908259_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	We believe that OXi4503 is differentiated from other VDAs by its dual-action activity: in addition to having potent vascular disrupting effects, OXi4503 is unique in that certain enzymes in the human body can help convert it to a form of chemical that has direct tumor cell killing effects.
908259_11_ITEM1_P24_S2	OXiGENE believes this unique property may result in enhanced anti-tumor activity in certain tumor types as compared with other VDA drug candidates.
908259_11_ITEM1_P24_S3	Based on data from preclinical studies, the Company believes that OXi4503 may have enhanced activity in tumor types with relatively high levels of the enzymes that facilitate the conversion of OXi4503 to the form of chemical that kills tumor cells.
908259_11_ITEM1_P24_S4	These tumor types include hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, and leukemias of the myeloid lineage.
908259_11_ITEM1_P24_S5	In preclinical studies, OXi4503 has shown potent anti-tumor activity against solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia models, both as a single agent and in combination with other cancer treatment modalities.
908259_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	OXiGENE has completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of OXi4503 in patients with advanced solid tumors sponsored by Clinical Research United Kingdom.
908259_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	In collaboration with OXiGENE, Professor Gordon Rustin and colleagues from the Mount Vernon Cancer Research Centre, UK and other institutions in the United Kingdom, reported positive final data from this study at the 2010 ASCO Annual Meeting.
908259_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	In this study, 45 patients with advanced solid tumors who had declined or were unresponsive to standard treatment were treated with escalating doses of OXi4503.
908259_11_ITEM1_P25_S3	Partial responses were observed in two patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and stable disease was observed in 9 patients.
908259_11_ITEM1_P25_S4	OXi4503 was also observed to be well-tolerated in this study.
908259_11_ITEM1_P25_S5	To date, OXi4503 has been observed to have a manageable side-effect profile similar to that of other agents in the VDA class, potential single-agent clinical activity, and effects on tumor blood flow and tumor metabolic activity, as determined with several imaging modalities.
908259_11_ITEM1_P25_S6	The Company also evaluated escalating doses of OXi4503 in an ongoing OXiGENE-sponsored Phase 1b trial, initiated in the first quarter of 2009 in patients with solid tumors with hepatic involvement.
908259_11_ITEM1_P25_S7	This study confirmed the recommended dose established in the first Phase 1 study.
908259_11_ITEM1_P25_S8	Patient follow-up and final analysis of the data from the latter trial is ongoing.
908259_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Based on the results of preclinical studies published in the journal Blood in September 2010 that show OXi4503 has potent activity against AML in animal models, OXiGENE expects that investigators at the University of Florida will initiate an investigator sponsored Phase 1 study of OXi4503 in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in the first half of 2011.
908259_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	The Company expects this open-label, dose-escalating study for the treatment of up to 36 patients to be conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory AML and MDS and will evaluate the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose and biologic activity of OXi4503 in these patients.
908259_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	The Company expects that initial indications of biologic activity from this study may be available as early as the first half of 2012.
908259_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	The general direction of future development of OXi4503 solid tumors or hematologic indications will depend on the outcome of the analysis of both the solid tumor studies and the study in AML, as well as available financial resources and potential partnering activities.
908259_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	In addition to developing ZYBRESTAT as an intravenously administered therapy for oncology indications, OXiGENE has undertaken an ophthalmology research and development program with ZYBRESTAT with the ultimate goal of developing a topical formulation of ZYBRESTAT for ophthalmological diseases and conditions that are characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth within the eye that result in loss of vision.
908259_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	Previously, OXiGENE reported results at the 2007 annual meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, or ARVO, from a Phase 2 study in patients with myopic macular degeneration in which all patients in the study met the primary clinical endpoint of vision stabilization at three months after study entry.
908259_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	intravenously-administered ZYBRESTAT in patients with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), a form of choroidal neovascularization, which is a condition where new blood vessels form in the choroid, a part of the eye, and which can lead to vision loss and, ultimately, blindness.
908259_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	Current therapies, including approved drugs that interfere with blood vessel growth, known as anti-angiogenics, appear to provide limited benefit.
908259_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	OXiGENE believes that the architecture of the abnormal vasculature in certain eye tissues, namely the retina and choroid, which contribute to PCV patients loss of vision, may be particularly susceptible to treatment with a VDA such as ZYBRESTAT.
908259_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Company believes that PCV represents an attractive target indication and development pathway for ZYBRESTAT.
908259_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	Unlike wet age-related macular degeneration, an indication for which several anti-angiogenic drugs are approved or prescribed off-label, conducting clinical studies of ZYBRESTAT in patients with ophthalmologic indications not yet approved for treatment with such anti-angiogenic drugs could potentially prove to reduce development time and expense.
908259_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	The objectives of the FAVOR trial and the ongoing preclinical program of ZYBRESTAT in ophthalmology are:
908259_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	further evaluate the feasibility of developing a topical formulation of ZYBRESTAT for ophthalmological indications.
908259_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	Findings from the Phase 2 study, including effects on retinal thickness and retinal bleeding, are expected to be presented at a future ophthalmology meeting.
908259_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	The Company believes that a safe, effective and convenient topically-administered anti-vascular therapeutic would have advantages over currently approved anti-vascular, ophthalmological therapeutics, many of which must be injected directly into patients eyes, in some cases on a chronic monthly basis.
908259_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	For this purpose OXiGENE has been developing a potential minitab topical formulation of ZYBRESTAT which has demonstrated attractive pharmacokinetic and safety properties and efficacy in destroying abnormal vasculature in a rat choroidal melanoma model following administration in the eye.
908259_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	The Company believes that a topical formulation would enhance our partnering opportunities to further develop ZYBRESTAT in diseases of the eye.
908259_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	To date, OXiGENE has completed preclinical testing that indicated that ZYBRESTAT has activity in six different preclinical ophthalmology models, including a model in which ZYBRESTAT was combined with an approved drug that interferes with blood vessel growth, or anti-angiogenic agents.
908259_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	The Company has also completed multiple preclinical studies suggesting that ZYBRESTAT, when applied topically to the surface of the eye at doses that appear to be well-tolerated, penetrates to the retina and choroid in quantities that it believes should be sufficient for therapeutic activity.
908259_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	OXiGENE is also evaluating the requirements for additional preclinical toxicology and efficacy studies with ZYBRESTAT for topical ophthalmological formulations to better position the program for partnering.
908259_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	Further development of this program will depend on the outcome of our evaluation of these requirements and available financial resources.
908259_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	The following table outlines the ongoing, recently completed and planned clinical development programs for OXiGENE s current product candidates:
908259_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	We are a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 1988 in the state of New York and reincorporated in 1992 in the state of Delaware, with our principal corporate office in the United States at 701 Gateway Boulevard, Suite 210, South San Francisco, California 94080 (telephone: (650) 635-7000, fax: (650) 635-7001).
908259_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	We also have an office at 300 Bear Hill Road, Waltham, Massachusetts 02451.
908259_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	section of our web site as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
908259_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	Information contained on our web site does not form a part of this Annual Report.
908259_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	According to Cancer Research UK, a cancer organization in the United Kingdom, nearly 90% of all cancers, more than 200 types, are solid tumors, which are dependent upon a continually developing vascular supply for their growth and survival.
908259_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	Similarly, in the ophthalmology field, abnormal neovascularization characterizes a variety of ophthalmological diseases and conditions, including corneal neovascularization, central retinal vein occlusion, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, sickle cell retinopathy, myopic macular degeneration (MMD), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and neovascular glaucoma.
908259_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	Since 2004, multiple drugs that interfere with blood vessel growth, or anti-angiogenics (see table below) have been approved for a variety of cancer and ophthalmology indications, and development of approved anti-angiogenic drugs for new indications continues.
908259_11_ITEM1_P43_S1	Physician adoption of these first-generation anti-vascular drugs has been rapid and continues to accelerate.
908259_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	OXiGENE believes that its VDA drug candidates are second-generation anti-vascular drugs that differ from and are complementary and non-competitive with anti-angiogenic agents.
908259_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	Similar to anti-angiogenic agents, OXiGENE s VDA drug candidates are anti-vascular drugs that exert therapeutic effects by depriving tumors and in the case of eye disease, ocular lesions of blood supply.
908259_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	OXiGENE also believes that its VDA therapeutics may be better tolerated than anti-angiogenic drugs and may potentially have utility in later-stage tumors that have become unresponsive to anti-angiogenic therapies.
908259_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	In September 2006, OXiGENE announced the publication of a research article in the journal Science that provided strong scientific evidence for combining VDAs with anti-angiogenic agents such as bevacizumab, a widely-used anti-angiogenic drug that acts by inhibiting VEGF, a pro-angiogenic growth factor.
908259_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	In this article, Professor Kerbel and Dr. Shaked from Sunnybrook Cancer Centre in Canada demonstrated that the combination of ZYBRESTAT and an anti-angiogenic agent (an anti-VEGF-receptor antibody) had synergistic effects on tumors.
908259_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	In December 2007, OXiGENE completed a Phase Ib clinical trial to evaluate ZYBRESTAT in combination with bevacizumab (an approved and widely-used anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody) in patients with advanced solid tumors.
908259_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	This was the first human clinical trial to pair a vascular disrupting agent and an anti-angiogenic drug in the treatment of cancer, specifically in patients who had failed previous treatments and were in advanced stages of disease.
908259_11_ITEM1_P47_S2	The trial was an open-label, multi-center trial designed to determine the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of ZYBRESTAT administered intravenously in combination with bevacizumab.
908259_11_ITEM1_P47_S3	Three dose levels of ZYBRESTAT were evaluated in combination with an approved dose of bevacizumab.
908259_11_ITEM1_P47_S4	In May of 2008, OXiGENE reported final data from the trial showing that the two-drug combination appeared to be well-tolerated with early signs of clinical efficacy (9 of 16 patients with stable disease responses with prolonged stable disease observed in several patients) and additive effects on tumor blood-flow inhibition.
908259_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	OXiGENE believes that these pre-clinical and clinical research results suggest combining VDA and anti-angiogenic therapies may be a compelling strategy to maximize the therapeutic potential of VDAs and anti-angiogenic drugs in the treatment of solid tumors.
908259_11_ITEM1_P48_S1	OXiGENE believes the potential ability to synergistically combine VDA drugs with anti-angiogenic therapeutics affords it a wide range of future development and commercialization options with its VDA drug candidates, including tumor types and treatment settings where anti-angiogenic drugs are commonly utilized, as well as those where anti-angiogenic agents are either poorly tolerated, ineffective, no longer effective, or not commonly utilized.
908259_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	As illustrated in the table below, VDA and anti-angiogenic drugs act via different mechanisms to produce complementary biological and anti-vascular effects with mostly non-overlapping side effects.
908259_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	studies, VDA plus anti-angiogenic drug combinations demonstrate robust and additive anti-tumor effects.
908259_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	Results from initial human clinical studies conducted by OXiGENE with combinations of ZYBRESTAT and the widely-used anti-angiogenic drug, bevacizumab, provide support and initial clinical validation for combining these agents to significantly increase clinical activity without significantly increasing side-effects.
908259_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	Vascular and non-vascular side-effects, some of which are chronic in nature, e.g., chronic hypertension, wound-healing impairment, hemorrhage/ hemoptysis, gastrointestinal perforation, proteinuria/nephrotic syndrome, thromboembolic events, etc.
908259_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	OXiGENE believes its VDA drug candidates act on tumor blood vessels via two complementary mechanisms, tubulin depolymerization and disengagement of the junctional protein VE-cadherin, which cause shape change of tumor vascular endothelial cells, vessel occlusion and collapse, and the subsequent blockage of blood-flow to the tumor, which deprives it of oxygen and nutrients essential for survival.
908259_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	In vitro studies have demonstrated that OXiGENE s VDA drug candidates act in a reversible fashion on a protein called tubulin inside newly-formed and growing endothelial cells, such as the vascular endothelial cells comprising tumor vasculature.
908259_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	By binding to the tubulin, ZYBRESTAT is able to collapse the structural framework that maintains the cells flat shape.
908259_11_ITEM1_P53_S2	When this occurs, the shape of the cells changes from flat to round, initiating a cascade of events resulting in physical blockage of the blood vessels.
908259_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	growth and also prevents tumor cells from being able to excrete toxic metabolic waste products.
908259_11_ITEM1_P54_S1	The consequence of the blockage is extensive tumor cell death, as demonstrated in animal studies and suggested in imaging studies of human patients treated with ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503.
908259_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	Pre-clinical research, published in the November 2005 issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation , showed that ZYBRESTAT also disrupts the molecular engagement of VE-cadherin, a junctional protein important for endothelial cell survival and function.
908259_11_ITEM1_P55_S1	The authors of the research article conclude that this effect only occurs in endothelial cells which lack contact with smooth muscle cells, a known feature of abnormal vasculature associated with tumors and other disease processes.
908259_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	The disengagement of VE-cadherin leads to endothelial cell detachment, which in turn, can cause permanent physical blockage of vessels.
908259_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	Pre-clinical and clinical study results indicate that ZYBRESTAT exerts anti-vascular effects rapidly, within hours of administration, and the half-life of the active form of ZYBRESTAT in humans is approximately four hours.
908259_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	Because the half-life of the active form of ZYBRESTAT is relatively short, the effects of ZYBRESTAT on tubulin are reversible, and ZYBRESTAT is typically administered no more frequently than once per week, the side-effects of ZYBRESTAT are typically transient in nature, limited to the period of time following administration when the active form of ZYBRESTAT is in the body in significant concentrations.
908259_11_ITEM1_P57_S2	This contrasts with drugs that interfere with blood vessel growth, known as anti-angiogenic agents, which are typically administered on a chronic basis so as to constantly maintain levels of drug in the body, exert their tumor blood-vessel growth inhibiting effects over days to weeks, and as a result can cause a variety of chronic side-effects that are not limited to the immediate period following administration.
908259_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	In contrast with anti-angiogenic agents, which can cause a variety of chronic side-effects, side-effects associated with ZYBRESTAT are typically transient and manageable.
908259_11_ITEM1_P58_S1	The most frequent ZYBRESTAT side-effects include infusion-related side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache and fatigue, and tumor pain, which is consistent with the drug s mechanism-of-action.
908259_11_ITEM1_P58_S2	Like approved anti-angiogenic drugs, ZYBRESTAT also exhibits cardiovascular effects, which in the majority of patients are mild and transient in nature.
908259_11_ITEM1_P58_S3	Approximately 10-20% of patients treated with ZYBRESTAT experience clinically-significant and transient hypertension that can be readily managed and prevented after initial occurrence with straightforward oral anti-hypertensive therapy.
908259_11_ITEM1_P58_S4	In an analysis undertaken by OXiGENE, the incidence of serious cardiovascular side-effects such as angina and myocardial ischemia observed across all studies to date (including early studies in which hypertension management and prevention was not employed) was less than 3%, a frequency comparable to that reported with approved anti-angiogenic agents such as bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib.
908259_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	In September 2010, a research article published in the journal Blood demonstrated that, in a systemic model of human leukemia growing in mice, OXi4503 had significant anti-leukemic activity when used as single agent.
908259_11_ITEM1_P59_S1	In this article, Dr Cogle and colleagues from the University of Florida in Gainesville provided evidence that the single agent activity of OXi4503 was greater than that obtained with the anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab.
908259_11_ITEM1_P59_S2	In addition they attributed this anti-leukemic activity to several mechanisms including both its effect on blood vessels and a direct effect on leukemia cells mediated via its oxidation to a reactive quinine moiety and the associated production of oxygen radicals.
908259_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	Under a sponsored research agreement with Baylor University, OXiGENE is pursuing discovery and development of additional novel, small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, including small-molecule cathepsin-L inhibitors and VDAs that are activated by areas of tumors that are deprived of adequate oxygen supply.
908259_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	Cathepsin-L is an enzyme involved in protein degradation and has been shown to be closely involved in the processes of angiogenesis and metastasis.
908259_11_ITEM1_P61_S1	Small molecule inhibitors may have the potential to slow tumor growth and metastasis in a manner OXiGENE believes could be complementary with its VDA therapeutics.
908259_11_ITEM1_P61_S2	OXiGENE also believes that its hypoxia-activated VDAs could serve as line-extension products to ZYBRESTAT and/or OXi4503.
908259_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	OXiGENE s strategy is to develop innovative therapeutics for oncology and to leverage its drug candidates and technology in the field of ophthalmology.
908259_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	The principal focus of OXiGENE, in the foreseeable future, is to advance the clinical development of its drug candidates ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503 and to identify new pre-clinical candidates that are complementary to our VDAs.
908259_11_ITEM1_P62_S2	To advance its strategy, OXiGENE has established relationships with universities, research organizations and other institutions in these fields.
908259_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	OXiGENE intends to further these relationships, rather than expand its in-house research and development staff.
908259_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	In general, these programs are created, developed and controlled by internal OXiGENE management.
908259_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	Currently, OXiGENE has collaborative agreements and arrangements with a number of institutions in the United States and abroad, which it utilizes to perform the day-to-day activities associated with drug development.
908259_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	In 2010, collaborations were ongoing with a variety of university and research institutions, including the following:
908259_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	University College London, London, United Kingdom.

908259_11_ITEM1_P67_S4	Payments made to ASU to date have amounted to $2,500,000.
908259_11_ITEM1_P67_S5	The agreement is to terminate on December 31, 2014 or within two months of receipt of written notice of termination from OXiGENE.
908259_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	OXiGENE also has a license from Baylor University.
908259_11_ITEM1_P68_S1	The Baylor license is an exclusive license to all novel compositions developed for the treatment of vascular disorders, inflammation, parasitic diseases and infections, fungal diseases and infections and/or cancer.
908259_11_ITEM1_P68_S2	OXiGENE has the right to grant sublicenses under the Baylor license.
908259_11_ITEM1_P68_S3	The agreement with Baylor stipulates that low single-digit royalties will be paid by OXiGENE should sales be generated through use of Baylor s compounds, or a minimum annual royalty payment of $20,000.
908259_11_ITEM1_P68_S4	OXiGENE is not required to pay Baylor for use of Baylor s compounds other than pursuant to this royalty arrangement.
908259_11_ITEM1_P68_S5	OXiGENE is entitled to file, prosecute and maintain patent applications on products for which it has a license under this agreement.
908259_11_ITEM1_P68_S6	OXiGENE had made a one-time payment of $50,000 for the licensing fee that was used as a credit against research expenses generated by Baylor.
908259_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	Either party may terminate the license agreement upon material default of the other party.
908259_11_ITEM1_P69_S1	The term of the license shall end upon the expiration of the licensed patents.
908259_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	OXiGENE also has an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) for commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including among others, ZYBRESTAT.
908259_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	Under the BMS license, OXiGENE has the right to grant sublicenses.
908259_11_ITEM1_P70_S2	BMS is entitled to low-single-digit royalty payments under the license agreement.
908259_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	OXiGENE bears the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the BMS license and has a right, but not a duty, of enforcing patents covered by the license.
908259_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	Either party may terminate the license upon material default of the other party.
908259_11_ITEM1_P71_S2	The term of the license shall end upon the expiration of the licensed patents.
908259_11_ITEM1_P71_S3	The latest United States patent licensed under this agreement is scheduled to expire in December 2021.
908259_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	In October 2008, OXiGENE announced a strategic collaboration with Symphony Capital Partners, L.P. (Symphony), a private-equity firm, under which Symphony agreed to provide up to $40,000,000 in funding to support the advancement of ZYBRESTAT for oncology, ZYBRESTAT for ophthalmology and OXi4503.
908259_11_ITEM1_P72_S1	In connection with the collaboration, OXiGENE granted Symphony ViDA, Inc., a newly-created drug development company, exclusive licenses to ZYBRESTAT for use in ophthalmologic indications and OXi4503.
908259_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	Under the collaboration, OXiGENE entered into a series of related agreements with Symphony Capital LLC, Symphony ViDA, Symphony ViDA Holdings LLC (Holdings) and related entities, including a Purchase Option Agreement, a Research and Development Agreement, a Technology License Agreement and an Additional Funding Agreement.
908259_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	In addition, OXiGENE entered into a series of related agreements with Holdings, including a Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement and a Registration Rights Agreement.
908259_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	Pursuant to these agreements, Holdings formed and capitalized Symphony ViDA in order (a) to hold certain intellectual property related to the programs which were exclusively licensed to Symphony ViDA under the Technology License Agreement and (b) to fund commitments of up to $25,000,000.
908259_11_ITEM1_P74_S1	The funding was intended to support preclinical and clinical development by OXiGENE, on behalf of Symphony ViDA, of the programs.
908259_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	OXiGENE issued to Holdings, pursuant to the Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement, an aggregate of 675,675 shares of its common stock and warrants at a price of $22.20 per share, which was the closing price of its common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on September 30, 2008, the day before OXiGENE entered into the Symphony transaction.
908259_11_ITEM1_P75_S1	In addition, pursuant to the Purchase Option Agreement, OXiGENE issued to Holdings an aggregate of 180,180 shares of OXiGENE s common stock with a fair value of $4,000,000 as consideration for the Purchase Option.
908259_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	On July 2, 2009, OXiGENE, Holdings and Symphony ViDA entered into a series of related agreements pursuant to which OXiGENE exercised the Purchase Option under terms set forth in an amended and restated purchase option agreement (the Amended Purchase Option Agreement), and OXiGENE and Holdings also entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement.
908259_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	OXiGENE closed on the amended Purchase Option on July 20, 2009 and issued 500,000 shares of its common stock to Holdings at the closing in exchange for all of the equity of Symphony ViDA, subject to further adjustment under the rights described in the paragraph above.
908259_11_ITEM1_P77_S1	In addition, upon the closing of the Purchase Option, OXiGENE re-acquired all of the rights to the programs, and the approximately $12,400,000 in cash held by Symphony ViDA at the time of the closing became available for use for OXiGENE s general corporate purposes.
908259_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing.
908259_11_ITEM1_P78_S1	Our drugs must be approved by FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States.
908259_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations.
908259_11_ITEM1_P79_S1	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
908259_11_ITEM1_P79_S2	Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions.
908259_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusal of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties.
908259_11_ITEM1_P80_S1	Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
908259_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
908259_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA.
908259_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
908259_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development it enters the pre-clinical testing stage.
908259_11_ITEM1_P84_S1	Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies.
908259_11_ITEM1_P84_S2	An IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND.
908259_11_ITEM1_P84_S3	The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation.
908259_11_ITEM1_P84_S4	Pre-clinical testing continues even after the IND is submitted.
908259_11_ITEM1_P84_S5	The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold.
908259_11_ITEM1_P84_S6	In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.
908259_11_ITEM1_P84_S7	Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
908259_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practice regulations.
908259_11_ITEM1_P85_S1	These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
908259_11_ITEM1_P85_S2	Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution.
908259_11_ITEM1_P85_S3	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
908259_11_ITEM1_P85_S4	The IRB also approves the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the study until completed.
908259_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	Each new clinical protocol must be submitted to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval.
908259_11_ITEM1_P86_S1	Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety.
908259_11_ITEM1_P87_S0	Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
908259_11_ITEM1_P88_S0	Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
908259_11_ITEM1_P88_S1	In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
908259_11_ITEM1_P89_S0	Phase 2: Involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
908259_11_ITEM1_P90_S0	Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites.
908259_11_ITEM1_P90_S1	These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling.
908259_11_ITEM1_P91_S0	During the development of a new drug, sponsors may, under certain circumstances request a special protocol assessment, or SPA, from the FDA.
908259_11_ITEM1_P91_S1	For example, a sponsor may request an SPA of a protocol for a clinical trial that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in an NDA.
908259_11_ITEM1_P91_S2	The request, which must be made prior to commencing the trial, must include the proposed protocol and protocol-specific questions that the sponsor would like the FDA to answer regarding the protocol design, study goals and data analysis for the proposed investigation.
908259_11_ITEM1_P91_S3	After receiving the request, the FDA will consider whether the submission is appropriate for an SPA.
908259_11_ITEM1_P91_S4	If an SPA is appropriate, the FDA will base its assessment on the questions posed by the sponsor.
908259_11_ITEM1_P91_S5	Comments from the FDA review team are supposed to be sent to the sponsor within 45 calendar days of receipt of the request.
908259_11_ITEM1_P91_S6	The sponsor may request a meeting to discuss the comments and any remaining issues and uncertainties regarding the protocol.
908259_11_ITEM1_P91_S7	If the sponsor and the FDA reach agreement regarding the protocol, the agreement will be documented and made part of the administrative record.
908259_11_ITEM1_P91_S8	This agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins, except (1) with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or (2) if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began.
908259_11_ITEM1_P92_S0	Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA.
908259_11_ITEM1_P92_S1	IND Safety Reports must be submitted to the FDA, IRBs and the investigators for (a) any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected; (b) any findings from epidemiological studies, pooled analysis of multiple studies, or clinical studies (other than those already reported in (a); (c) any findings from animal or in vitro testing, whether or not conducted by the sponsor, that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug, such as reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure; and (d) any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
908259_11_ITEM1_P92_S2	Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
908259_11_ITEM1_P92_S3	The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
908259_11_ITEM1_P92_S4	Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
908259_11_ITEM1_P93_S0	Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
908259_11_ITEM1_P93_S1	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug.
908259_11_ITEM1_P93_S2	Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
908259_11_ITEM1_P94_S0	The results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product.
908259_11_ITEM1_P94_S1	The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
908259_11_ITEM1_P95_S0	In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective.
908259_11_ITEM1_P95_S1	The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
908259_11_ITEM1_P95_S2	Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
908259_11_ITEM1_P96_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing.
908259_11_ITEM1_P96_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing.
908259_11_ITEM1_P96_S2	In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information.
908259_11_ITEM1_P96_S3	The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
908259_11_ITEM1_P97_S0	Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
908259_11_ITEM1_P97_S1	FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
908259_11_ITEM1_P97_S2	The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
908259_11_ITEM1_P97_S3	The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information.
908259_11_ITEM1_P97_S4	Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
908259_11_ITEM1_P97_S5	Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
908259_11_ITEM1_P97_S6	The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA.
908259_11_ITEM1_P98_S0	The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product s identity, strength, quality and purity.
908259_11_ITEM1_P99_S0	Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.
908259_11_ITEM1_P99_S1	The FDA will also inspect selected clinical sites that participated in the clinical studies and may inspect the testing facilities that performed the GLP toxicology studies cited in the NDA.
908259_11_ITEM1_P100_S0	NDAs receive either standard or priority review.
908259_11_ITEM1_P100_S1	A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review.
908259_11_ITEM1_P100_S2	In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
908259_11_ITEM1_P100_S3	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials.
908259_11_ITEM1_P100_S4	Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process.
908259_11_ITEM1_P101_S0	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
908259_11_ITEM1_P101_S1	In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct Phase IV testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized.
908259_11_ITEM1_P102_S0	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug.
908259_11_ITEM1_P102_S1	Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA.
908259_11_ITEM1_P102_S2	After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
908259_11_ITEM1_P102_S3	Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
908259_11_ITEM1_P103_S0	If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years.
908259_11_ITEM1_P103_S1	Orphan drug exclusivity, however, also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor s product for the same indication or disease.
908259_11_ITEM1_P104_S0	In the European Union and Japan, orphan drug exclusivity regulations provide for 10 years of marketing exclusivity for orphan drugs that are approved for the treatment of rare diseases or conditions.
908259_11_ITEM1_P105_S0	ZYBRESTAT was awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of anaplastic, medullary, Stage IV papillary and Stage IV follicular thyroid cancers and by the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer.
908259_11_ITEM1_P106_S0	The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints.
908259_11_ITEM1_P106_S1	Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, we cannot be sure that the FDA will not later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened.
908259_11_ITEM1_P106_S2	Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments.
908259_11_ITEM1_P107_S0	Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied.
908259_11_ITEM1_P107_S1	Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review.
908259_11_ITEM1_P108_S0	Drugs that receive an accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect of a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
908259_11_ITEM1_P108_S1	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials.
908259_11_ITEM1_P109_S0	The FDA has granted Fast Track designation to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of regionally advanced and/or metastatic ATC.
908259_11_ITEM1_P110_S0	Before our products can be marketed outside of the United States, they are subject to regulatory approval similar to that required in the United States, although the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, including additional clinical trials that may be required, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country.
908259_11_ITEM1_P110_S1	No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country.
908259_11_ITEM1_P111_S0	The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval.
908259_11_ITEM1_P111_S1	In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved.
908259_11_ITEM1_P111_S2	The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted.
908259_11_ITEM1_P111_S3	Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices may not be approved for such product.
908259_11_ITEM1_P112_S0	In Europe, marketing authorizations may be submitted at a centralized, a decentralized or national level.
908259_11_ITEM1_P112_S1	The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all European Union members states.
908259_11_ITEM1_P112_S2	As of January 1995, a mutual recognition procedure is available at the request of the applicant for all medicinal products that are not subject to the centralized procedure.
908259_11_ITEM1_P112_S3	There can be no assurance that the chosen regulatory strategy will secure regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all.
908259_11_ITEM1_P113_S0	OXiGENE actively seeks to protect the proprietary technology that it considers important to its business, including chemical species, compositions and forms, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, as well as modified forms of naturally-expressed receptors, in the United States and other jurisdictions internationally that it considers key pharmaceutical markets.
908259_11_ITEM1_P113_S1	OXiGENE also relies upon trade secrets and contracts to protect its proprietary information.
908259_11_ITEM1_P114_S0	As of March 9, 2011, we were the exclusive licensee, sole assignee or co-assignee of twenty-nine (29) granted United States patents, seventeen (17) pending United States patent applications, two (2) pending Patent Cooperation Treaty international patent applications, and granted patents and/or pending applications in several other major markets, including the European Union, Canada and Japan.
908259_11_ITEM1_P115_S0	OXiGENE s policy is to file United States and foreign patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of its business.
908259_11_ITEM1_P115_S1	There can be no assurance that any of these patent applications will result in the grant of a patent either in the United States or elsewhere, or that any patents granted will be valid and enforceable, or will provide a competitive advantage or will afford protection against competitors with similar technologies.
908259_11_ITEM1_P115_S2	OXiGENE also intends to rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel drugs.
908259_11_ITEM1_P115_S3	OXiGENE seeks protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements.
908259_11_ITEM1_P116_S0	OXiGENE considers the following United States patents owned by or exclusively licensed to OXiGENE to be particularly important to the protection of its most advanced product candidates.
908259_11_ITEM1_P117_S0	In addition to these patents, for some of OXiGENE s product candidates, it has patents and/or applications that cover a particular form or composition, used as part of combination therapy or method of preparation or use, as well as other pending patent applications.
908259_11_ITEM1_P117_S1	These issued patents, including any patents that issue from pending applications, could provide additional or a longer period of protection.
908259_11_ITEM1_P117_S2	OXiGENE also has patent applications pending that seek equivalent or substantially comparable protection for its product candidates in jurisdictions internationally that it considers key pharmaceutical markets.
908259_11_ITEM1_P118_S0	The patent expiration dates referenced above do not reflect any potential patent term extension that OXiGENE may receive under the federal Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
908259_11_ITEM1_P118_S1	The Hatch-Waxman Act generally permits a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
908259_11_ITEM1_P118_S2	Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years.
908259_11_ITEM1_P119_S0	The patent term restoration period is generally one-half of the time between the effective date of an investigational new drug application, or IND, and the submission date of a new drug application, or NDA, plus the time between the submission date and approval date of an NDA.
908259_11_ITEM1_P119_S1	Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent.
908259_11_ITEM1_P120_S0	The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for patent term extension.
908259_11_ITEM1_P121_S0	The industry in which OXiGENE is engaged is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition.
908259_11_ITEM1_P121_S1	OXiGENE s competitors include, among others, major pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, many of which have financial, technical and marketing resources significantly greater than those of OXiGENE.
908259_11_ITEM1_P121_S2	In addition, many of the small companies that compete with OXiGENE have also formed collaborative relationships with large, established companies to support research, development, clinical trials and commercialization of products that may be competitive with those of OXiGENE.
908259_11_ITEM1_P121_S3	Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or through joint ventures or other collaborations.
908259_11_ITEM1_P122_S0	OXiGENE is aware of a limited number of companies involved in the development of VDAs.
908259_11_ITEM1_P122_S1	Such companies include Sanofi-Aventis, Myrexis, Nereus and MediciNova, all of which have VDAs that management believes are at an earlier or similar stage of clinical development than OXiGENE s lead drug candidate, ZYBRESTAT.
908259_11_ITEM1_P123_S0	OXiGENE expects that, if any of its products gain regulatory approval for sale, they will compete primarily on the basis of product efficacy, safety, patient convenience, reliability, price and patent protection.
908259_11_ITEM1_P123_S1	OXiGENE s competitive position will also depend on its ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop effective proprietary products and implement joint ventures or other alliances with large pharmaceutical companies in order to jointly market and manufacture its products.
908259_11_ITEM1_P124_S0	OXiGENE expects to continue to maintain a relatively small number of executives and other employees.
908259_11_ITEM1_P125_S0	OXiGENE relies on outsourcing much of its research, development, pre-clinical testing and clinical trial activity, although it maintains managerial and quality control over its clinical trials.
908259_11_ITEM1_P125_S1	As of December 31, 2010, OXiGENE had a total of 22 employees, of which 13 were engaged in research and development and monitoring of clinical trials.
908259_11_ITEM1_P126_S0	OXiGENE s Clinical Trial Advisory Board assesses and evaluates OXiGENE s clinical trial program.
908259_11_ITEM1_P126_S1	The Scientific Advisory Board discusses and evaluates OXiGENE s research and development projects.
908259_11_ITEM1_P126_S2	Members of the Clinical Trial Advisory Board and the Scientific Advisory Board are independent and have no involvement with OXiGENE other than serving on such boards.
908259_11_ITEM1_P126_S3	From time to time, however, the institutions or organizations these individuals are associated with may provide OXiGENE with services.
908259_11_ITEM1_P127_S0	The members of OXiGENE s Clinical Trial Advisory Board are:
908259_11_ITEM1_P128_S0	HILARY CALVERT, MB, is the Clinical Director of the Northern Institute for Cancer Research and Professor of Medical Oncology at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, England.

908259_11_ITEM1_P139_S0	Some members of the Scientific Advisory Board and the Clinical Trial Advisory Board receive cash compensation.
908259_11_ITEM1_P139_S1	Others have from time to time received, and are expected to continue to receive, options to purchase shares of common stock of OXiGENE.
908259_11_ITEM1_P139_S2	All members are reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with serving on such boards.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Statements in this Annual Report under the captions Business and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as oral statements that may be made by the Company or by officers, directors or employees of the Company acting on the Company s behalf, that are not historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results of the Company to be materially different from the historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors set forth below.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The Company does not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We will be required to raise additional funds to finance our operations and remain a going concern; we may not be able to do so when necessary, and/or the terms of any financings may not be advantageous to us.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Negative cash flows from our operations are expected to continue over at least the next several years.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our cash utilization amount is highly dependent on the progress of our product development programs, particularly, the results of our preclinical and clinical studies, the cost timing and outcomes of regulatory approval for our product candidates, the terms and conditions of our contracts with service providers for these programs, and the rate of recruitment of patients in our human clinical trials.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In addition, the further development of our ongoing clinical trials will depend on upcoming analysis and results of those studies and our cash resources at that time.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We expect cash on hand, plus anticipated proceeds of our at-the-market equity offering sales agreement to fund our operations through the second quarter of 2011.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	No assurance can be given that we will sell any additional shares under the sales agreement, or, if we do, as to the price or amount of shares that we will sell, or the dates on which any such sales will take place.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	quarter of 2011, we will require significant funding.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Additional funds to finance our operations may not be available on terms that we deem acceptable, or at all.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our ongoing capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including: the progress and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates under development, including ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503; the progress of our research and development programs; the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals; the resources, if any, that we devote to develop manufacturing methods and advanced technologies; our ability to enter into licensing arrangements, including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs; the costs and expenses of filing, prosecuting and, if necessary, enforcing our patent claims, or defending against possible claims of infringement by third-party patent or other technology rights; the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, if any, undertaken by us; and, if and when approved, the demand for our products, which demand depends in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known, understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval, including the range of indications for which any product is granted approval.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we will not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we will be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs or cease operations.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	If we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish, on terms that are not favorable to us, rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our failure to raise capital when needed will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Report of Independent Registered Accounting Firm at the beginning of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of this Form 10-K includes a going concern explanatory paragraph.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We have a history of losses, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We have experienced net losses every year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2010, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $207,700,000.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We anticipate continuing to incur substantial additional losses over at least the next several years due to, among other factors, the need to expend substantial amounts on our continuing clinical trials with respect to our VDA drug candidates, technologies, and anticipated research and development activities and the general and administrative expenses associated with those activities.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We have not commercially introduced any product and our potential products are in varying early stages of development and testing.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Our ability to attain profitability will depend upon our ability to develop products that are effective and commercially viable, to obtain regulatory approval for the manufacture and sale of our products and to license or otherwise market our products successfully.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P12_S4	We may never achieve profitability, and even if we do, we may not be able to sustain being profitable.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We face the potential delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Capital Market due to the uncertainty of our ability to maintain compliance with certain continued listing requirements.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If we are unable to meet these requirements, we could be required to list our common stock in the over-the-counter market, which could make obtaining future financing more difficult.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Prior to March 3, 2011, the Company s stock was listed on the NASDAQ Global Market.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Companies listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market ( NASDAQ ) are subject to delisting for, among other things, failure to maintain a minimum closing bid price per share of $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	On June 17, 2010, we received a letter from NASDAQ indicating that for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price of our common shares closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) for continued inclusion on The NASDAQ Global Market.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we had an initial grace period of 180 calendar days, or until December 14, 2010, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	On July 21, 2010, we received a letter from NASDAQ indicating that for the last 30 consecutive business days, the market value of our common shares did not meet the $50,000,000 minimum market value requirement pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(b)(A) for continued inclusion on The NASDAQ Global Market.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), we had an initial grace period of 180 calendar days, or until January 18, 2011, to regain compliance with the minimum market value requirement.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We did not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement and the minimum market value requirement by December 14, 2010 and January 18, 2011, respectively.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	On March 1, 2011, a NASDAQ Stock Market Hearings Panel advised us of its decision to transfer the listing of our common stock from The NASDAQ Global Market to The NASDAQ Capital Market and continue our listing on that market, provided that we regain compliance by June 13, 2011 with all continued listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market and have evidenced a closing bid price of $1.00 or more for a minimum of ten prior consecutive trading days.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	This compliance deadline represents the full extent of the NASDAQ Stock Market Hearing Panel s authority to grant an exception and allow the continued listing of our common stock while we remain deficient with respect to the continued listing standards.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Should we be unable to timely regain compliance with NASDAQ s continued listing standards, the Hearings Panel indicated it will issue a final determination to delist our common stock and suspend trading of our common stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market, to be effective on the second business day from the date of the final determination.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We cannot be sure that we will be able to regain compliance with The NASDAQ Stock Market s listing standards by June 13, 2011.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Neither can we be sure that our share price or market value will comply with the requirements for continued listing of our common shares on The NASDAQ Capital Market in the future.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P17_S5	If our common shares lose their status on The NASDAQ Capital Market, our common shares would likely trade in the over-the-counter market.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If our shares were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our common shares could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts coverage of us may be reduced.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition, in the event our common shares are delisted, broker-dealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common shares, further limiting the liquidity of our common shares.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for common shares.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Such delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market and continued or further declines in our share price and market value could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing, and could significantly increase the ownership dilution to shareholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our outstanding stock warrants may significantly increase the volatility of our stock price.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	All of our outstanding common stock warrants have been determined to represent liabilities under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	These instruments were recorded at their fair value as of the date of issuance.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	At each revaluation date, any subsequent changes in fair value will be recorded as a non-cash gain or loss in the statement of operations.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Based on the number of instruments issued and the potential volatility in the fair value of these instruments, the subsequent non-cash gains or losses in the statement of operations could be significant, which has the potential to increase the volatility of our stock price.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Due in part to our constrained financial resources, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates or those that are in-licensed.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We have limited technical, managerial and financial resources to determine the indications on which we should focus the development efforts related to our product candidates.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Due to our limited available financial resources, we have had to curtail clinical development programs and activities that might otherwise have led to more rapid progress of our product candidates through the regulatory and development processes.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	For example, in February 2010 we announced a restructuring of our clinical development programs.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	other clinical trial programs in favor of those we believe to have the highest value.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We may make incorrect determinations with regard to the indications and clinical trials on which to focus the available resources that we do have.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	The decisions to allocate our research, management and financial resources toward particular indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate drug development programs may also cause us to miss valuable opportunities.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P24_S4	In addition, from time to time, we may in-license or otherwise acquire product candidates to supplement our internal development activities.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Those activities may use resources that otherwise would have been devoted to our internal programs.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P24_S6	We cannot assure you that any resources that we devote to acquired or in-licensed programs will result in any products that are superior to our internally developed products.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our product candidates have not completed clinical trials, and may never demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in order to do so.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our product candidates are in an early stage of development.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In order to achieve profitable operations, we alone or in collaboration with others, must successfully develop, manufacture, introduce and market our products.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The time frame necessary to achieve market success for any individual product is long and uncertain.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	The products currently under development by us will require significant additional research and development and extensive preclinical and clinical testing prior to application for commercial use.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	A number of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after showing promising results in early or later-stage studies or clinical trials.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Although we have obtained some favorable results to-date in preclinical studies and clinical trials of certain of our potential products, such results may not be indicative of results that will ultimately be obtained in or throughout such clinical trials, and clinical trials may not show any of our products to be safe or capable of producing a desired result.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Additionally, we may encounter problems in our clinical trials that will cause us to delay, suspend or terminate those clinical trials.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Further, our research or product development efforts may not be successfully completed, any compounds currently under development by us may not be successfully developed into drugs, any potential products may not receive regulatory approval on a timely basis, if at all, and competitors may develop and bring to market products or technologies that render our potential products obsolete.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P27_S4	If any of these problems occur, our business would be materially and adversely affected.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our committed equity financing facility with Kingsbridge may not be available to us.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	If we elect to make a draw down, we may be required to make additional blackout or other payments to Kingsbridge, which may result in dilution to our stockholders.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	On February 19, 2008, we entered into a Committed Equity Financing Facility, or CEFF, with Kingsbridge Capital Limited, or Kingsbridge.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The terms of the CEFF were amended in February 2010.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The CEFF entitles us to sell and obligates Kingsbridge to purchase, from time to time until May 15, 2012, shares of our common stock for cash consideration up to an aggregate of $40 million, subject to certain conditions and restrictions.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Kingsbridge will not be obligated to purchase shares under the CEFF unless certain conditions are met, which include a minimum price for our common stock; the accuracy of representations and warranties made to Kingsbridge; compliance with laws; effectiveness of the registration statement registering the shares issuable to Kingsbridge under the CEFF for resale; and the continued listing of our stock on a principal market which includes the NASDAQ Capital Market.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	In addition, Kingsbridge is permitted to terminate the CEFF if it determines that a material and adverse event has occurred affecting our business, operations, properties or financial condition and if such condition continues for a period of 10 days from the date Kingsbridge provides us notice of such material and adverse event.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P30_S3	If we are unable to access funds through the CEFF, or if the CEFF is terminated by Kingsbridge, we may be unable to access capital on favorable terms or at all.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We are entitled, in certain circumstances, to deliver a blackout notice to Kingsbridge to suspend the use of the registration statement registering the shares issuable to Kingsbridge under the CEFF for resale and prohibit Kingsbridge from selling shares under the prospectus.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Kingsbridge additional shares in lieu of this payment, calculated on the basis of the number of shares held by Kingsbridge (exclusive of shares that Kingsbridge may hold pursuant to exercise of the Kingsbridge warrant) and the change in the market price of our common stock during the period in which the use of the registration statement is suspended.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	If the trading price of our common stock declines during a suspension of the registration statement, the blackout or other payment could be significant.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Should we sell shares to Kingsbridge under the CEFF, or issue shares in lieu of a blackout payment, such sale will have a dilutive effect on the holdings of our current stockholders, and may result in downward pressure on the price of OXiGENE common stock.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	If OXiGENE draws down under the CEFF, we will issue shares to Kingsbridge at a discount of up to 14% from the volume weighted average price of our common stock.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P33_S2	If OXiGENE draws down amounts under the CEFF when our share price is decreasing, we will need to issue more shares to raise the same amount than if our stock price was higher.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Issuances in the face of a declining share price will have an even greater dilutive effect than if OXiGENE s share price was stable or increasing, and may further decrease OXiGENE s share price.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We are not eligible to sell shares to Kingsbridge under the CEFF for so long as the closing price of our common stock is below $15.00 per share.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We depend heavily on our executive officers, directors, and principal consultants and the loss of their services would materially harm our business.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We believe that our success depends, and will likely continue to depend, upon our ability to retain the services of our current executive officers, directors, principal consultants and others.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In addition, we have established relationships with universities, hospitals and research institutions, which have historically provided, and continue to provide, us with access to research laboratories, clinical trials, facilities and patients.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Additionally, we believe that we may, at any time and from time to time, materially depend on the services of consultants and other unaffiliated third parties.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P36_S4	We cannot assure you that consultants and other unaffiliated third parties will provide the level of service to us that we require in order to achieve our business objectives.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our industry is highly competitive, and our products may become technologically obsolete.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We are engaged in a rapidly evolving field.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Competition from other pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and research and academic institutions is intense and expected to increase.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Many of those companies and institutions have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Those companies and institutions also have substantially greater experience in developing products, in conducting clinical trials, in obtaining regulatory approval and in manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for competitive products.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We are aware of at least one other company that currently has a clinical-stage VDA for use in an oncology indication.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Some of these competitive products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing the desired therapeutic effect than products being developed by us.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Our competitors may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective and/or cost competitive than those we are developing, or that would render our technology and products less competitive or even obsolete.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P39_S4	In addition, one or more of our competitors may achieve product commercialization or patent protection earlier than we do, which could materially adversely affect us.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We have licensed in rights to ZYBRESTAT, OXi4503 and other programs from third parties.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	If our license agreements terminate, we may lose the licensed rights to our product candidates, including ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503, and we may not be able to continue to develop them or, if they are approved, market or commercialize them.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We depend on license agreements with third parties for certain intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates, including patent rights.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Currently, we have licensed in patent rights from Arizona State University, or ASU, and the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company for ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503 and from Baylor University for other programs.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	performance obligations in order to keep these agreements in effect and retain our rights under them.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	These payment obligations can include upfront fees, maintenance fees, milestones, royalties, patent prosecution expenses, and other fees.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P42_S2	These performance obligations typically include diligence obligations.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P42_S3	If we fail to pay, be diligent or otherwise perform as required under our license agreements, we could lose the rights under the patents and other intellectual property rights covered by the agreements.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P42_S4	While we are not currently aware of any dispute with any licensors under our material agreements with them, if disputes arise under any of our in-licenses, including our in-licenses from ASU and the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, and Baylor University, we could lose our rights under these agreements.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P42_S5	Any such disputes may or may not be resolvable on favorable terms, or at all.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P42_S6	Whether or not any disputes of this kind are favorably resolved, our management s time and attention and our other resources could be consumed by the need to attend to and seek to resolve these disputes and our business could be harmed by the emergence of such a dispute.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	If we lose our rights under these agreements, we may not be able to conduct any further activities with the product candidate or program that the license covered.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P43_S1	If this were to happen, we might not be able to develop our product candidates further, or following regulatory approval, if any, we might be prohibited from marketing or commercializing them.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In particular, patents previously licensed to us might after termination be used to stop us from conducting these activities.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We depend extensively on our patents and proprietary technology, and we must protect those assets in order to preserve our business.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Although we expect to seek patent protection for any compounds we discover and/or for any specific use we discovers for new or previously known compounds, any or all of them may not be subject to effective patent protection.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Further, the development of regimens for the administration of pharmaceuticals, which generally involve specifications for the frequency, timing and amount of dosages, has been, and we believe, may continue to be, important to our effort, although those processes, as such, may not be patentable.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P45_S2	In addition, the issued patents may be declared invalid or our competitors may find ways to avoid the claims in the patents.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, protect our trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	As of March 9, 2011, we were the exclusive licensee, sole assignee or co-assignee of twenty-nine (29) granted United States patents, seventeen (17) pending United States patent applications, two (2) pending Patent Cooperation Treaty international patent applications, and granted patents and/or pending applications in several other major markets, including the European Union, Canada and Japan.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms like us are generally highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions, resulting in both an apparent inconsistency regarding the breadth of claims allowed in United States patents and general uncertainty as to their legal interpretation and enforceability.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Accordingly, patent applications assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not result in patents being issued, any issued patents assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not provide us with competitive protection or may be challenged by others, and the current or future granted patents of others may have an adverse effect on our ability to do business and achieve profitability.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Moreover, since some of the basic research relating to one or more of our patent applications and/or patents were performed at various universities and/or funded by grants, one or more universities, employees of such universities and/or grantors could assert that they have certain rights in such research and any resulting products.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Further, others may independently develop similar products, may duplicate our products, or may design around our patent rights.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P48_S4	In addition, as a result of the assertion of rights by a third party or otherwise, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of others in or outside of the United States.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P48_S5	Any licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights may not be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P48_S6	If we do not obtain such licenses, we could encounter delays in product market introductions while our attempts to design around such patents or could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is foreclosed.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P48_S7	In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against us or in connection with patents to which we hold licenses or in bringing suit to protect our own patents against infringement.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We require employees, Scientific Advisory Board members, Clinical Trial Advisory Board members, and the institutions that perform our preclinical and clinical trials to enter into confidentiality agreements with us.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Those agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the relationship with us to be kept confidential and not to be disclosed to third parties, except in specific circumstances.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Any such agreement may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	If third parties on which we rely for clinical trials do not perform as contractually required or as we expect, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We do not have the ability to independently conduct the clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	We depend on independent clinical investigators and, in some cases, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct the clinical trials of our product candidates and expect to continue to do so.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P51_S2	We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials, and we do not control many aspects of their activities.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Nonetheless, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with our general investigational plan and protocol.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Moreover, the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities require us and our clinical investigators to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting and recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P51_S6	Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or the respective trial plans and protocols.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P51_S7	The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates or result in enforcement action against us.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Our products may result in product liability exposure, and it is uncertain whether our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all claims.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The use of our product candidates in clinical trials and for commercial applications, if any, may expose us to liability claims, in the event such product candidates cause injury or disease, or result in adverse effects.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P53_S1	These claims could be made directly by health care institutions, contract laboratories, patients or others using such products.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Although we have obtained liability insurance coverage for our ongoing clinical trials, this coverage may not be in amounts sufficient to protect us from any product liability claims or product recalls which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Further, adverse product and similar liability claims could negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our technology and product candidates under development.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	If we do not obtain required regulatory approvals, we will be unable to market and sell our product candidates.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to development, clinical trials, manufacturing, and commercialization.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory review and approval process are required to be successfully completed in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new drug can be sold.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain, and subject to unanticipated delays.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P55_S3	The time required to obtain approval by the FDA is unpredictable but typically exceeds five years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the complexity of the product candidate.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P56_S1	In connection with the clinical trials of our product candidates, we face risks that:
908259_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	the results may not meet the level of statistical significance or clinical benefit-to-risk ratio required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for marketing approval.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Only a small percentage of product candidates for which clinical trials are initiated are the subject of NDAs and even fewer receive approval for commercialization.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Furthermore, even if we do receive regulatory approval to market a product candidate, any such approval may be subject to limitations such as those on the indicated uses for which we may market the product.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	If clinical trials for our product candidates are prolonged, delayed or suspended, we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis, which would require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any revenue from potential product sales.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or any regulatory authority to delay or suspend those clinical trials or delay the analysis of data derived from them.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P60_S1	A number of events, including any of the following, could delay the completion of our other ongoing and planned clinical trials and negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and to market and sell, a particular product candidate:
908259_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	failure of our third-party contractors to comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise meet their contractual obligations to us.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed by the imposition of additional conditions on our clinical trials by the FDA or any foreign regulatory authority or the requirement of additional supportive studies by the FDA or any foreign regulatory authority.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P62_S1	In addition, clinical trials require sufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the conduct of other clinical trials that compete for the same patients as our clinical trials, and the eligibility criteria for our clinical trials.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Our failure to enroll patients in our clinical trials could delay the completion of the clinical trial beyond our expectations.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P62_S3	In addition, the FDA could require us to conduct clinical trials with a larger number of subjects than we have projected for any of our product candidates.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P62_S4	We may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in a timely or cost-effective manner.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P62_S5	Furthermore, enrolled patients may drop out of our clinical trials, which could impair the validity or statistical significance of the clinical trials.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We do not know whether our clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured, or will be completed on schedule, if at all.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Delays in our clinical trials will result in increased development costs for our product candidates.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P63_S2	In addition, if our clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be limited.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our product candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory review even if they receive marketing approval, and if we fail to comply with continuing regulations, we could lose these approvals and the sale of any approved commercial products could be suspended.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Even if we receive regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, and record keeping related to the product will remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P65_S1	If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA and other applicable domestic and foreign regulatory authorities or previously unknown problems with any approved product, manufacturer, or manufacturing process is discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:
908259_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	If physicians and patients do not accept our future products or if the markets for indications for which any product candidate is approved is smaller than expected, we may be unable to generate significant revenue, if any.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Even if any of our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, and third-party payors.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Physicians may decide to not recommend these drugs for a variety of reasons including:
908259_11_ITEM1A_P69_S0	ineffective marketing and distribution support of our products.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P70_S0	If any approved drugs fail to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenue and our business would suffer.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We have no manufacturing capacity, and have relied and expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P72_S0	lack the resources and the capabilities to do so.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P72_S1	As a result, we currently rely, and we expect to rely in the future, on third-party manufacturers to supply our product candidates.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our product candidates or products ourselves, including:
908259_11_ITEM1A_P73_S0	the possible termination or non-renewal of the agreement by the third party, based on our own business priorities, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P74_S0	If we do not maintain our developed important manufacturing relationships, we may fail to find replacement manufacturers or develop our own manufacturing capabilities which could delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products and substantially increase our costs or deplete profit margins, if any.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P74_S1	If we do find replacement manufacturers, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us, and there could be a substantial delay before new facilities could be qualified and registered with the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P75_S0	The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require manufacturers to register manufacturing facilities.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P75_S1	The FDA and corresponding foreign regulators also inspect these facilities to confirm compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Contract manufacturers may face manufacturing or quality control problems causing drug substance production and shipment delays or a situation where the contractor may not be able to maintain compliance with the applicable cGMP requirements.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P75_S3	Any failure to comply with cGMP requirements or other FDA and comparable foreign regulatory requirements could adversely affect our clinical research activities and our ability to develop our product candidates and market our products after approval.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop our product candidates and commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely basis.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Our restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated by-laws, our stockholder rights agreement and Delaware law could deter a change of our management which could discourage or delay offers to acquire us.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Certain provisions of Delaware law and of our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated by-laws could discourage or make it more difficult to accomplish a proxy contest or other change in our management or the acquisition of control by a holder of a substantial amount of our voting stock.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P78_S1	It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish, or could deter, transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interests or the best interests of us.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P78_S2	Further, the rights issued under the stockholder rights agreement would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our Board of Directors.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P79_S0	The uncertainty associated with pharmaceutical reimbursement and related matters may adversely affect our business.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Upon the marketing approval of any one or more of our products, if at all, sales of our products will depend significantly on the extent to which reimbursement for our products and related treatments will be available from government health programs, private health insurers and other third-party payers.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Third-party payers and governmental health programs are increasingly attempting to limit and/or regulate the price of medical products and services.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P81_S1	The MMA, as well as other changes in governmental or in private third-party payers reimbursement policies, may reduce or eliminate any currently expected reimbursement.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P82_S0	adverse effect on our product sales, results of operations and financial condition.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P83_S0	On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P83_S1	This law provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P83_S2	A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P83_S3	Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate any policies for public or private payers, it is not clear what, if any, effect the research will have on the sales of our products if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P83_S4	Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third-party payer to not cover our products could reduce physician usage of the product and have a material adverse effect on our product sales, results of operations and financial condition.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P84_S0	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Affordable Care Act or the ACA) enacted in March 2010, are expected to have a significant impact on the health care industry.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P84_S1	ACA is expected to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time contain overall healthcare costs.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P84_S2	With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, ACA is expected to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare D program.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P84_S3	We cannot predict the impact of ACA on the pharmaceutical companies as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions which has not yet occurred.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P84_S4	In addition, the current legal challenges to ACA, as well as congressional efforts to repeal ACA, add to the uncertainty of the legislative changes enacted as part of ACA.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P85_S0	The price of our common stock is volatile, and is likely to continue to fluctuate due to reasons beyond our control.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P86_S0	The market price of our common stock has been, and likely will continue to be highly volatile.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Factors, including our financial results or our competitors financial results, clinical trial and research development announcements and government regulatory action affecting our potential products in both the United States and foreign countries, have had, and may continue to have, a significant effect on our results of operations and on the market price of our common stock.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P86_S2	We cannot assure you that your investment in our common stock will not fluctuate significantly.
908259_11_ITEM1A_P86_S3	One or more of these factors could significantly harm our business and cause a decline in the price of our common stock in the public market.

908259_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table sets forth financial data with respect to the Company for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2010.
908259_11_ITEM6_P0_S1	The selected financial data for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2010 has been derived from the audited financial statements of the Company.
908259_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
908259_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or outcomes to be materially different from those anticipated and discussed herein.

908259_11_ITEM7_P0_S3	In assessing forward-looking statements contained herein, readers are urged to read carefully all Risk Factors and cautionary statements contained in this Annual Report.
908259_11_ITEM7_P0_S4	Further, we operate in an industry sector where securities values are volatile and may be influenced by regulatory and other factors beyond our control.
908259_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are a clinical-stage, biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics to treat cancer and eye diseases.
908259_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our primary focus is the development of product candidates referred to as vascular disrupting agents, or VDAs, that selectively disable and destroy abnormal blood vessels that provide solid tumors a means of growth and survival and also are associated with visual impairment in a number of ophthalmological diseases and conditions.
908259_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	To date, more than 400 subjects have been treated with ZYBRESTAT, our lead candidate, in human clinical trials, and the drug candidate has generally been observed to be well-tolerated.
908259_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	In earlier Phase 1 studies of ZYBRESTAT in anaplastic thyroid cancer, or ATC, clinical investigators observed several objective responses in treatment with ZYBRESTAT, including a complete response lasting more than 13 years, in patients with ATC.
908259_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	of one year survival in a disease where median expected survival of patients is approximately 3-4 months from the time of diagnosis and fewer than 10% of patients are typically alive at one year.
908259_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Based on this encouraging data, we completed a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, process with the FDA in 2007, for a Phase 2/3 study, which we refer to as the FACT trial, in which ZYBRESTAT was to be evaluated in 180 patients as a potential treatment for ATC.
908259_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	ATC is a highly aggressive and lethal malignancy for which there are currently no approved therapeutics and extremely limited treatment options.
908259_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	ZYBRESTAT was awarded orphan drug status by the FDA and the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of advanced ATC and for the treatment of medullary, Stage IV papillary and Stage IV follicular thyroid cancers.
908259_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	The FDA also granted Fast Track designation to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of regionally advanced and/or metastatic ATC.
908259_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	The primary endpoint for the FACT trial is overall survival.
908259_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Eligible patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed ATC were randomized either to the treatment arm of the study, in which they received ZYBRESTAT in combination with the chemotherapeutic agents carboplatin and paclitaxel, or to the control arm of the study, in which they received only carboplatin and paclitaxel.
908259_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	Central pathology review by external pathologists not associated with the study was utilized to confirm the histological diagnosis.
908259_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	The FACT trial began enrolling patients in 2007.
908259_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	A total of 40 clinical sites in 11 countries participated in this clinical study, which was conducted in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines and the SPA.
908259_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	Due to the rarity of the disease and the fact that most of the patients screened for the study either progressed or no longer met the trial s inclusion criteria, the enrollment period spanned more than twice the planned 18 month period.
908259_11_ITEM7_P9_S3	As a result of both the length of the enrollment period and financial constraints affecting the Company, in February 2010, we chose to continued to treat and follow all 80 patients who were enrolled in the Phase 2/3 FACT clinical trial in ATC in accordance with the SPA, but to stop further enrollment.
908259_11_ITEM7_P9_S4	Initial data from this trial was presented at both the 14th International Thyroid Congress on September 12, 2010 in Paris, France and the 35th European Society of Medical Oncology Congress on October 11, 2010 in Milan, Italy.
908259_11_ITEM7_P9_S5	At these meetings, we reported data suggesting a benefit in overall survival in patients receiving ZYBRESTAT in combination with chemotherapy.
908259_11_ITEM7_P9_S6	Of particular note was the fact that the one year survival rate was doubled for patients receiving ZYBRESTAT.
908259_11_ITEM7_P9_S7	The additional data we presented in October also included some subgroup analyses that confirmed the overall survival benefit and also indicated that ZYBRESTAT improved the survival of patients with the most advanced stages of the disease, as well as patients who had been heavily pretreated with surgery, radiation or chemotherapy.
908259_11_ITEM7_P9_S8	Data from an additional event-driven survival analysis among the 80 enrolled patients are anticipated in the first half of 2011.
908259_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	The FDA has been informed that enrollment in this study was halted at 80 patients and that we expected that the SPA would no longer be applicable.
908259_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	The orphan drug status and the expedited review designations have not been affected by the halted enrollment in the Phase 2/3 study.
908259_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	We requested a meeting with the FDA to discuss the results of this study and a potential path forward in light of the data from this study.
908259_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	In February 2011 the FDA notified us that it would meet with the Company on March 16, 2011.
908259_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	We are currently evaluating ZYBRESTAT in a 63-patient, randomized, controlled Phase 2 clinical trial, which we refer to as the FALCON trial, as a potential first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC.
908259_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	In the FALCON trial, patients are randomized either to the treatment arm of study, in which they receive ZYBRESTAT in combination with the chemotherapeutic agents, carboplatin and paclitaxel, and bevacizumab, a drug that interferes with blood vessel growth, or angiogenics, or to the control arm of the study, in which they receive a standard combination regimen of carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab.
908259_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	We believe this study will suggest a benefit of ZYBRESTAT in NSCLC therapy.
908259_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	We further believe that these data could be used to design a pivotal registration program with ZYBRESTAT in NSCLC and more generally, provide clinical validation supporting further evaluation of ZYBRESTAT in combination with commonly used anti-angiogenic therapeutics that act by selectively inhibiting a particular blood vessel growth path, namely, the vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, pathway.
908259_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	On June 6, 2010, we reported updated safety and clinical activity data from the FALCON trial at the 2010 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).
908259_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	The updated analysis showed that for the 53 patients treated in this study as of the date of the analysis, meaningful improvements were observed in response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival rates in the study arm (ZYBRESTAT combined with bevacizumab and carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy) as compared with the control arm (bevacizumab and chemotherapy) of the trial.
908259_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	The combination regimen including ZYBRESTAT was observed to be well-tolerated with no significant cumulative toxicities when compared with the control arm of the study.
908259_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	On June 16, 2010, we announced the completion of enrollment in the FALCON trial.
908259_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	We presented an update of the safety and clinical activity data for this trial at the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer symposium in November 2010 in Berlin, Germany.
908259_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	The combination regimen including ZYBRESTAT was again observed to be well-tolerated with no significant cumulative toxicities when compared with the control arm of the study.
908259_11_ITEM7_P13_S3	We expect to present the overall survival data from this study at the ASCO meeting in June 2011.
908259_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	On June 1, 2009, results from a Phase 2 trial with ZYBRESTAT in combination with the chemotherapeutic agents, carboplatin and paclitaxel, in recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, were presented at ASCO.
908259_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	We believe the results of this study support further development of ZYBRESTAT in ovarian cancer and we are considering options for undertaking further randomized, controlled studies in ovarian cancer.
908259_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Based on the results of this Phase 2 study, in February 2011 we announced that we entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the National Cancer Institute s (NCI) Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) to collaborate on the conduct of a randomized Phase 2 trial of ZYBRESTAT in combination with bevacizumab in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer.
908259_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	We will provide ZYBRESTAT to NCI for an NCI-sponsored study conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG), an organization dedicated to clinical research in the field of gynecologic cancer.
908259_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	The aim of the trial will be to determine if the combination of ZYBRESTAT and bevacizumab will enhance anti-tumor effects and further delay tumor progression when compared to bevacizumab alone.
908259_11_ITEM7_P15_S3	We anticipate that investigators will initiate enrollment in this Phase 2 study in the first half of 2011.
908259_11_ITEM7_P15_S4	The primary endpoint of the study will be progression-free survival, with results expected to become available in early 2013.
908259_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	We believe that, if successful, the ongoing ZYBRESTAT for Oncology program will establish a compelling rationale for further development of ZYBRESTAT as a treatment for:
908259_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	use in combination with commonly used drugs, such as bevacizumab, that interfere with blood vessel growth, or angiogenics, in various solid tumor indications.
908259_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	We believe these areas for potential further development collectively represent a significant unmet medical need and thus a significant potential commercial market opportunity that includes cancers of the thyroid, ovary, kidney, liver, head and neck, breast, lung, skin, brain, colon and rectum.
908259_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	In addition, based upon preclinical results published by our collaborators in the February 2008 and September 2010 issues of the journal BLOOD, as well as preclinical data presented in April 2009 at the annual meeting of the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR), we believe that ZYBRESTAT and its other VDA product candidates, particularly OXi4503, may also have utility in the treatment of hematological malignancies such as acute leukemias and lymphomas.
908259_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	We are currently pursuing development of OXi4503, a second-generation, dual-mechanism VDA, as a treatment for certain solid tumor types.
908259_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	We believe that OXi4503 is differentiated from other VDAs by its dual-action activity.
908259_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	Our data indicates that in addition to having potent vascular disrupting effects, OXi4503 is unique in that certain enzymes in the human body can help convert it to a form of chemical that has direct tumor cell killing effects.
908259_11_ITEM7_P20_S3	We believe this unique property may result in enhanced anti-tumor activity in certain tumor types as compared with other VDA drug candidates.
908259_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Based on data from preclinical studies, we believe that OXi4503 may have enhanced activity in tumor types with relatively high levels of the type of enzymes that can facilitate the conversion of OXi4503 to the form of chemical that kills tumor cells.
908259_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	These tumor types include hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, and myeloid leukemia.
908259_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	In preclinical studies, OXi4503 has shown potent anti-tumor activity against solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia models, both as a single agent and in combination with other cancer treatment modalities.
908259_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	We have completed a Phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors sponsored by Clinical Research United Kingdom.
908259_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	In collaboration with us, Professor Gordon Rustin and colleagues from the Mount Vernon Cancer Research Centre, UK and other institutions in the United Kingdom, reported positive final data from this study at the 2010 ASCO Annual Meeting.
908259_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	In this study, 45 patients with advanced solid tumors who had declined or were unresponsive to standard treatment were treated with escalating doses of OXi4503.
908259_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	Partial responses were observed in two patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and stable disease was observed in 9 patients.
908259_11_ITEM7_P22_S4	OXi4503 was also observed to be well-tolerated in this study.
908259_11_ITEM7_P22_S5	To date, OXi4503 has been observed to have a manageable side-effect profile similar to that of other agents in the VDA class, potential single-agent clinical activity, and effects on tumor blood flow and tumor metabolic activity, as determined with several imaging modalities.
908259_11_ITEM7_P22_S6	We also evaluated escalating doses of OXi4503 in an ongoing OXiGENE-sponsored Phase 1b trial, initiated in the first quarter of 2009 in patients with solid tumors with hepatic involvement.
908259_11_ITEM7_P22_S7	This study confirmed the recommended dose established in the first Phase 1 study.
908259_11_ITEM7_P22_S8	Patient follow-up and final analysis of the data from the latter trial is ongoing.
908259_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Based on the results of preclinical studies published in the journal Blood in September 2010 that show OXi4503 has potent activity against AML in animal models, we expect that investigators at the University of Florida will initiate an investigator sponsored Phase 1 study of OXi4503 in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in the first half of 2011.
908259_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	We expect the open-label, dose-escalating study for the treatment of up to 36 patients to be conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory AML and MDS and will evaluate the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose and biologic activity of OXi4503 in these patients.
908259_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	We expect that initial indications of biologic activity from this study may be available as early as the first half of 2012.
908259_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	The general direction of future development of OXi4503 solid tumors or hematologic indications will depend on the outcome of the analysis of both the solid tumor studies and the study in AML, as well as available financial resources and potential partnering activities.
908259_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	In addition to developing ZYBRESTAT as an intravenously administered therapy for oncology indications, we have undertaken an ophthalmology research and development program with ZYBRESTAT with the ultimate goal of developing a topical formulation of ZYBRESTAT for ophthalmological diseases and conditions that are characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth within the eye that result in loss of vision.
908259_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	Previously, we reported results at the 2007 annual meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, or ARVO, from a Phase 2 study in patients with myopic macular degeneration in which all patients in the study met the primary clinical endpoint of vision stabilization at three months after study entry.
908259_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	In December 2010, we completed a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled Phase 2 proof-of-mechanism trial, which we refer to as the FAVOR trial, with a single dose of intravenously-administered ZYBRESTAT in patients with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), a form of choroidal neovascularization, which is a condition where new blood vessels form in the choroid, a part of the eye, and which can lead to vision loss and, ultimately, blindness.
908259_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	interfere with blood vessel growth, known as anti-angiogenics, appear to provide limited benefit.
908259_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	We believe that the architecture of the abnormal vasculature in certain eye tissues, namely the retina and choroid, which contribute to PCV patients loss of vision, may be particularly susceptible to treatment with a VDA such as ZYBRESTAT.
908259_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	We believe that PCV represents an attractive target indication and development pathway for ZYBRESTAT.
908259_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	Unlike wet age-related macular degeneration, an indication for which several anti-angiogenic drugs are approved or prescribed off-label, conducting clinical studies of ZYBRESTAT in patients with ophthalmologic indications not yet approved for treatment with such anti-angiogenic drugs could potentially prove to reduce development time and expense.
908259_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	The objectives of the FAVOR trial and the ongoing preclinical program with ZYBRESTAT are:
908259_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	further evaluate the feasibility of developing a topical formulation of ZYBRESTAT for ophthalmological indications.
908259_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	Findings from the Phase 2 study, including effects on retinal thickness and retinal bleeding, are expected to be presented at a future ophthalmology meeting.
908259_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	We believe that a safe, effective and convenient topically-administered anti-vascular therapeutic would have advantages over currently approved anti-vascular, ophthalmological therapeutics, many of which must be injected directly into patients eyes, in some cases on a chronic monthly basis.
908259_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	For this purpose we have been developing a potential minitab topical formulation of ZYBRESTAT which has demonstrated attractive pharmacokinetic and safety properties and efficacy in destroying abnormal vasculature in a rat choroidal melanoma model following administration in the eye.
908259_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	We believe that a topical formulation would enhance our partnering opportunities to further develop ZYBRESTAT in diseases of the eye.
908259_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	To date, we have completed preclinical testing that indicated that ZYBRESTAT has activity in six different preclinical ophthalmology models, including a model in which ZYBRESTAT was combined with an approved drug that interferes with blood vessel growth, or anti-angiogenic agents.
908259_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	We have also completed multiple preclinical studies suggesting that ZYBRESTAT, when applied topically to the surface of the eye at doses that appear to be well-tolerated, penetrates to the retina and choroid in quantities that it believes should be sufficient for therapeutic activity.
908259_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	We are also evaluating the requirements for additional preclinical toxicology and efficacy studies with ZYBRESTAT for topical ophthalmological formulations to better position the program for partnering.
908259_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	Further development of this program will depend on the outcome of our evaluation of these requirements and available financial resources.
908259_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	We have generated a cumulative net loss of approximately $207,700,000 for the period from our inception through December 31, 2010.
908259_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	We expect to incur significant additional operating losses over at least the next several years, principally as a result of our continuing clinical trials and anticipated research and development expenditures.
908259_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	The principal source of our working capital to date has been the proceeds of private and public equity financings and to a lesser extent the exercise of warrants and stock options.
908259_11_ITEM7_P35_S3	We currently have no material amount of licensing or other fee income.
908259_11_ITEM7_P35_S4	As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $4,677,000 in cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents.
908259_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	On February 11, 2010, we announced a restructuring of our clinical development programs.
908259_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	This restructuring plan was designed to focus our resources on our highest-value clinical assets and reduce our cash utilization.
908259_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	As a part of this restructuring we stopped further enrollment in our Phase 2/3 anaplastic thyroid cancer clinical trial (FACT) and reduced our work force by approximately 49% (20 employees).
908259_11_ITEM7_P36_S3	In addition, the further development of our ongoing clinical trials will depend on upcoming analysis and results of these ongoing clinical studies and our cash resources at that time.
908259_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	We incurred a one-time charge in connection with the reduction of our work force of approximately $510,000 in the first quarter of 2010 for severance pay and benefits to those former employees affected by the reduction.
908259_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	This re-alignment of priorities in clinical programs together with reductions in force reduced the cash required to operate our business to between $3,500,000 and $4,500,000 per quarter in the second half of 2010.
908259_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	As our current ongoing trials proceed to completion, we expect the per quarter cash requirement to continue to decline to the $2,500,000 to $3,000,000 range over the course of 2011.
908259_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	On March 11, 2010, we completed a definitive agreement with certain institutional investors to sell shares of our common stock and four separate series of warrants to purchase common stock in a private placement.
908259_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	Gross proceeds of the financing were approximately $7,500,000, before deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses.
908259_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	On July 21, 2010, we entered into an at the market (ATM) equity offering sales agreement with McNicoll, Lewis Vlak LLC, or MLV, pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through MLV acting as our sales agent and underwriter.
908259_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	Sales of our common stock through MLV, are made on the principal trading market of our common stock by means of ordinary brokers transactions at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by MLV and us.
908259_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	MLV uses its commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock from time to time, based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits we may impose).
908259_11_ITEM7_P39_S3	We pay MLV a commission rate of up to 7.0% of the gross sales price per share of any common stock sold through MLV as agent under the sales agreement.
908259_11_ITEM7_P39_S4	We have also provided MLV with customary indemnification rights.
908259_11_ITEM7_P39_S5	From the date of the initial agreement through January 2011, we sold a total of 712,500 shares of our common stock with net proceeds of approximately $3,986,000.
908259_11_ITEM7_P39_S6	On January 31, 2011, we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we may issue and sell additional shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $4,790,000 under the ATM.
908259_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	In February 2008, we entered into a Committed Equity Financing Facility ( CEFF ) with Kingsbridge Capital, which was subsequently amended in February 2010.
908259_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	Under the terms of the amended CEFF, Kingsbridge committed to purchase, subject to certain conditions, up to 285,401 shares of the Company s common stock during the period which ends May 15, 2012.
908259_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	Under the CEFF, we are able to draw down in tranches of up to a maximum of 3.75 percent of our closing market value at the time of the draw down or the alternative draw down amount calculated pursuant to the Common stock Purchase Agreement, whichever is less, subject to certain conditions.
908259_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	The purchase price of these shares is discounted between 5 to 14 percent from the volume weighted average price of our common stock for each of the eight trading days following the election to sell shares.
908259_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	Kingsbridge is not obligated to purchase shares at prices below $15.00 per share or at a price below 85% of the closing share price of our stock on the trading day immediately preceding the commencement of the draw down, whichever is higher.
908259_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	In connection with the CEFF, in 2008, we issued a warrant to Kingsbridge to purchase 12,500 shares of our common stock at a price of $54.80 per share exercisable beginning six months after February 19, 2008 for a period of five years thereafter.
908259_11_ITEM7_P41_S3	As of December 31, 2010, there remain a total of 253,671 shares available for sale under the CEFF.
908259_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	We expect our existing cash and cash equivalents to support our operations through the first quarter of 2011.
908259_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	Assuming that net proceeds from the potential sale of shares at current market prices under the ATM sales agreement described above are received ratably over the March 2011 to June 2011 timeframe, we expect that our existing financial resources, together with the expected net proceeds from the ATM, would be sufficient to fund its operations through the second quarter of 2011.
908259_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Company will sell any additional shares under the ATM sales agreement, or, if it does, as to the price or amount of shares that it will sell, or the dates on which any such sales will take place.
908259_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	We will require significant additional funding to remain a going concern and to fund operations.
908259_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	Such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
908259_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	If we are unable to access additional funds when needed, we may not be able to continue the development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations.
908259_11_ITEM7_P44_S3	Any additional equity financing, which may not be available to us or may not be available on favorable terms, most likely will be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_11_ITEM7_P44_S4	If we access funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own, on terms that are not favorable to us.
908259_11_ITEM7_P44_S5	Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_11_ITEM7_P44_S6	These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
908259_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	The Report of Independent Registered Accounting Firm at the beginning of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of this Form 10-K includes a going concern explanatory paragraph.
908259_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	The financial statements presented in this Form 10-K have been prepared on a basis which assumes that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
908259_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	We expect to continue to pursue strategic alliances and consider collaborative development opportunities that may provide us with access to organizations that have capabilities and/or products that are complementary to our own, in order to continue the development of our potential product candidates.
908259_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	However, there can be no assurances that we will complete any strategic alliances or collaborative development agreements, and the terms of such arrangements may not be advantageous to us.
908259_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	We are committed to a disciplined financial strategy and as such maintain a limited employee and facilities base, with development, scientific, finance and administrative functions, which include, among other things, product development, regulatory oversight and clinical testing.
908259_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	Our research and development team members typically work on a number of development projects concurrently.
908259_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	Accordingly, we do not separately track the costs for each of these research and development projects to enable separate disclosure of these costs on a project-by-project basis.
908259_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	We conduct scientific activities pursuant to collaborative arrangements with universities.
908259_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	Regulatory and clinical testing functions are generally contracted out to third-party, specialty organizations.
908259_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
908259_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
908259_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to intangible assets.
908259_11_ITEM7_P50_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
908259_11_ITEM7_P50_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
908259_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements included in this report, we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.
908259_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
908259_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
908259_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	We have no significant off balance sheet concentrations of credit risk.
908259_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents.
908259_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	We hold our cash and cash equivalents at one financial institution.
908259_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	We consider all highly liquid financial instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
908259_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	We have $75,000 that is used to secure financing through a Company credit card.
908259_11_ITEM7_P54_S2	This amount is separated from cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
908259_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	We view our marketable securities as available for use in our current operations, and accordingly designate our marketable securities as available-for-sale.
908259_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, if any, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity.
908259_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	We review the status of the unrealized gains and losses of our available-for-sale marketable securities on a regular basis.
908259_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in investment income.
908259_11_ITEM7_P55_S4	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in investment income.
908259_11_ITEM7_P55_S5	Securities in an unrealized loss position deemed not to be other-than-temporarily impaired, due to management s positive intent and ability to hold the securities until anticipated recovery, with maturation greater than twelve months are classified as long-term assets.
908259_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	We charge all research and development expenses, both internal and external costs, to operations as incurred.
908259_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	Our research and development costs represent expenses incurred from the engagement of outside professional service organizations, product manufacturers and consultants associated with the development of our potential product candidates.
908259_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	We recognize expense associated with these arrangements based on the completion of activities as specified in the applicable contracts.
908259_11_ITEM7_P56_S3	Costs incurred under fixed fee contracts are accrued ratably over the contract period absent any knowledge that the services will be performed other than ratably.
908259_11_ITEM7_P56_S4	Costs incurred under contracts with clinical trial sites and principal investigators are generally accrued on a patients-treated basis consistent with the terms outlined in the contract.
908259_11_ITEM7_P56_S5	In determining costs incurred on some of these programs, we take into consideration a number of factors, including estimates and input provided by our internal program managers.
908259_11_ITEM7_P56_S6	Upon termination of such contracts, we are normally only liable for costs incurred or committed to date.
908259_11_ITEM7_P56_S7	As a result, accrued research and development expenses represent our estimated contractual liability to outside service providers at any of the relevant times.
908259_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	Any advance payments for goods or services to be used or rendered in future research and development activities pursuant to an executory contractual arrangement are properly classified as prepaid until such goods or services are rendered.
908259_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	On August 2, 1999, we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by Arizona State University.
908259_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	The present value of the amount payable under the license agreement has been capitalized based on a discounted cash flow model and is being amortized over the term of the agreement (approximately 15.5 years).
908259_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	perform an impairment analysis of its long-lived assets if triggering events occur.
908259_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	We review for such triggering events periodically including triggering events such as a going concern opinion and continuing losses occurred.
908259_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	In addition, the agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals, which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones as defined in the agreement.
908259_11_ITEM7_P59_S3	We expense these payments to research and development in the period that payment becomes both probable and estimable.
908259_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	We record the expense recognition of the estimated fair value of all share-based payments issued to employees.
908259_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	The valuation of employee stock options is an inherently subjective process, since market values are generally not available for long-term, non-transferable employee stock options.
908259_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	Accordingly, an option pricing model is utilized to derive an estimated fair value.
908259_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	In calculating the estimated fair value of our stock options, we used the Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires the consideration of the following six variables for purposes of estimating fair value:
908259_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	the risk free interest rate for the expected option term.
908259_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	The closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant.
908259_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	The expected term of options represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on an analysis of historical behavior of participants over time.
908259_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	The expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the term of the option granted.
908259_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	We determine the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term.
908259_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	Expected Dividends Because we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on any of our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future, we use an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option.
908259_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury issues with a remaining life consistent with the option s expected term on the date of grant.
908259_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	Of the variables above, the selection of an expected term and expected stock price volatility are the most subjective.
908259_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	We are required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
908259_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	Accordingly, we perform a historical analysis of option awards that are forfeited prior to vesting, and record total stock option expense that reflects this estimated forfeiture rate.
908259_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	We segregate participants into two distinct groups, (1) directors and officers and (2) employees, and apply the estimated forfeiture rates using the Straight Line (Uniform) method to record expense.
908259_11_ITEM7_P70_S3	This analysis is re-evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate adjusted as necessary.
908259_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	In October 2008, we announced a strategic collaboration with Symphony Capital Partners, L.P. (Symphony), a private-equity firm, under which Symphony agreed to provide up to $40,000,000 in funding to support the advancement of ZYBRESTAT for oncology, ZYBRESTAT for ophthalmology and OXi4503.
908259_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	In connection with the collaboration, we granted Symphony ViDA, Inc., a newly-created drug development company, exclusive licenses to ZYBRESTAT for use in ophthalmologic indications and OXi4503.
908259_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	Under the collaboration, we entered into a series of related agreements with Symphony Capital LLC, Symphony ViDA, Symphony ViDA Holdings LLC (Holdings) and related entities, including a Purchase Option Agreement, a Research and Development Agreement, a Technology License Agreement and an Additional Funding Agreement.
908259_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	In addition, we entered into a series of related agreements with Holdings, including a Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement and a Registration Rights Agreement.
908259_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	Pursuant to these agreements, Holdings formed and capitalized Symphony ViDA in order (a) to hold certain intellectual property related to the programs which were exclusively licensed to Symphony ViDA under the Technology License Agreement and (b) to fund commitments of up to $25,000,000.
908259_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	The funding was intended to support preclinical and clinical development by us, on behalf of Symphony ViDA, of the programs.
908259_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	We issued to Holdings, pursuant to the Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement, an aggregate of 675,675 shares of its common stock and warrants at a price of $22.20 per share, which was the closing price of its common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on September 30, 2008, the day before we entered into the Symphony transaction.
908259_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	In addition, pursuant to the Purchase Option Agreement, we issued to Holdings an aggregate of 180,180 shares of our common stock with a fair value of $4,000,000 as consideration for the Purchase Option.
908259_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	On July 2, 2009, the Company, Holdings and Symphony ViDA entered into a series of related agreements pursuant to which we exercised the Purchase Option under terms set forth in an amended and restated purchase option agreement (the Amended Purchase Option Agreement), and the Company and Holdings also entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement.
908259_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	We closed on the amended Purchase Option on July 20, 2009 and issued 500,000 shares of our common stock to Holdings at the closing in exchange for all of the equity of Symphony ViDA.
908259_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	In addition, upon the closing of the Purchase Option, we re-acquired all of the rights to the programs, and the approximately $12,400,000 in cash held by Symphony ViDA at the time of the closing became available for use for general corporate purposes.
908259_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	A variable interest entity (VIE) is (1) an entity that has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or (2) an entity that has equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity s operations or that do not absorb their proportionate share of the expected losses or do not receive the expected residual returns of the entity.
908259_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	A VIE should be consolidated by the party that is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, which is the party that has exposure to a majority of the potential variability in the VIE s outcomes.
908259_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	The application of accounting policy to a given arrangement requires significant management judgment.
908259_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	We consolidated the financial position and results of operations of Symphony ViDA, Inc. ( ViDA ) from October 2008, when it entered into a strategic collaboration with Symphony ViDA Holdings, LLC ( Symphony ), until July 20, 2009 when we acquired 100% of ViDA pursuant to an Amended and Restated Purchase Option Agreement.
908259_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	We believe ViDA was by design a VIE because we had a purchase option to acquire its outstanding voting stock at prices that are fixed based upon the date the option is exercised.
908259_11_ITEM7_P79_S2	The fixed nature of the purchase option price limited Symphony ViDA Holding s returns, as the investor in ViDA.
908259_11_ITEM7_P79_S3	Further, due to the direct investment from Holdings in our common stock, as a related party ViDA was a VIE of which we were the primary beneficiary.
908259_11_ITEM7_P79_S4	After we exercised the purchase option, ViDA became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours and ceased being a VIE.
908259_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	On January 1, 2009, we adopted (retrospectively for all periods presented) the new presentation requirements for noncontrolling interests required by ASC 810, Consolidations.
908259_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	Under ASC 810, earnings or losses attributed to the noncontrolling interests are reported as part of consolidated earnings and not as a separate component of income or expense.
908259_11_ITEM7_P80_S2	Accordingly, we reported the consolidated earnings of ViDA in its consolidated statement of operations from October 2008, when we entered into a strategic collaboration with Symphony, until July 20, 2009, when we acquired 100% of the equity of ViDA pursuant to the Amended and Restated Purchase Option Agreement.
908259_11_ITEM7_P80_S3	Once becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary, the operating results of ViDA continued to be included in our consolidated statement of operations but were no longer subject to the presentation requirements applicable to noncontrolling interests.
908259_11_ITEM7_P80_S4	Losses incurred by ViDA, and attributable to Symphony, were charged to noncontrolling interest.
908259_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	We evaluate all derivative financial instruments issued in connection with our equity offerings when determining the proper accounting treatment for such instruments in the Company s financial statements.
908259_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	The Company considers a number of generally accepted accounting principles to determine such treatment.
908259_11_ITEM7_P81_S2	The Company performs a number of steps to evaluate the features of the instrument against the guidance provided in the accounting pronouncements in order to determine the appropriate accounting treatment.
908259_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	The Company s policy with regard to settling outstanding financial instruments is to settle those with the earliest maturity date first which essentially sets the order of preference for settling the awards.
908259_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	In the majority of circumstances, we utilize the Black Scholes method to determine the fair value of our derivative financial instruments.
908259_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	In some cases, where appropriate, we utilize the Binomial method to determine the fair value of such derivative financial instruments.
908259_11_ITEM7_P83_S2	Key valuation factors in determining the fair value include the current stock price as of the date of measurement, the exercise price, the remaining contractual life, expected volatility for the instrument and the risk-free interest rate.
908259_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	Changes in fair value are recorded as a gain or loss in our Statement of Operations with the corresponding amount recorded as an adjustment to the liability on our Balance Sheet.
908259_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	The expected volatility factor, in particular, is subject to significant variability from measurement period to measurement period and can result in large gains or losses from period to period.
908259_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	We did not recognize any license revenue in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, in connection with the license of our nutritional and diagnostic technology or otherwise.
908259_11_ITEM7_P86_S1	Future revenues, if any, from this license agreement are expected to be minimal.
908259_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	Our future revenues will depend upon our ability to establish collaborations with respect to, and generate revenues from products currently under development by us.
908259_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	We expect that we will not generate meaningful revenue unless and until we enter into new collaborations providing for funding through the payment of licensing fees and up-front payments.
908259_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	The following table summarizes our operating expenses for the periods indicated, in thousands and as a percentage of total expenses:
908259_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	The table below summarizes the most significant components of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated, in thousands and as a percentage of total research and development expenses and provides the changes in these components and their percentages:
908259_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	The reduction in external services expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same twelve month period in 2009 is primarily attributable to a reduction in spending on our ZYBRESTAT for Oncology program of approximately $3.3 million.
908259_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	This reduction is primarily attributable to lower costs on our ATC study for the comparable 2010 period in connection with our decision to discontinue further recruitment of patients on this study in February 2010.
908259_11_ITEM7_P90_S2	In addition, we experienced reductions in expenses on both our OXi4503 and ZYBRESTAT for Ophthalmology programs for the comparable 2010 period, primarily related to our decision in February 2010 to scale back efforts in some of our projects in these areas as well.
908259_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	The reduction in employee compensation and related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same twelve month period of 2009 is due to a 50% reduction in our average full time equivalents for the comparable 2010 period.
908259_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	In February 2010 we implemented a Company-wide restructuring plan due to our decision to scale back activities in some of our ongoing clinical projects.
908259_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	The reduction in other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same twelve month period of 2009 is primarily due to a reduction in both our research and development facility related costs as well as program wide support costs for the comparable 2010 period.
908259_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	The table below summarizes the most significant components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated, in thousands and as a percentage of total general and administrative expenses and provides the changes in these components and their percentages:
908259_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	The reduction in employee compensation and related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same twelve month period of 2009 is due to a reduction in both our average full time equivalents of 16% and expenses in the 2009 period for administrative costs associated with the Symphony ViDA entity that did not recur in the 2010 period.
908259_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	In February 2010, we implemented a Company-wide restructuring plan due to our decision to scale back activities in some of our ongoing clinical projects.
908259_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	The number and scope of our clinical development projects affects how we staff and support those projects.
908259_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	The increase in stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same twelve month period of 2009 is due to timing and vesting periods of option awards to employees.
908259_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	The reduction in consulting and professional services expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same twelve month period of 2009 is primarily due to a reduction in both recurring professional services fees including director and audit fees for the comparable periods as well as one time costs incurred in the 2009 period for corporate wide quality systems reviews and costs incurred in our attempt to acquire VaxGen Inc.
908259_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	that did not recur in the 2010 period.
908259_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	On February 11, 2010, we announced a restructuring plan designed to focus resources on our highest-value clinical assets and reduce our cash utilization.
908259_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	Key aspects of the restructuring and its effects on our current clinical trials are as follows:
908259_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	We continue to advance our high-priority Phase 2 ZYBRESTAT trial in non-small cell lung cancer (FALCON study), with updated safety and efficacy results anticipated for presentation at the upcoming American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in June 2011.
908259_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	We stopped further enrollment in the Phase 2/3 FACT clinical trial in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), but have continued to treat and follow all patients who enrolled in the study.
908259_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	We expect this approach to optimize our ability to gain useful additional insight into ZYBRESTAT s antitumor activity earlier than the previously anticipated timeline, while also reducing cash utilization in 2010 and beyond.
908259_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	We discontinued enrolling patients in our OXi4503 Phase 1b trial in patients with hepatic tumors.
908259_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	We are evaluating the results received to date.
908259_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	We discontinued enrollment in our Phase 2 FAVOR study of ZYBRESTAT in polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), a form of macular degeneration.
908259_11_ITEM7_P103_S1	After completing enrollment in the fall of 2010, we are considering next steps for this program.
908259_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	Future development decisions concerning the OXi4503 program and the ZYBRESTAT for ophthalmology program will be made following these analyses and additional review by our management and board of directors.
908259_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	In addition, we reduced our workforce by 20 employees or approximately 49%.
908259_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	The table below summarizes Other Income and Expense in our Income Statement for the years 2010 and 2009, in thousands.
908259_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	We record unrealized (non cash) gain/(loss) as a result of a change in the estimated Fair Market Value ( FMV ) of our Derivative Liabilities and the common stock warrants issued in connection with our equity offerings as discussed in Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to and Potentially Settled in the Company s Common stock, Note 1 to our financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
908259_11_ITEM7_P107_S1	In 2010, the loss primarily relates to the triggering of the full-ratchet provisions of the PIPE warrants, where the exercise price of each warrant was decreased, causing a greater warrant liability.
908259_11_ITEM7_P107_S2	In 2009, the gain primarily relates to the decline in the underlying fair value of the common stock.
908259_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	The decrease in Investment income of $93,000 for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily a result of a reduction in our average month end cash balance available for investment during the respective periods.
908259_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	The Other income (expense) amounts are derived from our gain and loss on foreign currency exchange and reflect both a change in number of foreign clinical trials and the fluctuation in exchange rates.
908259_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	Also included in the fiscal 2010 amount is our receipt of $733,000 in connection with qualified investments in a qualifying therapeutic discovery project under section 48D of the Internal Revenue Code in November 2010.
908259_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $74,444,000 for U.S. income tax purposes, which begin to expire for U.S. purposes through 2021.
908259_11_ITEM7_P110_S1	Due to the degree of uncertainty related to the ultimate use of these loss carry-forwards, we have fully reserved this future benefit.
908259_11_ITEM7_P110_S2	Additionally, the future utilization of the U.S. net operating loss carry-forwards is subject to limitations under the change in stock ownership rules of the Internal Revenue Service.
908259_11_ITEM7_P110_S3	The valuation allowance increased by approximately $5,640,000 and approximately $8,466,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, due primarily to the increase in net operating loss carry-forwards.
908259_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	We recognized approximately $12,000 in licensing revenue in the year ended December 31, 2008, in connection with the license of our nutritional and diagnostic technology.
908259_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	We did not recognize any license revenue in the year ended December 31, 2009.
908259_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	The following table summarizes our operating expenses for the periods indicated, in thousands and as a percentage of total expenses:
908259_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	The table below summarizes the most significant components of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated, in thousands and as a percentage of total research and development expenses and provides the changes in these components and their percentages:
908259_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	The most significant component of the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 of $3,261,000 was for employee compensation and related expenses.
908259_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	In fiscal 2009, in order to support our multiple worldwide clinical studies, one of which was a registrational study, we experienced an increase in our average headcount of approximately 13 R D employees or approximately 66%.
908259_11_ITEM7_P114_S2	This resulted in increases in salaries, benefits, recruitment costs and travel costs in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008.
908259_11_ITEM7_P114_S3	In addition, we incurred one-time severance expenses of approximately $690,000 primarily associated with two executives who departed the Company in fiscal 2009.
908259_11_ITEM7_P114_S4	The increase in R D headcount described above also contributed to the increase in Facilities and related costs of $165,000 in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008.
908259_11_ITEM7_P114_S5	The decrease in stock based compensation of $153,000 in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was as a result of forfeitures of grants by executives and non-recurring vesting expense in 2009 of restricted stock grants.
908259_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	With regards to the external services component of our research and development expenses, we experienced a decrease of approximately $1,000,000 on our ZYBRESTAT for oncology program in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 as we concluded our Phase 2 trial for the treatment of platinum resistant ovarian cancer and a number of other smaller studies in fiscal 2009.
908259_11_ITEM7_P115_S1	We increased expenditures in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 by approximately $965,000 in our OXi4503 program which includes our Phase I trial of OXi4503 in solid tumors and our Phase I trial of ZYBRESTAT in combination with bevacizumab in solid tumors.
908259_11_ITEM7_P115_S2	We also increased expenditures in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 in our ZYBRESTAT for Ophthalmology program by approximately $1,369,000, primarily attributable to the initiation of our PCV study.
908259_11_ITEM7_P115_S3	The increases in expenditures on our OXi4503 and ZYBRESTAT for Ophthalmology programs were offset by a decrease in Non-clinical expenditures for those programs of approximately $800,000 in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008.
908259_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	The table below summarizes the most significant components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated, in thousands and as a percentage of total general and administrative expenses and provides the changes in these components and their percentages:
908259_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	In fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 general and administrative costs increased $1,943,000.
908259_11_ITEM7_P117_S1	The most significant component of this increase was due primarily to an increase of $1,911,000 in consulting and professional services.
908259_11_ITEM7_P117_S2	In fiscal 2009, we incurred one-time costs of approximately $1,341,000 in connection with our proposed merger with VaxGen.
908259_11_ITEM7_P117_S3	These costs included accounting, legal and printing costs incurred in preparation for the acquisition.
908259_11_ITEM7_P117_S4	In addition, we experienced an increase in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 in legal and other advisory consulting and professional services expenses of approximately $540,000 primarily attributable to an initiative we undertook to review and improve our quality, vendor oversight and regulatory compliance, as well as advisory services in connection with the management of the Symphony ViDA.
908259_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	Employee compensation and related expenses in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 increased by $561,000.
908259_11_ITEM7_P118_S1	This increase is primarily due to severance costs in connection with the departure of our former CEO of approximately $350,000.
908259_11_ITEM7_P118_S2	In addition, our average G A headcount increased in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 by approximately 1, or approximately 6%, which accounted for increases in salaries, benefits and travel costs in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008.
908259_11_ITEM7_P118_S3	The decrease in stock based compensation of $391,000 in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 is primarily a result of forfeitures of options by directors and executives who departed the company in fiscal 2009.
908259_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	The table below summarizes Other Income and Expense in our Statement of Operations for the years 2009 and 2008, in thousands.
908259_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	The decrease in Investment income of $508,000 for fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 is primarily a result of a reduction in our average month end cash balance available for investment and lower average rate of return.
908259_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	We record unrealized (non cash) gain/(loss) as a result of the change in the estimated Fair Market Value ( FMV ) of our Derivative Liabilities and the common stock warrants issued in connection with our equity offerings as discussed in Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to and Potentially Settled in the Company s Common stock, Note 1 to the financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
908259_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	In fiscal 2009, we recorded a gain relating to the change in fair value of outstanding warrants which were accounted for as liabilities of $2,166,000.
908259_11_ITEM7_P122_S1	The change in the fair value of the short-term and long-term direct registration warrants from the date of issue of July 20, 2009 to December 31, 2009 was $1,855,000.
908259_11_ITEM7_P122_S2	The change in fair value of the CEFF Warrant and the additional investment warrants held by Symphony Capital from December 31, 2008 to July 20, 2009, the date on which both instruments were no longer treated as liabilities, was $311,000.
908259_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	In fiscal 2008, we recorded a gain of $3,335,000 relating to the change in fair value of outstanding warrants, which warrants were accounted for as liabilities.
908259_11_ITEM7_P123_S1	The majority of this gain, or $3,312,000, is due to the Direct Investment Warrant issued to Symphony Capital in October 2008 and exercised by them in December 2008 following the approval by our stockholders of the issuance of our common stock underlying the warrant at a special meeting of stockholders on December 9, 2008.
908259_11_ITEM7_P123_S2	The gain represents the change in value between the Direct Investment Warrant issue date and December 30, 2008, the date that the Direct Investment Warrant was exercised.
908259_11_ITEM7_P123_S3	The remainder of the gain reflects the change during the fourth quarter of 2008 in value of the CEFF Warrant issued to Kingsbridge Capital.
908259_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	The Other income (expense) amounts are derived from our gain and loss on foreign currency exchange and reflect both a change in number of foreign clinical trials and the fluctuation in exchange rates.
908259_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	To date, we have financed our operations principally through net proceeds received from private and public equity financings and through our strategic development arrangement with Symphony, which concluded in 2009.
908259_11_ITEM7_P125_S1	We have experienced negative cash flow from operations each year since our inception, except in fiscal 2000.
908259_11_ITEM7_P125_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $207,700,000.
908259_11_ITEM7_P125_S3	We expect to continue to incur increased expenses, resulting in losses, over at least the next several years due to, among other factors, our continuing and planned clinical trials and anticipated research and development activities.
908259_11_ITEM7_P125_S4	We had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately $4,677,000 at December 31, 2010.
908259_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated, in thousands:
908259_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	Non-cash adjustments to net loss in the year ended December 31, 2010 consist primarily of a change in the fair value of warrants and other financial instruments of $6,018,000, and stock-based compensation expense of $952,000 primarily related to the issuance of options to purchase our common stock.
908259_11_ITEM7_P127_S1	The net change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other payables of $4,343,000, offset in part by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $457,000.
908259_11_ITEM7_P127_S2	Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily attributable to the net proceeds of our private placement of common stock and warrants completed in March 2010 and the sale of common stock under our at the market equity financing facility discussed below.
908259_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	On February 11, 2010, we announced a restructuring of our clinical development programs.
908259_11_ITEM7_P128_S1	This restructuring plan is designed to focus our resources on our highest-value clinical assets and reduce our cash utilization.
908259_11_ITEM7_P128_S2	As a part of this restructuring we stopped further enrollment in our Phase 2/3 anaplastic thyroid cancer clinical trial (FACT) and reduced our work force by approximately 49% (20 employees).
908259_11_ITEM7_P128_S3	In addition, the further development of our ongoing clinical trials will depend on upcoming analysis and results of these ongoing clinical studies and our cash resources at that time.
908259_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	We incurred a charge in connection with the reduction of our work force of approximately $510,000 in the first quarter of 2010 for severance pay and benefits to those former employees affected by the reduction.
908259_11_ITEM7_P129_S1	This re-alignment of priorities in clinical programs together with reductions in force reduced the cash required to operate our business to between $3,500,000 and $4,500,000 per quarter in the second half of 2010.
908259_11_ITEM7_P129_S2	As our current ongoing trials proceed to completion, we expect the per quarter cash requirement to continue to decline to the $2,500,000 to $3,000,000 range over the course of 2011.
908259_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	On March 11, 2010, we completed a definitive agreement with certain institutional investors to sell shares of our common stock and four separate series of warrants to purchase common stock in a private placement.
908259_11_ITEM7_P130_S1	Gross proceeds of the financing were approximately $7,500,000, before deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses, and excluding the subsequent exercises of the warrants.
908259_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	The four separate series of warrants consisted of the following:
908259_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	(B) Series B Warrants to initially purchase 328,947 shares of common stock, which were initially exercisable at a per share exercise price of $22.80, on the earlier of the six month anniversary of the closing date or the date on which our stockholders approve the issuance of shares in the transaction, and expired on the later of three months from the effective date of the resale registration statement covering such shares and seven months from the closing date.
908259_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	(D) Series D Warrants to purchase shares of common stock.
908259_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	The Series D Warrants were not immediately exercisable.
908259_11_ITEM7_P134_S1	We registered for resale 337,757 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Series D Warrants pursuant to an agreement with the warrant holders.
908259_11_ITEM7_P134_S2	All of the Series D Warrants were exercised by November 4, 2010 and there are no Series D Warrants outstanding after that date.
908259_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	The Series A, B and C warrants listed above contained full ratchet anti-dilution features based on the price and terms of any financings completed after March 11, 2010 as described in the warrant agreements.
908259_11_ITEM7_P135_S1	As set forth in the table below, the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Series A, B and C warrants increased substantially and the per share exercise price has decreased substantially, as a result of the operation of these features.
908259_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	than thirty trading days, as determined individually by each holder of Series D Warrants.
908259_11_ITEM7_P136_S1	The first of these pricing periods occurred from July 1, 2010 to August 11, 2010.
908259_11_ITEM7_P136_S2	The second of these pricing periods occurred from September 11, 2010 to October 22, 2010.
908259_11_ITEM7_P137_S0	The Series D warrant provided that if during the applicable pricing period, the arithmetic average of the seven lowest closing bid prices of the common stock (as reported on the NASDAQ Stock Market) is less than the purchase price in the offering ($22.80), each holder s Series D Warrants shall become exercisable for an additional number of shares pursuant to a formula set forth in the Purchase Agreement.
908259_11_ITEM7_P137_S1	Since the arithmetic average of such prices was below $22.80 per share during the applicable pricing periods, the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Series D warrants increased substantially as set forth in the table below.
908259_11_ITEM7_P138_S0	All of the warrants listed above contained a cashless exercise feature as described in the warrant agreements.
908259_11_ITEM7_P139_S0	The following is a summary of the adjusted number of warrants from the original amounts issued for each of the series of warrants for the year ended December 31, 2010 as a result of the operation of the full ratchet anti-dilution provisions of such warrants and the exercise activity in those warrants for the same period (in thousands, except for the Adjusted Exercise Price):
908259_11_ITEM7_P140_S0	On January 18, 2011, we, entered into separate Warrant Exchange Agreements with each of the holders of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock issued in March 2010, pursuant to which, at the initial closing, the warrant holders exchanged their outstanding Series A and Series C warrants having ratchet price-based anti-dilution protections for (A) an aggregate of 1,096,933 shares of common stock and (B) Series E Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,222,623 shares of common stock.
908259_11_ITEM7_P140_S1	The Series E Warrants are not exercisable for six months, have an exercise price of $4.60 per share (reflecting the market value of the shares of common stock as of the close of trading on January 18, 2011, prior to the entry into the Warrant Exchange Agreements), and do not contain any price-based anti-dilution protections.
908259_11_ITEM7_P140_S2	In addition, the Company agreed to seek shareholder approval to issue up to 457,544 additional shares of common stock to the warrant holders in a subsequent closing.
908259_11_ITEM7_P140_S3	In the event such shareholder approval is obtained, the Series E Warrants issued at the initial closing shall be exchanged for the additional 457,544 shares of common stock.
908259_11_ITEM7_P140_S4	The initial closing occurred on January 20, 2011, and the subsequent closing is expected to take place on or about March 18, 2011, following the stockholder meeting that has been scheduled for that date to approve the additional share issuance.
908259_11_ITEM7_P140_S5	Our expectation is that the completion of this exchange could enhance the potential to attract additional equity capital as well as help in our efforts to remain compliant with Nasdaq listing requirements.
908259_11_ITEM7_P141_S0	On July 21, 2010, we entered into an at the market (ATM) equity offering sales agreement with McNicoll, Lewis Vlak LLC, or MLV, pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through MLV acting as our sales agent and underwriter.
908259_11_ITEM7_P141_S1	Sales of our common stock through MLV, are made on the principal trading market of our common stock by means of ordinary brokers transactions at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by MLV and us.
908259_11_ITEM7_P141_S2	MLV uses its commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock from time to time, based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits we may impose).
908259_11_ITEM7_P141_S3	We pay MLV a commission rate of up to 7.0% of the gross sales price per share of any common stock sold through MLV as agent under the sales agreement.
908259_11_ITEM7_P141_S4	We have also provided MLV with customary indemnification rights.
908259_11_ITEM7_P142_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company sold 664,150 shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM sales agreement resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $3,806,000.
908259_11_ITEM7_P143_S0	In January 2011, we sold the remaining 48,350 shares resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $180,000.
908259_11_ITEM7_P144_S0	On January 31, 2011 we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $4,790,000 under the ATM.
908259_11_ITEM7_P144_S1	Currently, the ATM is our only source of capital to enable the continuation of our operations.
908259_11_ITEM7_P145_S0	On July 20, 2009, we raised approximately $10,000,000 in gross proceeds, before deducting placement agents fees and other offering expenses, in a registered direct offering relating to the sale of 312,500 units, each unit consisting of (i) one share of common stock, (ii) a five-year warrant to purchase 0.45 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $42.00 per share of common stock and (iii) a short-term warrant to purchase 0.45 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $32.00 per share of common stock.
908259_11_ITEM7_P145_S1	The short-term warrants are exercisable during a period beginning on the date of issuance until the later of (a) nine months from the date of issuance and (b) ten trading days after the earlier of (i) the public announcement of the outcome of the planned interim analysis by the Independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee of data from our Phase 2/3 pivotal clinical trial regarding ZYBRESTAT as a treatment for anaplastic thyroid cancer or (ii) the public announcement of the suspension, termination or abandonment of such trial for any reason.
908259_11_ITEM7_P146_S0	The net proceeds to us from the sale of the units, after deducting the fees of the placement agents and other offering expenses, were approximately $9,029,000.
908259_11_ITEM7_P147_S0	The following table summarizes the number of shares of our common stock issued and the proceeds received from such sales during the year ended December 31, 2010:
908259_11_ITEM7_P148_S0	Shares have been issued to our directors under the Director Compensation policy as compensation for their board and committee services.
908259_11_ITEM7_P149_S0	In November 2010, we received a total of $732,000 for qualified investments in a qualifying therapeutic discovery project under section 48D of the Internal Revenue Code.
908259_11_ITEM7_P150_S0	We expect cash on hand, plus the proceeds of potential sales of our common stock pursuant to the sales agreement with MLV to fund our operations through the second quarter of 2011.
908259_11_ITEM7_P150_S1	No assurance can be given that we will sell any additional shares under the sales agreement, or, if we do, as to the price or amount of shares that we will sell, or the dates on which any such sales will take place.
908259_11_ITEM7_P151_S0	In order to remain a going concern beyond the second quarter of 2011, we will require significant funding.
908259_11_ITEM7_P151_S1	Additional funds to finance our operations may not be available on terms that we deem acceptable, or at all.
908259_11_ITEM7_P151_S2	Our ability to raise additional capital could also be impaired if our common shares lose their status on The NASDAQ Capital Market, and trade in the over-the-counter market.
908259_11_ITEM7_P151_S3	These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
908259_11_ITEM7_P152_S0	The Report of Independent Registered Accounting Firm at the beginning of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of this Form 10-K includes a going concern explanatory paragraph.
908259_11_ITEM7_P153_S0	clinical trial programs; the costs and expenses of filing, prosecuting and, if necessary, enforcing our patent claims, or defending against possible claims of infringement by third-party patent or other technology rights; the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, if any, undertaken by us; and, if and when approved, the demand for our products, which demand depends in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known, understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval, including the range of indications for which any product is granted approval.
908259_11_ITEM7_P154_S0	If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we will not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we will be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs or cease operations.
908259_11_ITEM7_P154_S1	We may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements.
908259_11_ITEM7_P154_S2	Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_11_ITEM7_P155_S0	If we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish, on terms that are not favorable to us, rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize.
908259_11_ITEM7_P155_S1	Our failure to raise capital when needed will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_11_ITEM7_P156_S0	The following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010 in thousands:
908259_11_ITEM7_P157_S0	Payments under clinical development and related commitments are based on the completion of activities as specified in the contract.
908259_11_ITEM7_P157_S1	The amounts in the table above assume the successful completion, by the third-party contractor, of all of the activities contemplated in the agreements.
908259_11_ITEM7_P158_S0	Our primary drug development programs are based on a series of natural products called Combretastatins.
908259_11_ITEM7_P158_S1	In August 1999, we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by Arizona State University.
908259_11_ITEM7_P158_S2	This agreement was subsequently amended in June 2002.
908259_11_ITEM7_P158_S3	From the inception of the agreement through December 31, 2010, we have paid a total of $2,500,000 in connection with this license.
908259_11_ITEM7_P158_S4	The agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals, which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones, as defined in the agreement.
908259_11_ITEM7_P158_S5	The license agreement also provides for additional payments upon our election to develop certain additional compounds, as defined in the agreement.
908259_11_ITEM7_P158_S6	Future milestone payments under this agreement could total $200,000.
908259_11_ITEM7_P158_S7	We are also required to pay royalties on future net sales of products associated with these patent rights.
908259_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	At December 31, 2010, we did not hold any derivative financial instruments, commodity-based instruments or other long-term debt obligations.
908259_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We have accounted for the warrants issued in connection with our equity offerings as liabilities as of December 31, 2010.
908259_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We have adopted an Investment Policy, the primary objectives of which are to preserve principal, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields while preserving principal.
908259_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Although our investments are subject to credit risk, we follow procedures to limit the amount of credit exposure in any single issue, issuer or type of investment.
908259_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase.
908259_11_ITEM7A_P1_S3	However, due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration, we believe that interest rate risk is mitigated.
908259_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Although we conduct a number of our trials and studies outside of the United States, we believe our exposure to foreign currency risk to be limited as the arrangements are in jurisdictions with relatively stable currencies.
908259_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	See Item 15 for a list of our Financial Statements and Schedules and Supplementary Information filed as part of this Annual Report.
908259_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission requires that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Chief Executive Officer, CEO, and the Chief Financial Officer, CFO, evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and report on the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
908259_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of December 31, 2010, to ensure that we record, process, summarize and report the information we must disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
908259_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, identified in connection with the evaluation of such control that occurred during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
908259_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
908259_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
908259_11_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.
908259_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
908259_11_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this Annual Report.
908259_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud.
908259_11_ITEM9A_P5_S0	are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time.
908259_11_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.
908259_11_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Because as of June 30, 2010 the Company s public float value was below $75,000,000, Ernst Young LLP was not required to issue an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting and, therefore, did not perform for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 an audit of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.

908259_11_ITEM15_P0_S0	The following consolidated financial statements of OXiGENE, Inc. are included in Item 8:
908259_11_ITEM15_P1_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders of OXiGENE, Inc.
908259_11_ITEM15_P2_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of OXiGENE, Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders (deficit) equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010.
908259_11_ITEM15_P2_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
908259_11_ITEM15_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
908259_11_ITEM15_P3_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
908259_11_ITEM15_P3_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
908259_11_ITEM15_P3_S2	We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
908259_11_ITEM15_P3_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
908259_11_ITEM15_P3_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
908259_11_ITEM15_P4_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
908259_11_ITEM15_P4_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
908259_11_ITEM15_P4_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
908259_11_ITEM15_P5_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of OXiGENE, Inc. at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
908259_11_ITEM15_P6_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that OXiGENE, Inc. will continue as a going concern.
908259_11_ITEM15_P6_S1	As more fully described in Note 1, the Company has incurred recurring operating losses and will be required to raise additional capital, alternative means of financial support, or both, prior to January 1, 2012 in order to sustain operations.
908259_11_ITEM15_P6_S2	The ability of the Company to raise additional capital or alternative sources of financing is uncertain.
908259_11_ITEM15_P6_S3	These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
908259_11_ITEM15_P6_S4	Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1.
908259_11_ITEM15_P7_S0	The 2010 consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
908259_11_ITEM15_P8_S0	OXiGENE, Inc. (the Company ), incorporated in 1988 in the state of New York and reincorporated in 1992 in the state of Delaware, is a clinical-stage, biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics to treat cancer and eye diseases.
908259_11_ITEM15_P8_S1	OXiGENE s primary focus is the development and commercialization of product candidates referred to as vascular disrupting agents, or VDAs, that selectively disable and destroy abnormal blood vessels that provide solid tumors a means of growth and survival and also are associated with visual impairment in a number of ophthalmological diseases and conditions.
908259_11_ITEM15_P8_S2	To date, more than 400 subjects have been treated with ZYBRESTAT in human clinical trials, and the drug candidate has generally been observed to be well-tolerated.
908259_11_ITEM15_P8_S3	Currently, the Company does not have any products available for sale; however, it has two therapeutic product candidates in various stages of clinical and pre-clinical development, as well as additional product candidates currently in research and development.
908259_11_ITEM15_P9_S0	OXiGENE s primary drug development candidates, ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503, are based on a series of natural products called Combretastatins, and are VDAs.
908259_11_ITEM15_P9_S1	The Company is currently developing its VDA drug candidates for indications in both oncology and ophthalmology.
908259_11_ITEM15_P9_S2	OXiGENE s most advanced drug candidate is ZYBRESTAT, a VDA, which is being evaluated in multiple ongoing and planned clinical trials in various oncology and ophthalmic indications.
908259_11_ITEM15_P10_S0	The Company conducts scientific activities pursuant to collaborative arrangements with universities.
908259_11_ITEM15_P10_S1	Regulatory and clinical testing functions are generally contracted out to third-party, specialty organizations.
908259_11_ITEM15_P11_S0	In February 2011, the Company s board of directors voted unanimously to implement a 1:20 reverse stock split of the Company s common stock, following authorization of the reverse split by a shareholder vote on December 21, 2010.
908259_11_ITEM15_P11_S1	The reverse split became effective on February 22, 2011.
908259_11_ITEM15_P11_S2	All of the share and per share amounts, except for the per share fair value amounts, discussed and shown in the consolidated financial statements and notes have been adjusted to reflect the effect of this reverse split.
908259_11_ITEM15_P11_S3	In the first quarter of OXiGENE s fiscal 2011, the Company will revalue all of its derivative liability and equity instruments that use the Black Scholes method of valuation effective as of the date of the reverse split.
908259_11_ITEM15_P11_S4	The change in value of such instruments will be recorded as a gain or loss in the Company s statement of operations in the first quarter.
908259_11_ITEM15_P11_S5	These gains or losses could be substantial.
908259_11_ITEM15_P12_S0	To date, OXiGENE has financed its operations principally through net proceeds received from private and public equity financings.
908259_11_ITEM15_P12_S1	The Company s cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents balance as of December 31, 2010 was $4,677,000.
908259_11_ITEM15_P13_S0	On March 11, 2010 the Company completed a definitive agreement with certain institutional investors to sell 328,947 shares of its common stock and four separate series of warrants to purchase common stock in a private placement.
908259_11_ITEM15_P13_S1	Gross proceeds of the financing were approximately $7,500,000, before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses, and excluding the subsequent exercises of the warrants.
908259_11_ITEM15_P14_S0	On July 21, 2010, the Company entered into an at the market (ATM) equity offering sales agreement with McNicoll, Lewis Vlak LLC, or MLV, pursuant to which it may issue and sell shares of its common stock from time to time through MLV acting as sales agent and underwriter.
908259_11_ITEM15_P14_S1	Sales of the Company s common stock through MLV, if any, are made on the Company s principal trading market by means of ordinary brokers transactions at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by MLV and the Company.
908259_11_ITEM15_P15_S0	MLV uses its commercially reasonable efforts to sell the Company s common stock from time to time, based upon instructions from the Company (including any price, time or size limits the Company may impose).
908259_11_ITEM15_P15_S1	The Company pays MLV a commission rate of up to 7.0% of the gross sales price per share of any common stock sold through MLV as agent under the sales agreement.
908259_11_ITEM15_P15_S2	The Company has also provided MLV with customary indemnification rights.
908259_11_ITEM15_P16_S0	common stock pursuant to the ATM sales agreement resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $3,806,000.
908259_11_ITEM15_P16_S1	As of December 31, 2010, there were 48,350 shares remaining available for sale under the ATM, based on the number of shares registered to be sold.
908259_11_ITEM15_P16_S2	In January 2011, OXiGENE sold the remaining 48,350 shares resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $180,000.
908259_11_ITEM15_P17_S0	On January 31, 2011, the Company filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which it may issue and sell additional shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $4,790,000 under the ATM.
908259_11_ITEM15_P18_S0	In November 2010, the Company received $732,000 for qualified investments in a qualifying therapeutic discovery project under section 48D of the Internal Revenue Code.
908259_11_ITEM15_P18_S1	This amount is recorded within Other income in the 2010 Consolidated Statement of Operations.
908259_11_ITEM15_P19_S0	OXiGENE s ongoing capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including: the progress and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials of its product candidates under development, including ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503; the progress of its research and development programs; the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals; the resources, if any, that the Company devotes to develop manufacturing methods and advanced technologies; OXiGENE s ability to enter into licensing arrangements, including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable it to continue the Company s development and clinical trial programs; the costs and expenses of filing, prosecuting and, if necessary, enforcing OXiGENE s patent claims, or defending against possible claims of infringement by third-party patent or other technology rights; the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, if any, undertaken by the Company; and, if and when approved, the demand for OXiGENE s products, which demand depends in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known, understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval, including the range of indications for which any product is granted approval.
908259_11_ITEM15_P20_S0	The Company expects its existing cash and cash equivalents to support the Company s operations through the first quarter of 2011.
908259_11_ITEM15_P20_S1	Assuming that net proceeds from the potential sale of shares at current market prices under the ATM sales agreement described above are received ratably over the March 2011 to June 2011 timeframe, the Company expects that its existing financial resources, together with the expected net proceeds from the ATM, would be sufficient to fund its operations through the second quarter of 2011.
908259_11_ITEM15_P20_S2	No assurance can be given that the Company will sell any additional shares under the ATM sales agreement, or, if it does, as to the price or amount of shares that it will sell, or the dates on which any such sales will take place.
908259_11_ITEM15_P21_S0	The Company is aggressively pursuing other forms of capital infusion including public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements with organizations that have capabilities and/or products that are complementary to the Company s own capabilities and/or products, in order to continue the development of its product candidates.
908259_11_ITEM15_P22_S0	OXiGENE will need to access additional funds to remain a going concern beyond the first quarter of 2011 or, if funds are raised through the ATM sales agreement as described above, beyond the second quarter of 2011.
908259_11_ITEM15_P22_S1	Such funding may not be available to OXiGENE on acceptable terms, or at all.
908259_11_ITEM15_P22_S2	If the Company is unable to access additional funds when needed, it may not be able to continue the development of its product candidates or the Company could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of its development programs and other operations.
908259_11_ITEM15_P22_S3	Any additional equity financing, if available to the Company, may not be available on favorable terms, most likely will be dilutive to its current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_11_ITEM15_P22_S4	If the Company accesses funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, it may be required to relinquish rights to some of its technologies or product candidates that it would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on its own, on terms that are not favorable to the Company.
908259_11_ITEM15_P22_S5	The Company s ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, will materially harm its business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_11_ITEM15_P22_S6	The Company s ability to raise additional capital could also be impaired if its common shares lose their status on The NASDAQ Capital Market, and trade in the over-the-counter market.
908259_11_ITEM15_P23_S0	doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
908259_11_ITEM15_P24_S0	The Report of Independent Registered Accounting Firm at the beginning of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of this Form 10-K includes a going concern explanatory paragraph.
908259_11_ITEM15_P25_S0	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
908259_11_ITEM15_P26_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
908259_11_ITEM15_P26_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
908259_11_ITEM15_P27_S0	The Company has no significant off balance sheet concentrations of credit risk.
908259_11_ITEM15_P27_S1	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents.

908259_11_ITEM15_P92_S4	In connection with the CEFF, the Company issued a warrant to Kingsbridge to purchase 12,500 shares of its common stock at a price of $54.80 per share exercisable beginning six months after February 19, 2008 and for a period of five years thereafter.
908259_11_ITEM15_P92_S5	As of December 31, 2010, there remain a total of 253,671 shares available for sale under the CEFF.
908259_11_ITEM15_P93_S0	Due to the initially indeterminate number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants issued in connection with the Company s private placement on March 11, 2010, OXiGENE concluded that the CEFF warrants should be recorded as a liability effective with the date of the private placement.
908259_11_ITEM15_P93_S1	The fair value of the warrants on this date was reclassified from equity to derivative liabilities.
908259_11_ITEM15_P93_S2	Changes in the fair market value from the date of the private placement to the reporting date were recorded as a gain or loss in Change in fair value of warrants and other financial instruments in the Statement of Operations.
908259_11_ITEM15_P93_S3	The Company established the fair value of the CEFF warrants using the Black-Scholes option valuation model as reflected in the table below:
908259_11_ITEM15_P94_S0	( Direct Registration Series I ) to purchase 0.45 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $42.00 per share of common stock and (iii) a short-term warrant ( Direct Registration Series II ) to purchase 0.45 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $32.00 per share of common stock (the Units ).
908259_11_ITEM15_P95_S0	as a treatment for anaplastic thyroid cancer or (ii) the public announcement of the suspension, termination or abandonment of such trial for any reason.
908259_11_ITEM15_P95_S1	On September 12, 2010, the Company announced interim results from its anaplastic thyroid cancer study and therefore the short-term Direct Registration Series II warrants expired ten trading days later on September 24, 2010, without being exercised.
908259_11_ITEM15_P96_S0	The units were offered and sold pursuant to (i) a prospectus dated December 1, 2008 and (ii) a prospectus supplement dated July 15, 2009, pursuant to and forming a part of the Company s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-155371).
908259_11_ITEM15_P96_S1	The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the Units, after deducting the fees of the placement agents and other offering expenses, were approximately $9,029,000.
908259_11_ITEM15_P97_S0	OXiGENE determined that the Direct Registration Series I and II warrants should be classified as a liability as they require delivery of registered shares of common stock and thus could require net-cash settlement in certain circumstances.
908259_11_ITEM15_P97_S1	Accordingly, these warrants were recorded as a liability at their fair value as of the date of their issuance and are revalued at each subsequent reporting date.
908259_11_ITEM15_P98_S0	The fair value of the direct registration warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation model applying the following assumptions:
908259_11_ITEM15_P99_S0	The Company s 2005 Stock Plan provides for the award of options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights to acquire up to 375,000 shares of the Company s common stock.
908259_11_ITEM15_P100_S0	but which became or will become unissued upon the cancellation, surrender or termination of such award.
908259_11_ITEM15_P100_S1	Currently, the 2005 Plan allows for awards of up to 37,500 shares that may be granted to any participant in any fiscal year.
908259_11_ITEM15_P101_S0	Options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant, generally vest over a period of two to four years and expire ten years from the date of grant.
908259_11_ITEM15_P101_S1	For options subject to graded vesting, the Company elected the straight-line method of expensing these awards over the service period.
908259_11_ITEM15_P102_S0	The following is a summary of the Company s stock option activity under its 1996 Plan and 2005 Plan for the year ended December 31, 2010:
908259_11_ITEM15_P103_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, 9,800 options expired.
908259_11_ITEM15_P103_S1	As of December 31, 2010 there was approximately $10,146,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards that is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of 3.15 years.
908259_11_ITEM15_P104_S0	The following stock options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:
908259_11_ITEM15_P105_S0	The fair values for the stock options granted were estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for the three years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:
908259_11_ITEM15_P106_S0	In calculating the estimated fair value of our stock options, the Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires the consideration of the following six variables for purposes of estimating fair value:
908259_11_ITEM15_P107_S0	the risk free interest rate for the expected option term.
908259_11_ITEM15_P108_S0	The closing market price of its common stock on the date of grant.
908259_11_ITEM15_P109_S0	The expected term of options represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on an analysis of historical behavior of participants over time.
908259_11_ITEM15_P110_S0	The expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Company s stock price is expected to fluctuate during the term of the option granted.
908259_11_ITEM15_P110_S1	OXiGENE determines the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of its common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term.
908259_11_ITEM15_P111_S0	Expected Dividends Because OXiGENE has never declared or paid any cash dividends on any of its common stock and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future, the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option.
908259_11_ITEM15_P112_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury issues with a remaining life consistent with the option s expected term on the date of grant.
908259_11_ITEM15_P113_S0	The Company is required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
908259_11_ITEM15_P113_S1	This requirement applies to all awards that are not yet vested, including awards granted prior to January 1, 2006.
908259_11_ITEM15_P113_S2	Accordingly, OXiGENE performed a historical analysis of option awards that were forfeited prior to vesting, and ultimately recorded total stock option expense that reflected this estimated forfeiture rate.
908259_11_ITEM15_P113_S3	In the Company s calculation, it segregated participants into two distinct groups, (1) directors and officers and (2) employees, and OXiGENE s estimated forfeiture rates were calculated at 25% and 50%, respectively using the straight line method.
908259_11_ITEM15_P113_S4	This analysis will be re-evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary.
908259_11_ITEM15_P114_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had 1,000 shares of non-vested restricted common stock outstanding, issued at a grant price of $81.80.
908259_11_ITEM15_P115_S0	The Company recorded expense of approximately $82,000, $242,000 and $393,000 related to outstanding restricted stock awards during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
908259_11_ITEM15_P115_S1	The 1,000 shares of unvested restricted common stock at December 31, 2010 will vest in June 2011.
908259_11_ITEM15_P115_S2	The restricted stock awards were valued based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on their respective grant dates.
908259_11_ITEM15_P115_S3	Compensation expense is being recognized on a straight -line basis over the 4 year vesting period of the awards.
908259_11_ITEM15_P116_S0	In May 2009, the Company s stockholders approved the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 2009 ESPP ).
908259_11_ITEM15_P116_S1	Under the 2009 ESPP, employees have the option to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at 85% of the closing price on the first day of each purchase period or the last day of each purchase period (as defined in the 2009 ESPP), whichever is lower, up to specified limits.
908259_11_ITEM15_P116_S2	Eligible employees are given the option to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, on a tax-favored basis, through regular payroll deductions in compliance with Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
908259_11_ITEM15_P117_S0	adjustment each year pursuant to the terms of the 2009 ESPP.
908259_11_ITEM15_P117_S1	The Company recorded expense relating to the 2009 ESPP for years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 of $8,000 and $50,000, respectively.
908259_11_ITEM15_P118_S0	Pursuant to the 2009 ESPP provisions, each year beginning in 2010 there will be an annual increase in the number of shares available for issuance under the ESPP on the first day of the new year in an amount equal to the lesser of: 25,000 shares or 5% of the shares of Common stock outstanding on the last day of the preceding fiscal year.
908259_11_ITEM15_P119_S0	employee directors of the Company, to provide an inducement to obtain and retain the services of qualified persons to serve as members of the Company s Board of Directors.
908259_11_ITEM15_P119_S1	Under this plan, the Company issued 180,000 shares as compensation for Board and committee service in 2009 to each member of the Board.
908259_11_ITEM15_P119_S2	Each of the Company s non-employee Directors was also granted 500 fully vested shares of common stock on January 2, 2010 as additional compensation for services previously rendered to the Company during 2009, and 1,250 fully vested shares of common stock on each of January 2, 2010 and July 1, 2010 as compensation for services rendered in 2010.
908259_11_ITEM15_P119_S3	The Company recorded expense for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, of $257,000 and $321,000, respectively for these shares.
908259_11_ITEM15_P120_S0	In February 2010, the Company implemented a restructuring plan in which it terminated 20 full-time employees, or approximately 49% of its work force.
908259_11_ITEM15_P120_S1	The purpose of the restructuring was to focus the Company s resources on its highest-value clinical assets and reduce its cash utilization.
908259_11_ITEM15_P120_S2	The restructuring expenses include severance payments, health and medical benefits and related taxes, which were paid through August 2010.
908259_11_ITEM15_P120_S3	No amounts remain outstanding as of December 31, 2010.
908259_11_ITEM15_P120_S4	The Company incurred severance and related costs of $458,000 for research and development employees and $52,000 for administrative employees in connection with this restructuring in fiscal 2010.
908259_11_ITEM15_P121_S0	On October 1, 2008, OXiGENE announced a strategic collaboration with Symphony Capital Partners, L.P. a private-equity firm that agreed to provide funding to support the advancement of ZYBRESTAT for oncology, ZYBRESTAT for ophthalmology and OXi4503.
908259_11_ITEM15_P121_S1	Under this collaboration, the Company entered into a series of related agreements with Symphony Capital LLC, or Symphony, Symphony ViDA, Inc., or ViDA, Symphony ViDA Holdings LLC, or Holdings, and related entities.
908259_11_ITEM15_P122_S0	Pursuant to these agreements, Holdings had formed and capitalized ViDA, a Delaware corporation, in order (a) to hold certain intellectual property related to two of OXiGENE s product candidates, ZYBRESTAT for use in ophthalmologic indications and OXi4503, referred to as the Programs, which were exclusively licensed to ViDA under the Novated and Restated Technology License Agreement and (b) to fund commitments of up to $25,000,000.
908259_11_ITEM15_P122_S1	The funding supported pre-clinical and clinical development by OXiGENE, on behalf of ViDA, for the Programs.
908259_11_ITEM15_P123_S0	As part of a series of related agreements with Holdings, on October 1, 2008, Holdings purchased $15,000,000 worth of shares of common stock at a price of $22.20 per share, which was equal to the closing price of the Company s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on September 30, 2008, via a direct investment.
908259_11_ITEM15_P124_S0	restated purchase option agreement (the Amended Purchase Option Agreement ).
908259_11_ITEM15_P124_S1	In connection with such amendment, OXiGENE and Holdings also entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement.
908259_11_ITEM15_P125_S0	Under the Amended Purchase Option Agreement, OXiGENE issued 500,000 newly-issued shares of OXiGENE common stock in exchange for all of the equity of ViDA which included further consideration for additional securities issued in connection with the July 2009 Registered Direct Offering.
908259_11_ITEM15_P125_S1	The Company re-acquired all of the rights to the Programs that had been licensed in 2008 to ViDA.
908259_11_ITEM15_P125_S2	In addition, the approximately $12,400,000 in cash and marketable securities held by ViDA was transferred to OXiGENE.
908259_11_ITEM15_P126_S0	OXiGENE recorded the acquisition of ViDA as a capital transaction and the $10,383,000 excess of the fair market value of the common shares issued by OXiGENE ($15,600,000) over the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest ($5,217,000) was reflected directly in equity as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital.
908259_11_ITEM15_P126_S1	As a result, the noncontrolling interest balance was eliminated.
908259_11_ITEM15_P126_S2	The reduction to Additional paid-in capital was also presented as an increase in the loss applicable to common stock within the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
908259_11_ITEM15_P127_S0	OXiGENE consolidated the financial position and results of operations of Symphony ViDA, Inc. from October 2008, when it entered into a strategic collaboration with Symphony ViDA Holdings, LLC, until July 20, 2009 when OXiGENE acquired 100% of ViDA pursuant to an Amended and Restated Purchase Option Agreement.
908259_11_ITEM15_P127_S1	The funding supported pre-clinical and clinical development by OXiGENE, on behalf of ViDA, for ZYBRESTAT for ophthalmology and OXi4503.
908259_11_ITEM15_P128_S0	Basic and diluted net loss per share was calculated by dividing the net loss per share attributed to OXIGENE common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
908259_11_ITEM15_P128_S1	Diluted net loss per share includes the effect of all dilutive, potentially issuable common equivalent shares as defined using the treasury stock method.
908259_11_ITEM15_P128_S2	All of the Company s common stock equivalents are anti-dilutive due to the Company s net loss position for all periods presented.
908259_11_ITEM15_P128_S3	Accordingly, common stock equivalents of approximately 3,354,000, 391,000 and 136,000 at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares for diluted net loss per share.
908259_11_ITEM15_P129_S0	During 2009, the Company recorded the excess of the purchase price over the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest in ViDA as an increase in the loss applicable to common stock (See Symphony Transaction above).
908259_11_ITEM15_P130_S0	ASC 220, Comprehensive Income, establishes rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components and requires unrealized gains or losses on the Company s available-for-sale securities and the foreign currency translation adjustments to be included in other comprehensive loss.
908259_11_ITEM15_P130_S1	Comprehensive loss was the same as the reported net loss for the year ended December 31, 2010.
908259_11_ITEM15_P131_S0	A reconciliation of comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 is as follows:
908259_11_ITEM15_P132_S0	In October 2008, the Board of Directors accepted the resignation of Dr. Richard Chin from his position as President and Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors.
908259_11_ITEM15_P132_S1	All unvested options held by Dr. Chin were forfeited as of January 22, 2009 and no further severance payments were required.
908259_11_ITEM15_P133_S0	In April 2009, the Company entered into a separation agreement with Patricia Walicke, M.D., Ph.D., its former Vice President and Chief Medical Officer.
908259_11_ITEM15_P133_S1	Pursuant to the separation agreement, Dr. Walicke, received severance payments in the amount of $300,000 made in equal installments over one year.
908259_11_ITEM15_P133_S2	All unvested options held by Dr. Walicke were forfeited as of July 29, 2009 and no further severance payments are required.
908259_11_ITEM15_P134_S0	In October 2009, the Board of Directors accepted the resignation of John A. Kollins as Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the Board of Directors.
908259_11_ITEM15_P134_S1	The Company entered into a separation agreement with Mr. Kollins effective as of November 5, 2009.
908259_11_ITEM15_P134_S2	Mr. Kollins received his base salary of $350,000 made in equal installments for one year plus health benefits for up to 2 years, and a one time $20,000 payment.
908259_11_ITEM15_P134_S3	All unvested options held by Mr. Kollins were forfeited as of January 8, 2010.
908259_11_ITEM15_P135_S0	After consideration of the available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company has determined that a full valuation allowance at December 31, 2010 and 2009, is necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.
908259_11_ITEM15_P135_S1	The valuation allowance increased by approximately $5,640,000 and approximately $8,466,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, due primarily to the increase in federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards.
908259_11_ITEM15_P136_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $203,314,000 for U.S. income tax purposes, which will begin to expire in 2021 and state operating loss carry-forwards of $66,723,000 in Massachusetts that begin expiring in 2011 and $32,163,000 in California that begin to expire in 2028.
908259_11_ITEM15_P136_S1	The Company also had tax credits of $2,687,000 related to federal and state research and development activities which begin to expire in 2021.
908259_11_ITEM15_P136_S2	The Company recorded a capital loss carryover of approximately $4,000,000 in 2009 that generated a deferred tax asset of $1,575,000.
908259_11_ITEM15_P137_S0	The future utilization of the net operating loss carry-forwards and credit carry-forwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership changes that could have occurred in the past or that may occur in the future under the provisions of IRC Section 382 or 383 of the internal revenue code.
908259_11_ITEM15_P138_S0	The Company has not, as yet, conducted a study of its research and development credit carry-forwards.
908259_11_ITEM15_P138_S1	This study may result in an adjustment to the Company s research and development credit carry-forwards, however, until a study is completed and any adjustment is known, no amounts are presented as an uncertain tax position.
908259_11_ITEM15_P138_S2	A full valuation allowance has been provided against the Company s research and development credits and if an adjustment is required, this adjustment would be offset by any adjustment to the deferred tax asset established for the research and development credit carry-forward and the valuation allowance.
908259_11_ITEM15_P139_S0	In 2010, the Company received $733,000 in tax credit grants under the U.S. Government s Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Project for qualified research and development expenses.
908259_11_ITEM15_P139_S1	These proceeds have been recognized as other income.
908259_11_ITEM15_P140_S0	The Company provides for income taxes under the liability method in accordance with the FASB s guidance on accounting for income taxes.
908259_11_ITEM15_P140_S1	As all of the Company s deferred tax assets have been reserved for in a valuation allowance, no provision for (benefit from) income taxes have been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
908259_11_ITEM15_P141_S0	A reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the Company s effective tax rate is as follows:
908259_11_ITEM15_P142_S0	The provisions of FIN 48 (as codified under ASC 740), were adopted by the Company on January 1, 2007.
908259_11_ITEM15_P143_S0	ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
908259_11_ITEM15_P143_S1	ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
908259_11_ITEM15_P144_S0	financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
908259_11_ITEM15_P144_S1	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits.
908259_11_ITEM15_P145_S0	There are currently no federal or state audits in progress, tax years still subject to examination for Federal and the State of Massachusetts and California authorities include all prior years due to the existence of net operating loss carry-forwards.
908259_11_ITEM15_P145_S1	However, the statute of limitation for assessment by the internal revenue service and state authorities is only open for tax years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009.
908259_11_ITEM15_P146_S0	In November 2008, the Company executed a lease for a total of approximately 12,300 square feet of office space located in South San Francisco, California.
908259_11_ITEM15_P146_S1	The lease agreement is for an estimated 52 months.
908259_11_ITEM15_P146_S2	In May 2010, the Company executed a lease for approximately 3,900 square feet in Waltham, Massachusetts.
908259_11_ITEM15_P147_S0	During 2008, 2009 and for the first five months of 2010, the Company occupied approximately 11,000 square feet in Waltham, Massachusetts and approximately 600 square feet in Oxford, UK.
908259_11_ITEM15_P148_S0	The Company sponsors a savings plan available to all domestic employees, which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
908259_11_ITEM15_P148_S1	Employees may contribute to the plan from 1% to 20% of their pre-tax salary subject to statutory limitations.
908259_11_ITEM15_P149_S0	Annually the Board of Directors determines the amount of the Company match.
908259_11_ITEM15_P149_S1	The Company provided a match of $92,000, for the year ended December 31, 2008 only.
908259_11_ITEM15_P150_S0	On January 18, 2011, OXiGENE, entered into separate Warrant Exchange Agreements with each of the holders of warrants to purchase shares of common stock, issued in March 2010, pursuant to which, at the initial closing, the warrant holders exchanged their outstanding Series A and Series C warrants having ratchet price-based anti-dilution protections for (A) an aggregate of 1,096,933 shares of common stock and (B) Series E Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,222,623 shares of common stock.
908259_11_ITEM15_P150_S1	The Series E Warrants are not exercisable for six months, have an exercise price of $4.60 per share (reflecting the market value of the shares of common stock as of the close of trading on January 18, 2011, prior to the entry into the Warrant Exchange Agreements), and do not contain any price-based anti-dilution protections.

908259_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	Important factors that we believe may cause such differences are discussed in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report and in the cautionary statements accompanying the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report.
908259_12_ITEM7_P2_S3	In assessing forward-looking statements contained herein, readers are urged to read carefully all Risk Factors and cautionary statements contained in this Annual Report.
908259_12_ITEM7_P2_S4	Further, we operate in an industry sector where securities values are volatile and may be influenced by regulatory and other factors beyond our control.
908259_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	We are a clinical-stage, biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics primarily to treat cancer.
908259_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	Our primary focus is the development of product candidates referred to as vascular disrupting agents, or VDAs, that selectively disable and destroy abnormal blood vessels that provide solid tumors a means of growth and survival and also are associated with visual impairment in a number of ophthalmological diseases and conditions.
908259_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	We intend to primarily target the development of our product candidates for the treatment of rare cancers that will be eligible for orphan drug status from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA.
908259_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our lead candidate, ZYBRESTAT, has been awarded orphan drug status by the FDA and the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer, or ATC, and for the treatment of medullary, Stage IV papillary and Stage IV follicular thyroid cancers.
908259_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	The FDA has also granted Fast Track status to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of regionally advanced and/or metastatic ATC, as well as in ovarian cancer.
908259_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Orphan Drug Act was passed in January 1983 to stimulate the research, development, and approval of products that treat rare diseases.
908259_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	An orphan drug is defined as a product that treats a rare disease affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States.
908259_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Drugs are granted orphan status for a specific indication.
908259_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	To date, more than 400 subjects have been treated with ZYBRESTAT in human clinical trials, and the drug candidate has generally been observed to be well-tolerated.
908259_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	ZYBRESTAT for Oncology ZYBRESTAT is a reversible tubulin binding agent that works by disrupting the network of blood vessels, or vasculature, within solid tumors, also referred to as vascular disruption.
908259_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	Vascular disruption leads to tumor hypoxia, which refers to the process of starving the tumor of vitally necessary oxygen supply and subsequent tumor cell death.
908259_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	More specifically, ZYBRESTAT selectively targets the existing abnormal and largely immature vasculature found specifically in most solid tumors and causes endothelial cells that make up the walls of the blood vessels in that vasculature to lose their normally flat shape and to become round, thus blocking the flow of blood to the tumor.
908259_12_ITEM7_P8_S3	The downstream tumor environment is then deprived of oxygen and nutrients, and the resulting restriction in blood supply kills the cells in the central portion of the tumor.
908259_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Based on ZYBRESTAT s positive activity observed in animal models, we have conducted multiple clinical trials of ZYBRESTAT in a variety of tumor types.
908259_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our top priority is to pursue the clinical development of ZYBRESTAT in ATC.
908259_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	ATC is a very aggressive, rare but lethal cancer of the thyroid gland.
908259_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	Because of the rapid progression of the disease and the absence of effective therapies, median survival from the time of diagnosis is approximately 3-4 months.
908259_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	We have completed a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of ZYBRESTAT in patients with ATC, and we are currently planning a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of ZYBRESTAT in ATC, which we refer to as the FACT 2 trial.
908259_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	We believe that the FACT 2 trial represents a critical opportunity to demonstrate the value of our key asset, ZYBRESTAT, and has the potential to create significant value for our company and our shareholders.
908259_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	As such, our primary corporate strategy for 2012 is to secure sufficient funding to conduct the trial.
908259_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	We also intend to pursue a special protocol assessment (SPA) for this program with the FDA, with the goal of laying the foundation for initiation of this global registration study.
908259_12_ITEM7_P11_S4	We believe completion of the FACT2 study, assuming continued positive clinical results, will be sufficient to obtain FDA approval and approval in Europe for the treatment of patients with advanced ATC.
908259_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Possible areas for future development ATC and ovarian cancer, and potentially other orphan indications, represent areas for further development and significant unmet medical needs, and thus significant potential commercial market opportunities.
908259_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	Further development of our ongoing clinical trials will depend on continuing analysis and results of ongoing clinical studies, as well as available financial resources and/or potential partnering activities.
908259_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	OXi4503, a unique, second generation VDA for oncology indications We are currently pursuing development of OXi4503, a second-generation, dual-mechanism VDA, as a treatment for certain solid tumor types and for the treatment of myeloid leukemias, which also represent orphan indications.
908259_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	We believe that OXi4503 is differentiated from other VDAs by its dual-action activity: in addition to having potent vascular disrupting effects, OXi4503 is unique in that certain enzymes in the human body can help convert it to a form of chemical that has direct tumor cell killing effects.
908259_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	We believe this unique property may result in enhanced anti-tumor activity in certain tumor types as compared with other VDA drug candidates.
908259_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Based on data from preclinical studies, we believe that OXi4503 may have enhanced activity in tumor types with relatively high levels of the enzymes that facilitate the conversion of OXi4503 to the form of chemical that kills tumor cells.
908259_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	These tumor types include hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, and leukemias of the myeloid lineage.
908259_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	In preclinical studies, OXi4503 has shown potent anti-tumor activity against solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia models, both as a single agent and in combination with other cancer treatment modalities.
908259_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Based on the results of preclinical studies published in the journal Blood in September 2010 that show OXi4503 has potent activity against acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in animal models, we entered into a clinical trial agreement pursuant to which investigators at the University of Florida initiated an investigator sponsored Phase 1 study of OXi4503 in patients with AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in May 2011.
908259_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	This open-label, dose-escalating study for the treatment of up to 36 patients is being conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory AML and MDS and will evaluate the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose and biologic activity of OXi4503 in these patients.
908259_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	We expect that initial indications of biologic activity from this study may be available in the fourth quarter of 2012.
908259_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	The general direction of future development of OXi4503 for hematologic indications will depend on the outcome of the analysis of the study in AML, as well as available financial resources and potential partnering activities.
908259_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	In addition to developing ZYBRESTAT as an intravenously administered therapy for oncology indications, we have previously undertaken an ophthalmology research and development program with ZYBRESTAT with the ultimate goal of developing a topical formulation of ZYBRESTAT for ophthalmological diseases and conditions that are characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth within the eye that result in loss of vision.
908259_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	Due to financial constraints, we are not actively pursuing development in this area at this time.
908259_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	We believe that a safe, effective and convenient topically-administered anti-vascular therapeutic would have advantages over currently approved anti-vascular, ophthalmological therapeutics, many of which must be injected directly into patients eyes, in some cases on a chronic monthly basis.
908259_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	We have also evaluated the requirements for additional preclinical toxicology and efficacy studies with ZYBRESTAT for topical ophthalmological formulations to better position the program for partnering.
908259_12_ITEM7_P17_S4	Further development of this program will depend on the outcome of our evaluation of these requirements and available financial resources.
908259_12_ITEM7_P17_S5	Financial Resources We have experienced net losses every year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2011, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $217,353,000.
908259_12_ITEM7_P17_S6	We expect to incur significant additional operating losses over at least the next several years, principally as a result of our continuing clinical trials and anticipated research and development expenditures.
908259_12_ITEM7_P17_S7	The principal source of our working capital to date has been the proceeds of private and public equity financings and to a lesser extent the exercise of warrants and stock options.
908259_12_ITEM7_P17_S8	We currently have no recurring material amount of licensing or other income.
908259_12_ITEM7_P17_S9	As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $9,992,000 in cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents.
908259_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	On July 21, 2010, we entered into an at the market (ATM) equity offering sales agreement with McNicoll, Lewis Vlak LLC, (MLV), pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through MLV acting as our sales agent and underwriter.
908259_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	Sales of our common stock through MLV are made on the principal trading market of our common stock by means of ordinary brokers transactions at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by MLV and us.
908259_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	MLV uses its commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock from time to time, based upon our instructions including any price, time or size limits we may impose.
908259_12_ITEM7_P18_S3	We pay MLV a commission rate of up to 7.0% of the gross sales price per share of any common stock sold through MLV as agent under the sales agreement.
908259_12_ITEM7_P18_S4	During our fiscal year 2011, we sold approximately 7,794,000 shares of our common stock using this arrangement for net proceeds of approximately $17,146,000.
908259_12_ITEM7_P18_S5	Currently, we are not able to sell additional shares under this ATM due to SEC limitations on the number of shares issuable pursuant to a Form S-3 registration statement in a primary offering by smaller reporting companies such as us.
908259_12_ITEM7_P18_S6	We expect to be able to resume such sales in the second half of 2012, should we meet the issuance criteria of the SEC and NASDAQ.
908259_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	On September 1, 2011, we announced a restructuring plan, which included employee terminations, designed to focus our capital resources on our most promising early-stage clinical programs and further reduce our cash utilization.
908259_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	We announced the following key aspects of the restructuring and their effects on our operations including current and planned clinical trials:
908259_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	At this time, a Company sponsored Phase 3 registrational study of ZYBRESTAT in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) funded entirely by internal financial resources is not feasible.
908259_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	We intend to continue to explore options for conducting such a study, including potential collaborations with national and international head and neck cancer cooperative groups.
908259_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	Future development decisions concerning ZYBRESTAT in patients with ATC will be made following a review of all options by our management and our board of directors.
908259_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	We have concluded the final analysis of our completed Phase 2 study of ZYBRESTAT in conjunction with standard chemotherapy and bevacizumab in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (FALCON study).
908259_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	Any future development decisions concerning the study of ZYBRESTAT in patients with NSCLC will depend on our financial resources.
908259_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	We continue to support the ongoing randomized Phase 2 trial of ZYBRESTAT in combination with bevacizumab in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer, which is an NCI-sponsored study being conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG), an organization dedicated to clinical research in the field of gynecologic cancer.
908259_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	We continue to support of the ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 1 trial of OXi4503 in patients with AML or myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, being conducted at the University of Florida and with support by The Leukemia Lymphoma Society s Therapy Acceleration Program.
908259_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	We are evaluating additional early-stage development opportunities for our two product candidates, ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503, subject to available resources.
908259_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	We reduced our workforce by 11 full-time equivalent employees or approximately 61%.
908259_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	As of March 9, 2012, we had a total of eight full-time employees and approximately three full-time equivalent employees working on a part-time basis.
908259_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	We are seeking to reduce the amount of space we currently rent, primarily by closing our office in Waltham, Massachusetts no later than the lease expiration in May 2012 and by conducting our operations only out of our South San Francisco office as soon as practicable.
908259_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	We offered severance benefits to the terminated employees, and have recorded a total charge of approximately $1,226,000, primarily associated with personnel-related termination costs.
908259_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	In order to provide for an orderly transition, we implemented the reduction in work force in a phased manner.
908259_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Substantially all of the charge represents cash expenditures.
908259_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	Upon completion of the restructuring activities outlined above, we expect to reduce expenses from fiscal 2011 levels by an annual amount of approximately $2,000,000.
908259_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	Our ability to achieve this anticipated cost reduction is contingent upon only continuing to conduct the projects for which we are currently committed.
908259_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	Based on this planned level of cash utilization, we will be unable to significantly advance our more developed candidates, including ZYBRESTAT in ATC.
908259_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	In November 2011, we entered into a purchase agreement for the sale, from time to time, of up to $20,000,000 of our common stock with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (LPC), a Chicago-based institutional investor.
908259_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	The proceeds from any sales under this purchase agreement will be used to further develop our late and early-stage clinical pipeline and to fund our ongoing operations.
908259_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	During the 36-month term of the purchase agreement, we control the timing and amount of any sales to LPC, if and when we decide, in accordance with the purchase agreement.
908259_12_ITEM7_P28_S3	LPC has no right to require us to sell any shares to LPC, but LPC is obligated to make purchases as we direct, subject to certain conditions, which include the continuing effectiveness of a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering the resale of the shares that may be issued to LPC and limitations related to the market value of our common stock.
908259_12_ITEM7_P28_S4	There is no guarantee that funding from LPC will be available when needed, or at all, or that the Company will be able to maintain effectiveness of the aforementioned registration statement.
908259_12_ITEM7_P28_S5	There are no upper limits to the price LPC may pay to purchase our common stock and the purchase price of the shares related to any future sales will be based on the prevailing market prices of our shares immediately preceding the notice of sale to LPC without any fixed discount.
908259_12_ITEM7_P28_S6	The agreement may be terminated by us at any time, at our sole discretion, without any cost or penalty.
908259_12_ITEM7_P28_S7	No amounts were received under this facility during 2011.
908259_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	In December 2011, we established a partnership agreement with Azanta Danmark A/S, or Azanta, to provide access to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of patients in a specified territory with ATC on a compassionate use basis.
908259_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	Our newly-formed Named Patient Program to be managed by Azanta, provides a regulatory mechanism to allow healthcare professionals in Europe and Canada to prescribe ZYBRESTAT to individual ATC patients while it is still in development.
908259_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	Under the terms of the agreement, we will provide ZYBRESTAT to Azanta.
908259_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	the territory covered by the agreement until such time as ZYBRESTAT may obtain marketing approval in that territory.
908259_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	The territory includes the European Union, including the Nordic countries and Switzerland, and Canada, and the agreement may also be expanded to include other countries on a country-by-country basis.
908259_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	We and Azanta will cooperate on regulatory activities relating to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of ATC within the territory.
908259_12_ITEM7_P30_S3	There will be no transfer of ownership of intellectual property rights for ZYBRESTAT to Azanta under the terms of the agreement.
908259_12_ITEM7_P30_S4	We do not expect to receive significant income from Azanta under this arrangement.
908259_12_ITEM7_P30_S5	No revenue was recognized nor was any cash received under this agreement during 2011.
908259_12_ITEM7_P30_S6	Based on our limited ongoing programs and operations and taking into consideration the expected reductions in cash utilization resulting from our September 2011 reduction in force, we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents to support our operations through the first quarter of 2013.
908259_12_ITEM7_P30_S7	However, this level of cash utilization does not provide for the initiation of any significant projects to further the development of our most advanced product candidates, primarily ZYBRESTAT in ATC.
908259_12_ITEM7_P30_S8	Any significant further development of ZYBRESTAT or other capital intensive activities will be contingent upon our ability to raise additional capital in addition to our existing financing arrangements.
908259_12_ITEM7_P30_S9	We will require significant additional funding to fund operations and to continue the development of our product candidates.
908259_12_ITEM7_P30_S10	Such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
908259_12_ITEM7_P30_S11	If we are unable to access additional funds when needed, we may not be able to continue the development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations.
908259_12_ITEM7_P30_S12	Any additional equity financing, which may not be available to us or may not be available on favorable terms, most likely will be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_12_ITEM7_P30_S13	If we access funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own, on terms that are not favorable to us.
908259_12_ITEM7_P30_S14	Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_12_ITEM7_P30_S15	We are committed to a disciplined financial strategy and as such maintain a limited employee and facilities base, with development, scientific, finance and administrative functions, which include, among other things, product development, regulatory oversight and clinical testing.
908259_12_ITEM7_P30_S16	Our research and development team members typically work on a number of development projects concurrently.
908259_12_ITEM7_P30_S17	Accordingly, we do not separately track the costs for each of these research and development projects to enable separate disclosure of these costs on a project-by-project basis.
908259_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	We conduct scientific activities pursuant to collaborative arrangements with universities.
908259_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	Regulatory and clinical testing functions are generally contracted out to third-party, specialty organizations.
908259_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
908259_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
908259_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to intangible assets.
908259_12_ITEM7_P32_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
908259_12_ITEM7_P32_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
908259_12_ITEM7_P32_S5	While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements included in this report, we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.
908259_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
908259_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
908259_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk We have no significant off balance sheet concentrations of credit risk.
908259_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents.
908259_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	We hold our cash and cash equivalents at one financial institution.
908259_12_ITEM7_P34_S3	We consider all highly liquid financial instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
908259_12_ITEM7_P34_S4	We have $20,000 that is used to secure financing through a Company credit card.
908259_12_ITEM7_P34_S5	This amount is separated from cash and cash equivalents on the Balance Sheet.
908259_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	We charge all research and development expenses, both internal and external costs, to operations as incurred.
908259_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	Our research and development costs represent expenses incurred from the engagement of outside professional service organizations, product manufacturers and consultants associated with the development of our potential product candidates.
908259_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	We recognize expense associated with these arrangements based on the completion of activities as specified in the applicable contracts.
908259_12_ITEM7_P35_S3	Costs incurred under fixed fee contracts are accrued ratably over the contract period absent any knowledge that the services will be performed other than ratably.
908259_12_ITEM7_P35_S4	Costs incurred under contracts with clinical trial sites and principal investigators are generally accrued on a patients-treated basis consistent with the terms outlined in the contract.
908259_12_ITEM7_P35_S5	In determining costs incurred on some of these programs, we take into consideration a number of factors, including estimates and input provided by our internal program managers.
908259_12_ITEM7_P35_S6	Upon termination of such contracts, we are normally only liable for costs incurred or committed to date.
908259_12_ITEM7_P35_S7	As a result, accrued research and development expenses represent our estimated contractual liability to outside service providers at any of the relevant times.
908259_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	Any advance payments for goods or services to be used or rendered in future research and development activities pursuant to an executory contractual arrangement are properly classified as prepaid until such goods or services are rendered.
908259_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	License Agreements On August 2, 1999, we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by Arizona State University.
908259_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	The present value of the amount payable under the license agreement has been capitalized based on a discounted cash flow model and is being amortized over the term of the agreement (approximately 15.5 years).
908259_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Management is required to perform an impairment analysis of its long-lived assets if triggering events occur.
908259_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	We review for such triggering events, including triggering events such as a going concern opinion and continuing operating losses, periodically.
908259_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	In addition, the agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals, which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones as defined in the agreement.
908259_12_ITEM7_P38_S3	We expense these payments to research and development in the period that payment becomes both probable and estimable.
908259_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Share-based compensation We record the expense recognition of the estimated fair value of all share-based payments issued to employees.
908259_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	The valuation of employee stock options is an inherently subjective process, since market values are generally not available for long-term, non-transferable employee stock options.
908259_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	Accordingly, an option pricing model is utilized to derive an estimated fair value.
908259_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	In calculating the estimated fair value of our stock options, we used the Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires the consideration of the following six variables for purposes of estimating fair value:
908259_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	the risk free interest rate for the expected option term.
908259_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	The closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant.
908259_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	The expected term of options represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on an analysis of historical behavior of participants over time.
908259_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	The expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the term of the option granted.
908259_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	We determine the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term.
908259_12_ITEM7_P43_S3	Expected Dividends Because we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on any of our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future, we use an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option.
908259_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury issues with a remaining life consistent with the option s expected term on the date of grant.
908259_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Of the variables above, the selection of an expected term and expected stock price volatility are the most subjective.
908259_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	We are required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
908259_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	Accordingly, we perform a historical analysis of option awards that are forfeited prior to vesting, and record total stock option expense that reflects this estimated forfeiture rate.
908259_12_ITEM7_P45_S3	We segregate participants into two distinct groups, (1) directors and officers and (2) employees, and apply the estimated forfeiture rates using the Straight Line (Uniform) method to record expense.
908259_12_ITEM7_P45_S4	This analysis is re-evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate adjusted as necessary.
908259_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	In October 2008, we announced a strategic collaboration with Symphony Capital Partners, L.P. (Symphony), a private-equity firm, under which Symphony agreed to provide up to $40,000,000 in funding to support the advancement of ZYBRESTAT for oncology, ZYBRESTAT for ophthalmology and OXi4503.
908259_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	In connection with the collaboration, we granted Symphony ViDA, Inc., a newly-created drug development company, exclusive licenses to ZYBRESTAT for use in ophthalmologic indications and OXi4503.
908259_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	Under the collaboration, we entered into a series of related agreements with Symphony Capital LLC, Symphony ViDA, Symphony ViDA Holdings LLC (Holdings) and related entities, including a Purchase Option Agreement, a Research and Development Agreement, a Technology License Agreement and an Additional Funding Agreement.
908259_12_ITEM7_P46_S3	In addition, we entered into a series of related agreements with Holdings, including a Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement and a Registration Rights Agreement.
908259_12_ITEM7_P46_S4	Pursuant to these agreements, Holdings formed and capitalized Symphony ViDA in order (a) to hold certain intellectual property related to the programs which were exclusively licensed to Symphony ViDA under the Technology License Agreement and (b) to fund commitments of up to $25,000,000.
908259_12_ITEM7_P46_S5	The funding was intended to support preclinical and clinical development by us, on behalf of Symphony ViDA, of the programs.
908259_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	We issued to Holdings, pursuant to the Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement, an aggregate of 675,675 shares of our common stock and warrants at a price of $22.20 per share, which was the closing price of our common stock on September 30, 2008, the day before we entered into the Symphony transaction.
908259_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	In addition, pursuant to the Purchase Option Agreement, we issued to Holdings an aggregate of 180,180 shares of our common stock with a fair value of $4,000,000 as consideration for the Purchase Option.
908259_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	On July 2, 2009, we, Holdings and Symphony ViDA entered into a series of related agreements pursuant to which we exercised the Purchase Option under terms set forth in an amended and restated purchase option agreement (the Amended Purchase Option Agreement), and we and Holdings also entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement.
908259_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	We closed on the amended Purchase Option on July 20, 2009 and issued 500,000 shares of our common stock to Holdings at the closing in exchange for all of the equity of Symphony ViDA.
908259_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	In addition, upon the closing of the Purchase Option, we re-acquired all of the rights to the programs, and the approximately $12,400,000 in cash held by Symphony ViDA at the time of the closing became available for use for general corporate purposes.
908259_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	Consolidation of Variable Interest Entity (VIE) A variable interest entity (VIE) is (1) an entity that has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or (2) an entity that has equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity s operations or that do not absorb their proportionate share of the expected losses or do not receive the expected residual returns of the entity.
908259_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	A VIE should be consolidated by the party that is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, which is the party that has exposure to a majority of the potential variability in the VIE s outcomes.
908259_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	The application of accounting policy to a given arrangement requires significant management judgment.
908259_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	We consolidated the financial position and results of operations of Symphony ViDA, Inc. ( ViDA ) from October 2008, when it entered into a strategic collaboration with Symphony ViDA Holdings, LLC ( Symphony ), until July 20, 2009 when we acquired 100% of ViDA pursuant to the Amended Purchase Option Agreement.
908259_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	We believe ViDA was by design a VIE because we had a purchase option to acquire its outstanding voting stock at prices that are fixed based upon the date the option is exercised.
908259_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	The fixed nature of the purchase option price limited Symphony ViDA Holding s returns, as the investor in ViDA.
908259_12_ITEM7_P51_S3	Further, due to the direct investment from Holdings in our common stock, as a related party ViDA was a VIE of which we were the primary beneficiary.
908259_12_ITEM7_P51_S4	After we exercised the purchase option, ViDA became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours and ceased being a VIE.
908259_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	Accounting and Reporting of Noncontrolling Interests On January 1, 2009, we adopted (retrospectively for all periods presented) the new presentation requirements for noncontrolling interests required by ASC 810, Consolidations.
908259_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	Under ASC 810, earnings or losses attributed to the noncontrolling interests are reported as part of consolidated earnings and not as a separate component of income or expense.
908259_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	Accordingly, we reported the consolidated earnings of ViDA in its consolidated statement of operations from October 2008, when we entered into a strategic collaboration with Symphony, until July 20, 2009, when we acquired 100% of the equity of ViDA pursuant to the Amended Purchase Option Agreement.
908259_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	Once becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary, the operating results of ViDA continued to be included in our consolidated statement of operations but were no longer subject to the presentation requirements applicable to noncontrolling interests.
908259_12_ITEM7_P52_S4	Losses incurred by ViDA, and attributable to Symphony, were charged to noncontrolling interest.
908259_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to and Potentially Settled in the Company s Common stock We evaluate all derivative financial instruments issued in connection with our equity offerings when determining the proper accounting treatment for such instruments in the Company s financial statements.
908259_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	The Company considers a number of generally accepted accounting principles to determine such treatment.
908259_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	The Company performs a number of steps to evaluate the features of the instrument against the guidance provided in the accounting pronouncements in order to determine the appropriate accounting treatment.
908259_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	The Company s policy with regard to settling outstanding financial instruments is to settle those with the earliest maturity date first which essentially sets the order of preference for settling the awards.
908259_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	In the majority of circumstances, we utilize the Black Scholes method to determine the fair value of our derivative financial instruments.
908259_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	In some cases, where appropriate, we utilize the Binomial method to determine the fair value of such derivative financial instruments.
908259_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	Key valuation factors in determining the fair value include the current stock price as of the date of measurement, the exercise price, the remaining contractual life, expected volatility for the instrument and the risk-free interest rate.
908259_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	Changes in fair value are recorded as a gain or loss in our Statement of Operations with the corresponding amount recorded as an adjustment to the liability on our Balance Sheet.
908259_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	The expected volatility factor, in particular, is subject to significant variability from measurement period to measurement period and can result in large gains or losses from period to period.
908259_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	In December 2011, we established a partnership agreement with Azanta Danmark A/S, or Azanta, to provide access to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of patients in a specified territory with ATC on a compassionate use basis.
908259_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	Our newly-formed Named Patient Program to be managed by Azanta, provides a regulatory mechanism to allow healthcare professionals in Europe and Canada to prescribe ZYBRESTAT to individual ATC patients while it is still in development.
908259_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	Our agreement with Azanta provides that upon the receipt of ZYBRESTAT by Azanta for distribution and sale to compassionate use patients, Azanta has 30 days to inspect the product for defects and to ensure that the product conforms to the warranties made by us.
908259_12_ITEM7_P58_S3	If Azanta does not notify us of any defective product within the 30-day period it will be deemed to have accepted the product.
908259_12_ITEM7_P58_S4	Revenue is recognized based on product accepted at the conclusion of the 30-day inspection period.
908259_12_ITEM7_P58_S5	Also, Azanta will pay to us, on a quarterly basis, an amount equal to 20% of Azanta s gross margin, as defined in the agreement, on its sales in the preceding quarter.
908259_12_ITEM7_P58_S6	This revenue will be recognized upon notification from Azanta of the gross margin earned.
908259_12_ITEM7_P58_S7	In addition, we licensed to a third party our formerly owned Nicoplex and Thiol Test technology.
908259_12_ITEM7_P58_S8	Revenue in connection with this license arrangement is earned based on sales of products or services utilizing this technology.
908259_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	Revenue is recognized under this agreement when payments are received due to the uncertainty of the timing of sales of products or services.
908259_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 Revenues We did not recognize any license revenue in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
908259_12_ITEM7_P59_S2	Future revenues, if any, from license agreements are expected to be minimal.
908259_12_ITEM7_P59_S3	In addition, we did not recognize any product revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 in connection with our distribution agreement with Azanta as no product had been accepted by Azanta as of December 31, 2011.
908259_12_ITEM7_P59_S4	Our future revenues will depend upon our ability to establish collaborations with respect to, and generate revenues from products currently under development by us.
908259_12_ITEM7_P59_S5	We expect that we will not generate meaningful revenue unless and until we enter into new collaborations providing for funding through the payment of licensing fees and up-front payments.
908259_12_ITEM7_P59_S6	Costs and Expenses The following table summarizes our operating expenses for the periods indicated, in thousands and as a percentage of total expenses:
908259_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	Research and development expenses The table below summarizes the most significant components of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated, in thousands and as a percentage of total research and development expenses and provides the changes in these components and their percentages: The reduction in external services expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same twelve month period in 2010 is primarily attributable to a reduction in spending on all of our clinical projects for the comparable periods with the majority of the reduction coming from our ZYBRESTAT for oncology program, most prominently our anaplastic thyroid cancer and non-small cell lung cancer projects.
908259_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	These two major studies have been progressing to conclusion over the last 12 to 18 months.
908259_12_ITEM7_P60_S2	In addition, we experienced reductions in expenses on our OXi4503 and ZYBRESTAT for ophthalmology programs for the comparable 2011 period, primarily related to our decision in February 2010 to scale back efforts on some of our projects in these areas.
908259_12_ITEM7_P60_S3	The reduction in employee compensation and related expenses for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same twelve month period of 2010 is due to reductions in our clinical project expenses noted above.
908259_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	In February 2010 and again in September 2011, we implemented a Company wide restructuring plan due to our decision to scale back activities in some of our ongoing clinical projects.
908259_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	The reduction in other expenses for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same twelve month period of 2010 is primarily due to a reduction in both our research and development facility related costs as well as program wide support costs for the comparable periods.
908259_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	General and administrative expenses The table below summarizes the most significant components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated, in thousands and as a percentage of total general and administrative expenses and provides the changes in these components and their percentages:
908259_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	The reduction in employee compensation and related expenses for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same twelve month period of 2010 is due to a reduction in our average full time equivalents for the comparable periods.
908259_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	In February 2010 and again in September 2011, we implemented a Company wide restructuring plan due to our decision to scale back activities in some of our ongoing clinical projects.
908259_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	The reduction in consulting and professional services expenses for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same twelve month period of 2010 is primarily due to one time costs incurred in 2010 in connection with both our attempt to acquire Vaxgen Inc. and to a PIPE financing transaction that did not recur in the 2011 period.
908259_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	In addition, we experienced lower board member compensation expense attributable to lower stock valuations during the first half of the 2011 period as a portion of fees to board members are paid in the form of non-cash stock awards.
908259_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	Also, we recognized lower legal, accounting and service provider expenses due to fewer significant transactions during the 2011 period.
908259_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	On September 1, 2011, we announced a restructuring plan, which included employee terminations, designed to focus our capital resources on our most promising early-stage clinical programs and further reduce our cash utilization.
908259_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	We announced the following key aspects of the restructuring and their effects on our operations including current and planned clinical trials:
908259_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	At this time, a Company sponsored Phase 3 registrational study of ZYBRESTAT in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) funded entirely by internal financial resources is not feasible.
908259_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	We intend to continue to explore options for conducting such a study, including obtaining financing from external sources as well as potential collaborations with national and international head and neck cancer cooperative groups.
908259_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	Future development decisions concerning ZYBRESTAT in patients with ATC will be made following a review of all options by our management and our board of directors.
908259_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	We have concluded the final analysis of our completed Phase 2 study of ZYBRESTAT in conjunction with standard chemotherapy and bevacizumab in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (FALCON study).
908259_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	Any future development decisions concerning the study of ZYBRESTAT in patients with NSCLC will depend on our financial resources.
908259_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	We continue to support the ongoing randomized Phase 2 trial of ZYBRESTAT in combination with bevacizumab in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer, which is an NCI-sponsored study being conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG), an organization dedicated to clinical research in the field of gynecologic cancer.
908259_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	We continue to support of the ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 1 trial of OXi4503 in patients with AML or myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, being conducted at the University of Florida and with support by The Leukemia Lymphoma Society s Therapy Acceleration Program.
908259_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	We are evaluating additional early-stage development opportunities for our two product candidates, ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503, subject to available resources at the time.
908259_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	We reduced our workforce by 11 full-time equivalent employees or approximately 61%.
908259_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	As of March 9, 2012, we had a total of eight full-time employees and approximately three full-time equivalent employees working on a part-time basis.
908259_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	We are seeking to reduce the amount of space we currently rent, primarily by closing our office in Waltham, Massachusetts no later than the lease expiration in May 2012 and by conducting our operations only out of our South San Francisco office as soon as practicable.
908259_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	We offered severance benefits to the terminated employees, and have recorded a total charge of approximately $1,226,000, primarily associated with personnel-related termination costs.
908259_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	In order to provide for an orderly transition, we implemented the reduction in work force in a phased manner.
908259_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	Substantially all of the charge represents cash expenditures.
908259_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	Upon completion of the restructuring activities outlined above, we expect to reduce expenses from fiscal 2011 levels by an annual amount of approximately $2,000,000.
908259_12_ITEM7_P73_S2	Our ability to achieve this anticipated cost reduction is contingent upon only continuing to conduct the projects for which we are currently committed.
908259_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	On February 11, 2010, we announced a restructuring plan designed to focus resources on our highest-value clinical assets and reduce our cash utilization.
908259_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	Key aspects of the 2010 restructuring were as follows:
908259_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	We continued to advance our high-priority Phase 2 ZYBRESTAT trial in non-small cell lung cancer (FALCON study), with a focus on the presentation of updated safety and efficacy results anticipated for presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in June 2011.
908259_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	We stopped further enrollment in the Phase 2/3 FACT clinical trial in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), but continued to treat and follow all patients who enrolled in the study.
908259_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	We discontinued enrolling patients in our OXi4503 Phase 1b trial in patients with hepatic tumors.
908259_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	We discontinued enrollment in our Phase 2 FAVOR study of ZYBRESTAT in polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), a form of macular degeneration.
908259_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	In addition, we reduced our workforce by 20 employees or approximately 49%.
908259_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	Other Income and Expenses The table below summarizes Other Income and Expense in our Income Statement for the years 2011 and 2010, in thousands.
908259_12_ITEM7_P79_S2	We recorded a non-cash gain in the 2011 twelve month period and a non-cash loss in the 2010 twelve month period as a result of changes in the estimated Fair Market Value of our common stock warrants issued in connection with the offerings as discussed in the Warrants section of Note 6 to the financial statements.
908259_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	The Other income amounts are generally derived from net gains on foreign currency exchange.
908259_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	Also included in the fiscal 2010 amount is our receipt of $733,000 in connection with qualified investments in a qualifying therapeutic discovery project under section 48D of the Internal Revenue Code in November 2010.
908259_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	The table below summarizes the components of the change in fair value of warrants for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, in thousands.
908259_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	Tax Matters At December 31, 2011, the Company had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $71,405,000 for U.S. income tax purposes, which began to expire for U.S. purposes during 2011.
908259_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	Due to the degree of uncertainty related to the ultimate use of these loss carry-forwards, we have fully reserved this future benefit.
908259_12_ITEM7_P82_S2	Additionally, the future utilization of the U.S. net operating loss carry-forwards is subject to limitations under the change in stock ownership rules of the Internal Revenue Service.
908259_12_ITEM7_P82_S3	The valuation allowance decreased by approximately $2,854,000 and increased by approximately $5,640,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, due primarily to changes in net operating loss carry-forwards.
908259_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	Years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 Revenues We did not recognize any license revenue in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, in connection with the license of our nutritional and diagnostic technology or otherwise.
908259_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	Future revenues, if any, from this license agreement are expected to be minimal.
908259_12_ITEM7_P83_S2	Our future revenues will depend upon our ability to establish collaborations with respect to, and generate revenues from products currently under development by us.
908259_12_ITEM7_P83_S3	We expect that we will not generate meaningful revenue unless and until we enter into new collaborations providing for funding through the payment of licensing fees and up-front payments.
908259_12_ITEM7_P83_S4	Costs and Expenses The following table summarizes our operating expenses for the periods indicated, in thousands and as a percentage of total expenses: Research and development expenses The table below summarizes the most significant components of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated, in thousands and as a percentage of total research and development expenses and provides the changes in these components and their percentages: The reduction in external services expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same twelve month period in 2009 is primarily attributable to a reduction in spending on our ZYBRESTAT for Oncology program of approximately $3,300,000.
908259_12_ITEM7_P83_S5	This reduction is primarily attributable to lower costs on our ATC study for the comparable 2010 period in connection with our decision to discontinue further recruitment of patients on this study in February 2010.
908259_12_ITEM7_P83_S6	In addition, we experienced reductions in expenses on both our OXi4503 and ZYBRESTAT for Ophthalmology programs for the comparable 2010 period, primarily related to our decision in February 2010 to scale back efforts in some of our projects in these areas as well.
908259_12_ITEM7_P83_S7	The reduction in employee compensation and related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same twelve month period of 2009 is due to a 50% reduction in our average full time equivalents for the comparable 2010 period.
908259_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	In February 2010 we implemented a Company-wide restructuring plan due to our decision to scale back activities in some of our ongoing clinical projects.
908259_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	The reduction in other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same twelve month period of 2009 is primarily due to a reduction in both our research and development facility related costs as well as program wide support costs for the comparable 2010 period.
908259_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	General and administrative expenses The table below summarizes the most significant components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated, in thousands and as a percentage of total general and administrative expenses and provides the changes in these components and their percentages: The reduction in employee compensation and related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same twelve month period of 2009 is due to a reduction in both our average full time equivalents of 16% and expenses in the 2009 period for administrative costs associated with the Symphony ViDA entity that did not recur in the 2010 period.
908259_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	In February 2010, we implemented a Company-wide restructuring plan due to our decision to scale back activities in some of our ongoing clinical projects.
908259_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	The number and scope of our clinical development projects affects how we staff and support those projects.
908259_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	The increase in stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same twelve month period of 2009 is due to timing and vesting periods of option awards to employees.
908259_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	The reduction in consulting and professional services expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same twelve month period of 2009 is primarily due to a reduction in both recurring professional services fees including director and audit fees for the comparable periods as well as one time costs incurred in the 2009 period for corporate wide quality systems reviews and costs incurred in our attempt to acquire VaxGen Inc.
908259_12_ITEM7_P87_S2	that did not recur in the 2010 period.
908259_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	On February 11, 2010, we announced a restructuring plan designed to focus resources on our highest-value clinical assets and reduce our cash utilization.
908259_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	Key aspects of the restructuring were as follows:
908259_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	We continued to advance our high-priority Phase 2 ZYBRESTAT trial in non-small cell lung cancer (FALCON study), with a focus on the presentation of updated safety and efficacy results anticipated for presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in June 2011.
908259_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	We stopped further enrollment in the Phase 2/3 FACT clinical trial in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), but continued to treat and follow all patients who enrolled in the study.
908259_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	We discontinued enrolling patients in our OXi4503 Phase 1b trial in patients with hepatic tumors.
908259_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	We discontinued enrollment in our Phase 2 FAVOR study of ZYBRESTAT in polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), a form of macular degeneration.
908259_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	In addition, we reduced our workforce by 20 employees or approximately 49%.
908259_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	Other Income and Expenses The table below summarizes Other Income and Expense in our Income Statement for the years 2010 and 2009, in thousands.
908259_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	We record non-cash gain/(loss) as a result of a change in the estimated Fair Market Value ( FMV ) of our Derivative Liabilities and the common stock warrants issued in connection with our equity offerings as discussed in Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to and Potentially Settled in the Company s Common stock, Note 1 to our financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
908259_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	In 2010, the loss primarily relates to the triggering of the full-ratchet provisions of the PIPE warrants, where the exercise price of each warrant was decreased, causing a greater warrant liability.
908259_12_ITEM7_P95_S2	In 2009, the gain primarily relates to the decline in the underlying fair value of the common stock.
908259_12_ITEM7_P95_S3	The decrease in Investment income of $93,000 for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily a result of a reduction in our average month end cash balance available for investment during the respective periods.
908259_12_ITEM7_P95_S4	The Other income (expense) amounts are derived from our gain and loss on foreign currency exchange and reflect both a change in number of foreign clinical trials and the fluctuation in exchange rates.
908259_12_ITEM7_P95_S5	Also included in the fiscal 2010 amount is our receipt of $733,000 in connection with qualified investments in a qualifying therapeutic discovery project under section 48D of the Internal Revenue Code in November 2010.
908259_12_ITEM7_P95_S6	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES To date, we have financed our operations principally through net proceeds received from private and public equity financings and through our strategic development arrangement with Symphony, which concluded in 2009.
908259_12_ITEM7_P95_S7	We have experienced negative cash flow from operations each year since our inception, except in fiscal 2000.
908259_12_ITEM7_P95_S8	As of December 31, 2011, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $217,353,000.
908259_12_ITEM7_P95_S9	We expect to continue to incur increased expenses, resulting in losses, over at least the next several years due to, among other factors, our continuing and planned clinical trials and anticipated research and development activities.
908259_12_ITEM7_P95_S10	We had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately $9,992,000 at December 31, 2011.
908259_12_ITEM7_P95_S11	The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated, in thousands:
908259_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	Non-cash adjustments to net loss in the year ended December 31, 2011 consist primarily of a gain from a change in the fair value of warrants and other financial instruments of $2,222,000, offset by stock-based compensation expense of $851,000 primarily related to the issuance of options to purchase our common stock.
908259_12_ITEM7_P96_S1	The net change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other payables of $956,000, offset in part by a decrease in restricted cash of $55,000.
908259_12_ITEM7_P96_S2	Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily attributable to the net proceeds of the sale of common stock under our at the market equity financing facility discussed below.
908259_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	On January 18, 2011, we entered into separate Warrant Exchange Agreements with each of the holders of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock issued in March 2010, pursuant to which, at the initial closing, the warrant holders exchanged their outstanding Series A and Series C warrants having ratchet price-based anti-dilution protections for (A) an aggregate of 1,096,933 shares of common stock and (B) Series E Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,222,623 shares of common stock.
908259_12_ITEM7_P97_S1	The Series E Warrants were not exercisable for six months, had an exercise price of $4.60 per share (reflecting the market value of the shares of common stock as of the close of trading on January 18, 2011, prior to the entry into the Warrant Exchange Agreements), and do not contain any price-based anti-dilution protections.
908259_12_ITEM7_P97_S2	In addition, we agreed to seek shareholder approval to issue up to 457,544 additional shares of common stock to the warrant holders in a subsequent closing.
908259_12_ITEM7_P97_S3	Such shareholder approval was obtained on March 18, 2011, and the Series E Warrants issued at the initial closing were exchanged for the additional 457,544 shares of common stock.
908259_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	On July 21, 2010, we entered into an at the market (ATM) equity offering sales agreement with McNicoll, Lewis Vlak LLC, (MLV), pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through MLV acting as our sales agent and underwriter.
908259_12_ITEM7_P98_S1	Sales of our common stock through MLV, are made on the principal trading market of our common stock by means of ordinary brokers transactions at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by MLV and us.
908259_12_ITEM7_P98_S2	MLV uses its commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock from time to time, based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits we may impose).
908259_12_ITEM7_P98_S3	We pay MLV a commission rate of up to 7.0% of the gross sales price per share of any common stock sold through MLV as agent under the sales agreement.
908259_12_ITEM7_P98_S4	During our fiscal year 2011, we sold approximately 7,794,000 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $17,146,000.
908259_12_ITEM7_P98_S5	Currently, we are not able to sell additional shares under this ATM due to SEC limitations on the number of shares issuable pursuant to a Form S-3 registration statement in a primary offering by smaller reporting companies such as us.
908259_12_ITEM7_P98_S6	We expect to be able to resume such sales in the second half of 2012, should we meet the issuance criteria of the SEC and NASDAQ.
908259_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	On September 1, 2011, we announced a restructuring plan, which included employee terminations, designed to focus our capital resources on our most promising early-stage clinical programs and further reduce our cash utilization.
908259_12_ITEM7_P99_S1	We offered severance benefits to the terminated employees, and have recorded a total charge of approximately $1,226,000, primarily associated with personnel-related termination costs.
908259_12_ITEM7_P99_S2	In order to provide for an orderly transition, we implemented the reduction in work force in a phased manner.
908259_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	Substantially all of the charge represents cash expenditures.
908259_12_ITEM7_P100_S1	Upon completion of the restructuring activities outlined above, we expect to reduce expenses from fiscal 2011 levels by an annual amount of approximately $2,000,000.
908259_12_ITEM7_P100_S2	Our ability to achieve this anticipated cost reduction is contingent upon only continuing to conduct the projects for which we are currently committed.
908259_12_ITEM7_P100_S3	Based on this planned level of cash utilization, we will be unable to advance our more developed candidates, including ZYBRESTAT in ATC.
908259_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	In November 2011, we entered into a purchase agreement for the sale, from time to time, of up to $20,000,000 of our common stock with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (LPC), a Chicago-based institutional investor.
908259_12_ITEM7_P101_S1	The proceeds from any sales under this purchase agreement will be used to further develop our late and early-stage clinical pipeline and to fund our ongoing operations.
908259_12_ITEM7_P101_S2	During the 36-month term of the purchase agreement, we control the timing and amount of any sales to LPC, if and when we decide, in accordance with the purchase agreement.
908259_12_ITEM7_P101_S3	LPC has no right to require us to sell any shares to LPC, but LPC is obligated to make purchases as we direct, subject to certain conditions, which include the continuing effectiveness of a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering the resale of the shares that may be issued to LPC and limitations related to the market value of our common stock.
908259_12_ITEM7_P101_S4	There is no guarantee that funding from LPC will be available when needed, or at all. .
908259_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	to purchase the Company s common stock and the purchase price of the shares related to any future sales will be based on the prevailing market prices of the Company s shares immediately preceding the notice of sale to LPC without any fixed discount.
908259_12_ITEM7_P102_S1	The agreement may be terminated by us at any time, at our sole discretion, without any cost or penalty.
908259_12_ITEM7_P102_S2	No amounts were received under this facility during 2011.
908259_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	In December 2011, we established a partnership agreement with Azanta Danmark A/S, or Azanta, to provide access to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of patients in a specified territory with ATC on a compassionate use basis.
908259_12_ITEM7_P103_S1	Our newly-formed Named Patient Program to be managed by Azanta provides a regulatory mechanism to allow healthcare professionals in the territory to prescribe ZYBRESTAT to individual ATC patients while it is still in development.
908259_12_ITEM7_P103_S2	Under the terms of the agreement, we will provide ZYBRESTAT to Azanta.
908259_12_ITEM7_P103_S3	Azanta will serve as exclusive distributor for ZYBRESTAT in the specified territory for this purpose and will provide ZYBRESTAT to physicians solely to treat ATC on a compassionate use basis in the territory covered by the agreement until such time as ZYBRESTAT may obtain marketing approval in that territory.
908259_12_ITEM7_P103_S4	The territory includes the European Union, including the Nordic countries and Switzerland, and Canada, and the agreement may also be expanded to include other countries on a country-by-country basis.
908259_12_ITEM7_P103_S5	OXiGENE and Azanta will cooperate on regulatory activities relating to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of ATC within the territory.
908259_12_ITEM7_P103_S6	There will be no transfer of ownership of intellectual property rights for ZYBRESTAT to Azanta under the terms of the agreement.
908259_12_ITEM7_P103_S7	We do not expect to receive significant income from Azanta under this arrangement.
908259_12_ITEM7_P103_S8	No revenue was recognized nor was any cash received under this agreement during 2011.
908259_12_ITEM7_P103_S9	Based on our limited ongoing programs and operations and taking into consideration the expected reductions in cash utilization resulting from our September 2011 reduction in force, we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents to support our operations through the first quarter of 2013.
908259_12_ITEM7_P103_S10	However, this level of cash utilization does not provide for the initiation of any significant projects to further the development of our most advanced product candidates, primarily ZYBRESTAT in ATC.
908259_12_ITEM7_P103_S11	Any significant further development of ZYBRESTAT or other capital intensive activities will be contingent upon our ability to raise additional capital in addition to our existing financing arrangements We will require significant additional funding to fund operations and to continue the development of our product candidates.
908259_12_ITEM7_P103_S12	Our ongoing capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including: the progress and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates under development, including ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503; the costs of complying with FDA and other regulatory agency requirements, including addressing the findings set forth by the FDA in its correspondence to us in March 2012, which will be significant as described in the Risk Factors above regarding the conduct of clinical trials and regulatory requirements; the progress of our research and development programs; the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals; the resources, if any, that we devote to develop manufacturing methods and advanced technologies; our ability to enter into licensing arrangements, including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs; the costs and expenses of filing, prosecuting and, if necessary, enforcing our patent claims, or defending against possible claims of infringement by third-party patent or other technology rights; the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, if any, undertaken by us; and, if and when approved, the demand for our products, which demand depends in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known, understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval, including the range of indications for which any product is granted approval.
908259_12_ITEM7_P103_S13	If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we will not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we will be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs or cease operations.
908259_12_ITEM7_P103_S14	We may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements.
908259_12_ITEM7_P103_S15	Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	If we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish, on terms that are not favorable to us, rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize.
908259_12_ITEM7_P104_S1	Our failure to raise capital when needed will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	The following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011 in thousands:
908259_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	Payments under clinical development and related commitments are based on the completion of activities as specified in the contract.
908259_12_ITEM7_P106_S1	The amounts in the table above assume the successful completion, by the third-party contractor, of all of the activities contemplated in the agreements.
908259_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	Our primary drug development programs are based on a series of natural products called Combretastatins.
908259_12_ITEM7_P107_S1	In August 1999, we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by Arizona State University.
908259_12_ITEM7_P107_S2	This agreement was subsequently amended in June 2002.
908259_12_ITEM7_P107_S3	From the inception of the agreement through December 31, 2011, we have paid a total of $2,500,000 in connection with this license.
908259_12_ITEM7_P107_S4	The agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals, which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones, as defined in the agreement.
908259_12_ITEM7_P107_S5	The license agreement also provides for additional payments upon our election to develop certain additional compounds, as defined in the agreement.
908259_12_ITEM7_P107_S6	Future milestone payments under this agreement could total $200,000.
908259_12_ITEM7_P107_S7	We are also required to pay royalties on future net sales of products associated with these patent rights.
908259_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK At December 31, 2011, we did not hold any derivative financial instruments, commodity-based instruments or other long-term debt obligations.
908259_12_ITEM7_P108_S1	We have accounted for certain outstanding warrants issued in connection with our prior equity offerings as liabilities as of December 31, 2011.
908259_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	We have adopted an Investment Policy, the primary objectives of which are to preserve principal, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields while preserving principal.
908259_12_ITEM7_P109_S1	Although our investments are subject to credit risk, we follow procedures to limit the amount of credit exposure in any single issue, issuer or type of investment.
908259_12_ITEM7_P109_S2	Our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase.
908259_12_ITEM7_P109_S3	However, due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration, we believe that interest rate risk is mitigated.
908259_12_ITEM7_P109_S4	Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in U.S. dollar accounts.
908259_12_ITEM7_P109_S5	Although we may from time to time conduct trials and studies outside of the United States, we believe our exposure to foreign currency risk to be limited as the arrangements are typically in jurisdictions with relatively stable currencies.
908259_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and report on the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
908259_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of December 31, 2011, to ensure that we record, process, summarize and report the information we must disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
908259_12_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, identified in connection with the evaluation of such control that occurred during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
908259_12_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
908259_12_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
908259_12_ITEM9A_P0_S5	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011.
908259_12_ITEM9A_P0_S6	This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
908259_12_ITEM9A_P0_S7	Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this Annual Report.
908259_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud.
908259_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time.
908259_12_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.
908259_12_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Because as of June 30, 2011 the Company s public float value was below $75,000,000, Ernst Young LLP was not required to issue an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting and, therefore, did not perform for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 an audit of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.

908259_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	Form 10-K Item 15(a)(1) OXiGENE, Inc.
908259_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	The following consolidated financial statements of OXiGENE, Inc. are included in Item 8:
908259_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of OXiGENE, Inc.
908259_12_ITEM15_P60_S1	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of OXiGENE, Inc. as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011.
908259_12_ITEM15_P60_S2	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
908259_12_ITEM15_P60_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
908259_12_ITEM15_P60_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
908259_12_ITEM15_P60_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
908259_12_ITEM15_P60_S6	We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
908259_12_ITEM15_P60_S7	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
908259_12_ITEM15_P60_S8	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
908259_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
908259_12_ITEM15_P61_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
908259_12_ITEM15_P61_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
908259_12_ITEM15_P61_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of OXiGENE, Inc. at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
908259_12_ITEM15_P61_S4	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that OXiGENE, Inc. will continue as a going concern.
908259_12_ITEM15_P61_S5	As more fully described in Note 1, the Company has incurred recurring operating losses and has significantly reduced the development of its most advanced product candidates.
908259_12_ITEM15_P61_S6	In order to significantly further develop its product pipeline, the Company will be required to raise additional capital, alternative means of financial support, or both.
908259_12_ITEM15_P61_S7	The ability of the Company to raise additional capital or alternative sources of financing is uncertain.
908259_12_ITEM15_P61_S8	These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
908259_12_ITEM15_P61_S9	Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1.
908259_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	The 2011 consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

908259_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	OXiGENE, INC. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011 1.
908259_12_ITEM15_P66_S1	Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business OXiGENE, Inc. (the Company ), incorporated in 1988 in the state of New York and reincorporated in 1992 in the state of Delaware, is a clinical-stage, biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics to treat cancer and eye diseases.
908259_12_ITEM15_P66_S2	OXiGENE s primary focus is the development of product candidates referred to as vascular disrupting agents, or VDAs, that selectively disable and destroy abnormal blood vessels that provide solid tumors a means of growth and survival and also are associated with visual impairment in a number of ophthalmological diseases and conditions.
908259_12_ITEM15_P66_S3	The Company intends to primarily target the development of its product candidates for the treatment of rare cancers that will be eligible for orphan drug status from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA.
908259_12_ITEM15_P66_S4	OXiGENE s lead candidate, ZYBRESTAT, has been awarded orphan drug status by the FDA and the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer, or ATC, and for the treatment of medullary, Stage IV papillary and Stage IV follicular thyroid cancers.
908259_12_ITEM15_P66_S5	The FDA has also granted Fast Track status to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of regionally advanced and/or metastatic ATC, as well as in ovarian cancer.
908259_12_ITEM15_P66_S6	By focusing on developing ZYBRESTAT in ATC, and potentially pursuing other rare or orphan indications, the Company believes it will be able to take advantage of significant benefits associated with orphan drug status, such as:
908259_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	Seven years of marketing exclusivity after the approval of the drug.
908259_12_ITEM15_P68_S0	The Orphan Drug Act was passed in January 1983 to stimulate the research, development, and approval of products that treat rare diseases.
908259_12_ITEM15_P69_S0	An orphan drug is defined as a product that treats a rare disease affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States.
908259_12_ITEM15_P69_S1	Drugs are granted orphan status for a specific indication.
908259_12_ITEM15_P70_S0	To date, more than 400 subjects have been treated with ZYBRESTAT in human clinical trials, and the drug candidate has generally been observed to be well-tolerated.
908259_12_ITEM15_P71_S0	In February 2011, the Company s board of directors voted unanimously to implement a 1:20 reverse stock split of the Company s common stock, following authorization of the reverse split by a shareholder vote on December 21, 2010.
908259_12_ITEM15_P71_S1	The reverse split became effective on February 22, 2011.
908259_12_ITEM15_P71_S2	All of the share and per share amounts, except for the per share fair value amounts, discussed and shown in the consolidated financial statements and notes have been adjusted to reflect the effect of this reverse split.
908259_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	On July 21, 2010, the Company entered into an at the market (ATM) equity offering sales agreement with McNicoll, Lewis Vlak LLC, (MLV), pursuant to which it may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through MLV acting as its sales agent and underwriter.
908259_12_ITEM15_P72_S1	Sales of OXiGENE common stock through MLV, are made on the principal trading market of the Company s common stock by means of ordinary brokers transactions at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by MLV and OXiGENE.
908259_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	MLV uses its commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock from time to time, based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits we may impose).
908259_12_ITEM15_P73_S1	OXiGENE pays MLV a commission rate of up to 7.0% of the gross sales price per share of any common stock sold through MLV as agent under the sales agreement.
908259_12_ITEM15_P74_S0	OXiGENE, INC. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) net proceeds of approximately $17,146,000.
908259_12_ITEM15_P74_S1	Currently, OXiGENE is not able to sell additional shares under this ATM due to SEC limitations on the number of shares issuable pursuant to a Form S-3 registration statement in a primary offering by smaller reporting companies such as the Company.
908259_12_ITEM15_P74_S2	OXiGENE expects to be able to resume such sales in the second half of 2012, should it meet the issuance criteria of the SEC and NASDAQ.
908259_12_ITEM15_P75_S0	On September 1, 2011, OXiGENE announced a restructuring plan, which included employee terminations, designed to focus its capital resources on the Company s most promising early-stage clinical programs and further reduce its cash utilization.
908259_12_ITEM15_P75_S1	OXiGENE offered severance benefits to the terminated employees, and has recorded a total charge of approximately $1,226,000, primarily associated with personnel-related termination costs.
908259_12_ITEM15_P76_S0	In order to provide for an orderly transition, the Company implemented the reduction in work force in a phased manner.
908259_12_ITEM15_P77_S0	Substantially all of the charge represents cash expenditures.
908259_12_ITEM15_P77_S1	Upon completion of the restructuring activities outlined above, OXiGENE expects to reduce expenses from fiscal 2011 levels by an annual amount of approximately $2,000,000.
908259_12_ITEM15_P77_S2	The Company s ability to achieve this anticipated cost reduction is contingent upon OXiGENE continuing to conduct only the projects to which the Company is currently committed.
908259_12_ITEM15_P77_S3	This planned level of cash utilization, does not provide for the initiation of any significant projects to further the development of the Company s most advanced product candidates, primarily ZYBRESTAT in ATC.
908259_12_ITEM15_P77_S4	OXiGENE will require significant additional capital resources in order for significant further development to continue.
908259_12_ITEM15_P78_S0	In November 2011, OXiGENE entered into a purchase agreement for the sale, from time to time, of up to $20,000,000 of its common stock with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (LPC), a Chicago-based institutional investor.
908259_12_ITEM15_P78_S1	The proceeds from any sales under this purchase agreement will be used to further develop the Company s late and early-stage clinical pipeline and to fund the Company s ongoing operations.
908259_12_ITEM15_P78_S2	During the 36-month term of the purchase agreement, the Company controls the timing and amount of any sales to LPC, if and when it decides, in accordance with the purchase agreement.
908259_12_ITEM15_P78_S3	LPC has no right to require the Company to sell any shares to LPC, but LPC is obligated to make purchases as OXiGENE directs, subject to certain conditions, which include the continuing effectiveness of a registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission covering the resale of the shares that may be issued to LPC and limitations related to the market value of the Company s common stock.
908259_12_ITEM15_P78_S4	There is no guarantee that funding from LPC will be available when needed, or at all, or that the Company will be able to maintain effectiveness of the aforementioned registration statement.
908259_12_ITEM15_P78_S5	There are no upper limits to the price LPC may pay to purchase the Company s common stock and the purchase price of the shares related to any future sales will be based on the prevailing market prices of the Company s shares immediately preceding the notice of sale to LPC without any fixed discount.
908259_12_ITEM15_P78_S6	The agreement may be terminated by OXiGENE at any time, at its sole discretion, without any cost or penalty.
908259_12_ITEM15_P78_S7	No amounts were received under this facility during 2011.
908259_12_ITEM15_P79_S0	In December 2011, OXiGENE established a partnership agreement with Azanta Danmark A/S, or Azanta, to provide access to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of patients in a specified territory with ATC on a compassionate use basis.
908259_12_ITEM15_P79_S1	The Company s newly-formed Named Patient Program to be managed by Azanta, provides a regulatory mechanism to allow healthcare professionals in the territory to prescribe ZYBRESTAT to individual ATC patients while it is still in development.
908259_12_ITEM15_P79_S2	Under the terms of the agreement, OXiGENE will provide ZYBRESTAT to Azanta.
908259_12_ITEM15_P79_S3	Azanta will serve as exclusive distributor for ZYBRESTAT in the specified territory for this purpose and will provide ZYBRESTAT to physicians solely to treat ATC on a compassionate use basis in the territory covered by the agreement until such time as ZYBRESTAT may obtain marketing approval in that territory.
908259_12_ITEM15_P79_S4	The territory includes the European Union, including the Nordic countries and Switzerland, and Canada, and the agreement may also be expanded to include other countries on a country-by-country basis.
908259_12_ITEM15_P79_S5	OXiGENE and Azanta will cooperate on regulatory activities relating to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of ATC within the territory.
908259_12_ITEM15_P79_S6	There will be no transfer of ownership of intellectual property rights for ZYBRESTAT to Azanta under the terms of the agreement.
908259_12_ITEM15_P79_S7	We do not expect to receive significant income from Azanta under this arrangement.
908259_12_ITEM15_P79_S8	No revenue was recognized nor was any cash received under this agreement during 2011.
908259_12_ITEM15_P80_S0	In addition to the LPC purchase agreement referenced above, the Company is aggressively pursuing other forms of capital infusion including public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements with organizations that have capabilities and/or products that are complementary to our the Company s capabilities and/or products, in order to continue the development of our product candidates.
908259_12_ITEM15_P80_S1	However, there can be no assurances that the Company will complete any strategic alliances or collaborative development agreements, and the terms of such arrangements may not be advantageous to the Company.
908259_12_ITEM15_P81_S0	We have experienced net losses every year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2011, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $217,353,000.
908259_12_ITEM15_P81_S1	We expect to incur significant additional operating losses over at least the next several years, principally as a result of our continuing clinical trials and anticipated research and development expenditures.
908259_12_ITEM15_P81_S2	The principal source of our working capital to date has been the proceeds of private and public equity financings and to a lesser extent the exercise of warrants and stock options.
908259_12_ITEM15_P81_S3	We currently have no recurring material amount of licensing or other income.
908259_12_ITEM15_P81_S4	As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $9,992,000 in cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents.
908259_12_ITEM15_P81_S5	Based on the Company s limited ongoing programs and operations and taking into consideration the expected reductions in cash utilization resulting from the Company s September 2011 reduction in force, the Company expects its existing cash and cash equivalents to support its operations through the first quarter of 2013.
908259_12_ITEM15_P81_S6	However, this level of cash utilization does not provide for the initiation of any significant projects to further the development of the Company s most advanced product candidates, primarily ZYBRESTAT in ATC.
908259_12_ITEM15_P81_S7	Any significant further development of ZYBRESTAT or other capital intensive activities will be contingent upon the Company s ability to raise additional capital in addition to the existing financing arrangements.
908259_12_ITEM15_P81_S8	OXiGENE s ongoing capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including: the progress and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials of its product candidates under development, including ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503; the costs of complying with FDA and other regulatory agency requirements, including addressing the findings set forth by the FDA in its correspondence to the Company in March 2012, which will be significant as described in the Risk Factors above regarding the conduct of clinical trials and regulatory requirements; the progress of its research and development programs; the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals; the resources, if any, that the Company devotes to develop manufacturing methods and advanced technologies; OXiGENE s ability to enter into licensing arrangements, including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable it to continue the Company s development and clinical trial programs; the costs and expenses of filing, prosecuting and, if necessary, enforcing OXiGENE s patent claims, or defending against possible claims of infringement by third-party patent or other technology rights; the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, if any, undertaken by the Company; and, if and when approved, the demand for OXiGENE s products, which demand depends in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known, understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval, including the range of indications for which any product is granted approval.
908259_12_ITEM15_P81_S9	Additional funding may not be available to OXiGENE on acceptable terms, or at all.
908259_12_ITEM15_P81_S10	If the Company is unable to access additional funds when needed, it may not be able to continue the development of its product candidates or the Company could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of its development programs and other operations.
908259_12_ITEM15_P81_S11	Any additional equity financing, if available to the Company, may not be available on favorable terms, most likely will be dilutive to its current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_12_ITEM15_P81_S12	If the Company accesses funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, it may be required to relinquish rights to some of its technologies or product candidates that it would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on its own, on terms that are not favorable to the Company.
908259_12_ITEM15_P81_S13	The Company s ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, will materially harm its business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_12_ITEM15_P82_S0	OXiGENE, INC. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) and trade in the over-the-counter market.
908259_12_ITEM15_P82_S1	These uncertainties create substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
908259_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	The Report of Independent Registered Accounting Firm at the beginning of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of this Form 10-K includes a going concern explanatory paragraph.
908259_12_ITEM15_P83_S1	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
908259_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
908259_12_ITEM15_P84_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
908259_12_ITEM15_P85_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk The Company has no significant off balance sheet concentrations of credit risk.
908259_12_ITEM15_P85_S1	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents.
908259_12_ITEM15_P85_S2	The Company holds its cash and cash equivalents at one financial institution.
908259_12_ITEM15_P85_S3	The Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
908259_12_ITEM15_P85_S4	The Company has $20,000 and $75,000 of restricted cash as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively that is used to secure financing through a Company credit card.
908259_12_ITEM15_P85_S5	This amount is separated from cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
908259_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Company is required to disclose information on all assets and liabilities reported at fair value that enables an assessment of the inputs used in determining the reported fair values.
908259_12_ITEM15_P87_S0	Fair value hierarchy is now established that prioritizes valuation inputs based on the observable nature of those inputs.
908259_12_ITEM15_P87_S1	The fair value hierarchy applies only to the valuation inputs used in determining the reported fair value of our investments and is not a measure of the investment credit quality.
908259_12_ITEM15_P87_S2	The hierarchy defines three levels of valuation inputs:
908259_12_ITEM15_P88_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, OXiGENE did not hold any assets or liabilities subject to these standards, except the derivative liabilities and other financial instruments discussed below in Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to and Potentially Settled in the Company s Common stock which are level 3 inputs.
908259_12_ITEM15_P89_S0	Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the fair value standards as they relate to non-recurring fair value measurements, such as the assessment of goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment.
908259_12_ITEM15_P90_S0	Furniture and Fixtures, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements Furniture and fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost.
908259_12_ITEM15_P91_S0	The present value of the amount paid under the license agreement with Arizona State University (see Note 3) has been capitalized and is being amortized over the term of the agreement (approximately 15.5 years).
908259_12_ITEM15_P91_S1	The Company is required to perform an impairment analysis of its long-lived assets if triggering events occur.
908259_12_ITEM15_P91_S2	The Company reviews for such triggering events, such as a going concern opinion and continuing losses, periodically.
908259_12_ITEM15_P91_S3	The license agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals, which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones as defined in the agreement.
908259_12_ITEM15_P91_S4	The Company expenses these payments to research and development in the period the obligation becomes both probable and estimable.
908259_12_ITEM15_P92_S0	Accrued Research and Development The Company charges all research and development expenses, both internal and external costs, to operations as incurred.
908259_12_ITEM15_P92_S1	The Company s research and development costs represent expenses incurred from the engagement of outside professional service organizations, product manufacturers and consultants associated with the development of the Company s potential product candidates.
908259_12_ITEM15_P92_S2	The Company recognizes expenses associated with these arrangements based on the completion of activities as specified in the applicable contracts.
908259_12_ITEM15_P92_S3	Costs incurred under fixed-fee contracts are expensed ratably over the contract period absent any knowledge that the services will be performed other than ratably.
908259_12_ITEM15_P92_S4	Costs incurred under contracts with clinical trial sites and principal investigators are generally accrued on a patient-treated basis consistent with the terms outlined in the contract.
908259_12_ITEM15_P92_S5	In determining costs incurred on some of these programs, the Company takes into consideration a number of factors, including estimates and input provided by internal program managers.
908259_12_ITEM15_P92_S6	Upon termination of such contracts, the Company is normally only liable for costs incurred and committed to date.
908259_12_ITEM15_P92_S7	As a result, accrued research and development expenses represent the Company s reasonably estimated contractual liability to outside service providers at any particular point in time.
908259_12_ITEM15_P93_S0	Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to and Potentially Settled in the Company s Common stock The Company evaluates all derivative financial instruments issued in connection with its equity offerings when determining the proper accounting treatment for such instruments in the Company s financial statements.
908259_12_ITEM15_P93_S1	The Company considers a number of generally accepted accounting principles to determine such treatment.
908259_12_ITEM15_P93_S2	The Company performs a number of steps to evaluate the features of the instrument against the guidance provided in the accounting pronouncements in order to determine the appropriate accounting treatment.
908259_12_ITEM15_P94_S0	The Company s policy with regard to settling outstanding financial instruments is to settle those with the earliest maturity date first which essentially sets the order of preference for settling the awards.
908259_12_ITEM15_P95_S0	In the majority of circumstances, the Company utilizes the Black Scholes method to determine the fair value of its derivative financial instruments.
908259_12_ITEM15_P95_S1	In some cases, where appropriate, the Company utilizes the Binomial method to determine the fair value of such derivative financial instruments.
908259_12_ITEM15_P95_S2	Key valuation factors in determining the fair value include the current stock price as of the date of measurement, the exercise price, the remaining contractual life, expected volatility for the instrument and the risk-free interest rate.
908259_12_ITEM15_P96_S0	Changes in fair value are recorded as a gain or loss in the Company s Statement of Operations with the corresponding amount recorded as an adjustment to liability on its Balance Sheet.
908259_12_ITEM15_P96_S1	The expected volatility factor, in particular, is subject to significant variability from measurement period to measurement period and can result in large gains or losses from period to period.
908259_12_ITEM15_P97_S0	In December 2011, OXiGENE established a distribution agreement to provide access to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of patients in a specified territory with ATC on a compassionate use basis.
908259_12_ITEM15_P98_S0	OXiGENE, INC. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) and sale to compassionate use patients, the distributor has 30 days to inspect the product for defects and to ensure that the product conforms to the warranties made by the Company.
908259_12_ITEM15_P98_S1	If the distributor does not notify OXiGENE of any defective product within the 30-day period it will be deemed to have accepted the product.
908259_12_ITEM15_P98_S2	Revenue is recognized based on product accepted at the conclusion of the 30-day inspection period.

908259_12_ITEM15_P136_S4	The Company established the fair value of the CEFF warrants using the Black-Scholes option valuation model as reflected in the table below:
908259_12_ITEM15_P137_S0	Direct Registration Warrants On July 20, 2009, OXiGENE raised approximately $10,000,000 in gross proceeds, before deducting placement agents fees and other offering expenses, in a registered direct offering (the Offering ) relating to the sale of 312,500 units, each unit consisting of (i) one share of common stock, (ii) a five-year warrant ( Direct Registration Series I ) to purchase 0.45 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $42.00 per share of common stock and (iii) a short-term warrant ( Direct Registration Series II ) to purchase 0.45 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $32.00 per share of common stock (the Units ).
908259_12_ITEM15_P137_S1	The short-term warrants expired on September 24, 2010 consistent with the terms of the warrant, without being exercised.
908259_12_ITEM15_P138_S0	OXiGENE determined that the Direct Registration Series I warrants should be classified as a liability as they require delivery of registered shares of common stock and thus could require net-cash settlement in certain circumstances.
908259_12_ITEM15_P138_S1	Accordingly, these warrants were recorded as a liability at their fair value as of the date of their issuance and are revalued at each subsequent reporting date.
908259_12_ITEM15_P139_S0	OXiGENE, INC. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 2,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock in the aggregate.
908259_12_ITEM15_P139_S1	This number includes shares of its common stock, if any, that were subject to awards under the Company s 1996 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1996 Plan ) as of the date of adoption of the 2005 Plan but which were returned or will be returned to the 2005 Plan upon the cancellation, surrender or termination of such award.
908259_12_ITEM15_P139_S2	Currently, the 2005 Plan allows for awards of up to 200,000 shares that may be granted to any one participant in any fiscal year.
908259_12_ITEM15_P139_S3	For options subject to graded vesting, the Company elected the straight-line method of expensing these awards over the service period.
908259_12_ITEM15_P139_S4	The following is a summary of the Company s stock option activity under its 1996 Plan and 2005 Plan for the year ended December 31, 2011:
908259_12_ITEM15_P140_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011, 29,900 options expired.
908259_12_ITEM15_P140_S1	As of December 31, 2011 there was approximately $475,800 of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards that is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of approximately 2 years.
908259_12_ITEM15_P141_S0	The following stock options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2009 and 2008:
908259_12_ITEM15_P142_S0	The fair values for the stock options granted were estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for the three years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:
908259_12_ITEM15_P143_S0	In calculating the estimated fair value of its stock options, the Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires the consideration of the following six variables for purposes of estimating fair value:
908259_12_ITEM15_P144_S0	the risk free interest rate for the expected option term.
908259_12_ITEM15_P144_S1	The closing market price of its common stock on the date of grant.
908259_12_ITEM15_P145_S0	The expected term of options represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on an analysis of historical behavior of participants over time.
908259_12_ITEM15_P145_S1	The expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Company s stock price is expected to fluctuate during the term of the option granted.
908259_12_ITEM15_P145_S2	OXiGENE determines the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of its common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term.
908259_12_ITEM15_P145_S3	Expected Dividends Because OXiGENE has never declared or paid any cash dividends on any of its common stock and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future, the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option.
908259_12_ITEM15_P146_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury issues with a remaining life consistent with the option s expected term on the date of grant.
908259_12_ITEM15_P146_S1	The Company is required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
908259_12_ITEM15_P146_S2	This requirement applies to all awards that are not yet vested, including awards granted prior to January 1, 2006.
908259_12_ITEM15_P146_S3	Accordingly, OXiGENE performed a historical analysis of option awards that were forfeited prior to vesting, and ultimately recorded total stock option expense that reflected this estimated forfeiture rate.
908259_12_ITEM15_P146_S4	In the Company s calculation, it segregated participants into two distinct groups, (1) directors and officers and (2) employees, and OXiGENE s estimated forfeiture rates were calculated at 25% and 50%, respectively using the straight line method.
908259_12_ITEM15_P146_S5	This analysis will be re-evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary.
908259_12_ITEM15_P147_S0	Non-Vested Restricted Stock As of December 31, 2010, the Company had 1,000 shares of non-vested restricted common stock outstanding related to grants of restricted common stock in June 2007.
908259_12_ITEM15_P147_S1	During fiscal 2011, 500 of those shares vested with the remaining 500 shares being forfeited, such that as of December 31, 2011, the Company did not have any non-vested restricted common stock outstanding.
908259_12_ITEM15_P147_S2	The Company recorded expense of approximately $20,000, $82,000 and $242,000 related to outstanding restricted stock awards during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
908259_12_ITEM15_P147_S3	The restricted stock awards were valued based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on their respective grant dates.
908259_12_ITEM15_P147_S4	Compensation expense was recognized on a straight -line basis over the 4 year vesting period of the awards.
908259_12_ITEM15_P148_S0	Under the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 2009 ESPP ), employees have the option to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at 85% of the closing price on the first day of each purchase period or the last day of each purchase period (as defined in the 2009 ESPP), whichever is lower, up to specified limits.

908259_12_ITEM15_P155_S1	In connection with such amendment, OXiGENE and Holdings also entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement.
908259_12_ITEM15_P156_S0	OXiGENE, INC. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) additional securities issued in connection with the July 2009 Registered Direct Offering.

908259_12_ITEM15_P157_S1	In addition, the approximately $12,400,000 in cash and marketable securities held by ViDA was transferred to OXiGENE.
908259_12_ITEM15_P157_S2	OXiGENE recorded the acquisition of ViDA as a capital transaction and the $10,383,000 excess of the fair market value of the common shares issued by OXiGENE ($15,600,000) over the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest ($5,217,000) was reflected directly in equity as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital.
908259_12_ITEM15_P157_S3	As a result, the noncontrolling interest balance was eliminated.
908259_12_ITEM15_P157_S4	The reduction to Additional paid-in capital was also presented as an increase in the loss applicable to common stock within the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
908259_12_ITEM15_P158_S0	OXiGENE consolidated the financial position and results of operations of Symphony ViDA, Inc. from October 2008, when it entered into a strategic collaboration with Symphony ViDA Holdings, LLC, until July 20, 2009 when OXiGENE acquired 100% of ViDA pursuant to the Amended Purchase Option Agreement.
908259_12_ITEM15_P158_S1	The funding supported pre-clinical and clinical development by OXiGENE, on behalf of ViDA, for ZYBRESTAT for ophthalmology and OXi4503.
908259_12_ITEM15_P159_S0	Basic and diluted net loss per share was calculated by dividing the net loss per share attributed to OXIGENE common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
908259_12_ITEM15_P159_S1	Diluted net loss per share includes the effect of all dilutive, potentially issuable common equivalent shares as defined using the treasury stock method.
908259_12_ITEM15_P159_S2	All of the Company s common stock equivalents are anti-dilutive due to the Company s net loss position for all periods presented.
908259_12_ITEM15_P159_S3	Accordingly, common stock equivalents of approximately 1,154,000, 3,354,000 and 391,000 at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares for diluted net loss per share.
908259_12_ITEM15_P159_S4	During 2009, the Company recorded the excess of the purchase price over the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest in ViDA as an increase in the loss applicable to common stock (See Symphony Transaction above).

908259_12_ITEM15_P164_S5	All unvested options held by Mr. Murphy were forfeited as of September 1, 2011.
908259_12_ITEM15_P164_S6	After consideration of the available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company has determined that a full valuation allowance at December 31, 2011 and 2010, is necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.
908259_12_ITEM15_P164_S7	The valuation allowance decreased by approximately $2,854,000 and increased by approximately $5,640,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, due primarily to changes in federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards.
908259_12_ITEM15_P164_S8	At December 31, 2011, the Company had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $197,097,000 for U.S. income tax purposes, which began to expire during 2011 and state operating loss carry-forwards of $48,502,000 in Massachusetts that begin expiring in 2012 and $31,392,000 in California that begin to expire in 2027.
908259_12_ITEM15_P164_S9	The Company also had tax credits of $3,080,000 related to federal and state research and development activities which begin to expire in 2021.
908259_12_ITEM15_P164_S10	The Company recorded a capital loss carryover of approximately $4,000,000 in 2009 that generated a deferred tax asset of $1,490,000.
908259_12_ITEM15_P165_S0	The future utilization of the net operating loss carry-forwards and credit carry-forwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership changes that could have occurred in the past or that may occur in the future under the provisions of IRC Section 382 or 383 of the internal revenue code.
908259_12_ITEM15_P166_S0	The Company has not, as yet, conducted a study of its research and development credit carry-forwards.
908259_12_ITEM15_P166_S1	This study may result in an adjustment to the Company s research and development credit carry-forwards, however, until a study is completed and any adjustment is known, no amounts are presented as an uncertain tax position.
908259_12_ITEM15_P166_S2	A full valuation allowance has been provided against the Company s research and development credits and if an adjustment is required, this adjustment would be offset by any adjustment to the deferred tax asset established for the research and development credit carry-forward and the valuation allowance.
908259_12_ITEM15_P167_S0	In 2010, the Company received $733,000 in tax credit grants under the U.S. Government s Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Project for qualified research and development expenses.
908259_12_ITEM15_P167_S1	These proceeds have been recognized as other income.
908259_12_ITEM15_P168_S0	The Company provides for income taxes under the liability method in accordance with the FASB s guidance on accounting for income taxes.
908259_12_ITEM15_P168_S1	As all of the Company s deferred tax assets have been reserved for in a valuation allowance, no provision for (benefit from) income taxes have been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
908259_12_ITEM15_P168_S2	A reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the Company s effective tax rate is as follows: The provisions of FIN 48 (as codified under ASC 740), were adopted by the Company on January 1, 2007.
908259_12_ITEM15_P169_S0	ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
908259_12_ITEM15_P169_S1	ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
908259_12_ITEM15_P170_S0	The implementation of ASC 740 did not have a material impact on the Company s financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
908259_12_ITEM15_P171_S0	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits.
908259_12_ITEM15_P171_S1	There are currently no federal or state audits in progress, tax years still subject to examination for Federal and the State of Massachusetts and California authorities include all prior years due to the existence of net operating loss carry-forwards.
908259_12_ITEM15_P171_S2	However, the statute of limitation for assessment by the internal revenue service and state authorities is only open for tax years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010.

908259_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	We are a clinical-stage, biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics primarily to treat cancer.
908259_13_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our primary focus is the development of product candidates referred to as vascular disrupting agents, or VDAs, that selectively disable and destroy abnormal blood vessels that provide solid tumors a means of growth and survival, and also are associated with visual impairment in a number of ophthalmological diseases and conditions.
908259_13_ITEM1_P0_S2	Our lead compound, ZYBRESTAT is a reversible tubulin binding agent that works by disrupting the network of abnormal blood vessels, or vasculature, within solid tumors, also referred to as vascular disruption.
908259_13_ITEM1_P0_S3	Vascular disruption leads to tumor hypoxia, which refers to the process of starving the tumor of vitally necessary oxygen supply and subsequent tumor cell death.
908259_13_ITEM1_P0_S4	More specifically, ZYBRESTAT selectively targets the existing abnormal and largely immature vasculature found in most solid tumors and causes endothelial cells that make up the walls of the blood vessels in that vasculature to lose their normally flat shape and to become round, thus blocking the flow of blood to the tumor.
908259_13_ITEM1_P0_S5	The downstream tumor environment is then deprived of oxygen and nutrients, and the resulting restriction in blood supply kills the cells in the central portion of the tumor.
908259_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	Based on ZYBRESTAT s antitumor activity observed in animal models, we have conducted multiple clinical trials of ZYBRESTAT in a variety of tumor types.
908259_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	Summary of Strategy We continue to develop ZYBRESTAT, which is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials.
908259_13_ITEM1_P1_S2	We have seen clinical activity in ovarian cancer, anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) and other indications, and observed tolerability to date in over 400 patients.
908259_13_ITEM1_P1_S3	We primarily focus on the development of product candidates for the treatment of rare cancers that will be eligible for orphan drug status and fast track status.
908259_13_ITEM1_P1_S4	We also believe that combining ZYBRESTAT with other therapies will provide us with multiple clinical strategies for the eventual commercialization of ZYBRESTAT.
908259_13_ITEM1_P1_S5	Based on this and subject to our receipt of sufficient funding, our strategy is as follows:
908259_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	To focus on ovarian cancer as one of our lead indications:
908259_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	We continue to support the ongoing randomized Phase 2 trial of ZYBRESTAT in combination with bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer.
908259_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	The trial, which is being conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group or GOG, an organization dedicated to clinical research in the field of gynecologic cancer, and is under the sponsorship of the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, or CTEP, of the National Cancer Institute, or NCI.
908259_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	We would also like to support two additional controlled clinical studies in advanced ovarian cancer, subject to our receipt of sufficient funding, as follows:
908259_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	A Phase 2 study of ZYBRESTAT in combination with weekly paclitaxel in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.
908259_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	A Phase 1b/2 study of ZYBRESTAT in combination with pazopanib, an antiangiogenic oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in recurrent ovarian cancer.
908259_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	To pursue the commercialization of ZYBRESTAT in Europe for the treatment of ATC with a marketing authorization under exceptional or conditional circumstances, as further discussed below.
908259_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	To continue to support the ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 1 trial of OXi4503 in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, or AML, or myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, being conducted at the University of Florida and with support by The Leukemia Lymphoma Society s Therapy Acceleration Program.
908259_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	To pursue the development of ZYBRESTAT to treat refractory carcinoid syndrome associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors involving the liver.
908259_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	We currently have orphan drug status in the United States and in the European Union for ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of ATC, medullary thyroid cancer, Stage IV papillary thyroid cancer, and Stage IV follicular thyroid cancer, and for ZYBRETSTAT in the United States for the treatment of ovarian cancer.
908259_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	We have applied for orphan drug status in the European Union for ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of ovarian cancer.
908259_13_ITEM1_P9_S3	We also have orphan drug status in the United States for our product candidate OXi4503 for the treatment of AML.
908259_13_ITEM1_P9_S4	The FDA has also granted Fast Track status to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of ATC, and a special protocol assessment, or SPA, was granted for a Phase 3 trial in ATC.
908259_13_ITEM1_P9_S5	By focusing on developing ZYBRESTAT in rare or orphan indications, in addition to addressing significant unmet medical needs, we believe we will be able to take advantage of significant benefits associated with orphan drug status, such as:
908259_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	Seven years of marketing exclusivity after the approval of the drug in the US and 10 years of exclusivity in the EU.
908259_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	The Orphan Drug Act was passed in the US in January 1983 to stimulate the research, development, and approval of products that treat rare diseases.
908259_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	An orphan drug is defined as a product that treats a rare disease affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States.
908259_13_ITEM1_P11_S2	Drugs are granted orphan status for a specific indication.
908259_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	In the EU, orphan designation is granted for a life-threatening or debilitating disease that affects 5 in 10,000 or fewer subjects in the EU.
908259_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	ZYBRESTAT for Oncology ZYBRESTAT in Ovarian Cancer We believe that ovarian cancer represents an unmet medical need and a significant commercial opportunity.
908259_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death among women in the United States.
908259_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	Ovarian cancer is most often diagnosed at an advanced stage, after the cancer has spread beyond the ovary due in part to a lack of early symptoms and of effective ovarian cancer screening tests.
908259_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	Based on an annual incidence rate of 12.7 per 100,000 women, according to the National Cancer Institute, it is estimated that 22,280 women will be diagnosed with, and 15,500 women will die of, ovarian cancer in the United States in 2012.
908259_13_ITEM1_P15_S2	Assuming slightly higher observed incidence rates, this would translate into an estimated 44,728 new cases of ovarian cancer annually in Europe and 8,328 new cases in Japan.
908259_13_ITEM1_P15_S3	We believe that combining ZYBRESTAT with other therapies will provide us with multiple clinical strategies for the potential commercialization of ZYBRESTAT in advanced ovarian cancer.
908259_13_ITEM1_P15_S4	One strategy is to use ZYBRESTAT without cytotoxic chemotherapy, which is the basis for our Phase 2 clinical trial in advanced ovarian cancer in combination with bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody angiogenesis inhibitor targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF, and a planned trial, subject to funding, with ZYBRESTAT in combination with pazopanib, a multi-kinase inhibitor targeting VEGF.
908259_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	ZYBRESTAT with platinum based chemotherapy which is the basis for our planned trial, subject to funding, with paclitaxel.
908259_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	ZYBRESTAT is currently being studied in a Phase 2 clinical trial in advanced ovarian cancer in combination with bevacizumab.
908259_13_ITEM1_P16_S2	We believe that combining vascular targeting agents without cytotoxic chemotherapy may be a clinically active yet potentially better tolerated alternative for the treatment of certain advanced ovarian cancer patients.
908259_13_ITEM1_P16_S3	The rationale for this ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial is based on preclinical data showing increased antitumor activity of ZYBRESTAT when used in combination with bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody angiogenesis inhibitor targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF, which is approved for the treatment of colorectal cancer, advanced nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer, metastatic kidney cancer and glioblastoma and which is marketed by Genentech/Roche under the name AVASTIN .
908259_13_ITEM1_P16_S4	In addition we have seen complementary clinical activity and good tolerability of combining ZYBRESTAT with bevacizumab in a Phase 1 clinical trial.
908259_13_ITEM1_P16_S5	We also may have an opportunity to begin a clinical trial in advanced or persistent ovarian cancer with ZYBRESTAT in combination with pazopanib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor also targeting VEGF, which is approved for the treatment of renal cell cancer and soft tissue sarcoma and is marketed by GlaxoSmithKline under the name VOTRIENT .
908259_13_ITEM1_P16_S6	This potential clinical study is dependent on receiving funding from an externally funded collaboration.
908259_13_ITEM1_P16_S7	We also hope to begin a clinical trial in recurrent ovarian cancer, subject to funding, with ZYBRESTAT in combination with paclitaxel.
908259_13_ITEM1_P16_S8	We believe that studying ZYBRESTAT in combination with platinum or paclitaxel-based chemotherapy is another potential path forward, since chemotherapy is the current standard of care in this indication.
908259_13_ITEM1_P16_S9	We believe that these three clinical trials, one ongoing and two planned subject to funding, will provide us with multiple clinical strategies for the potential commercialization of Zybrestat in advanced ovarian cancer.
908259_13_ITEM1_P16_S10	Ongoing Clinical Trial in Ovarian Cancer We are currently collaborating on an ongoing randomized Phase 2 clinical trial (GOG1861) of ZYBRESTAT in advanced ovarian cancer in combination with bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody VEGF inhibitor, whose branded name is AVASTIN.
908259_13_ITEM1_P16_S11	The GOG1861 study is expected to enroll a total of 110 patients and more than 80 sites are participating.
908259_13_ITEM1_P16_S12	To be eligible for the study, patients must have recurrent ovarian cancer, and must have received prior platinum-based chemotherapy.
908259_13_ITEM1_P16_S13	Patients are being randomized into two arms: one arm receives bevacizumab; the second arm receives bevacizumab plus ZYBRESTAT.
908259_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	Patients are treated until disease progression or adverse effects prohibit further therapy.
908259_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	The primary endpoint of the Phase 2 trial is progression-free survival.
908259_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	Secondary endpoints include safety, overall survival and objective responses by treatment.
908259_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	If this trial is completed and is clinically successful in terms of slowing tumor progression, we believe that this combination of vascular targeting agents, without the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy agents and their often significant side effects could provide a potentially better tolerated alternative for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer patients.
908259_13_ITEM1_P18_S3	This trial is being conducted by the GOG and is under the sponsorship of CTEP of the National Cancer Institute.
908259_13_ITEM1_P18_S4	The trial is also being done in collaboration with Genentech, the manufacturer of bevacizumab, who, along with us, supplies the drugs for the study in addition to providing some of the trial s funding.
908259_13_ITEM1_P18_S5	While we pay for some costs related to this trial, CTEP bears most of the cost of the trial.
908259_13_ITEM1_P18_S6	In August, 2012, we announced that a pre-specified interim safety analysis of 25 patients in this trial indicated that only one of these patients had suffered a protocol-specified serious adverse event in the trial to date, and therefore it was recommended that the trial should continue to full enrollment.
908259_13_ITEM1_P18_S7	In February, 2013, we announced the results of the second and final scheduled interim toxicity analysis based on the safety review of the first 53 evaluable patients who completed four months of therapy.
908259_13_ITEM1_P18_S8	The results were that there were no additional protocol specified serious adverse events seen during this review, and that the study will continue to full enrollment.
908259_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	We expect that an interim analysis to determine if the trial should continue to full enrollment will be conducted by the second quarter of 2013.
908259_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	We will remain blinded to the data from this interim analysis.
908259_13_ITEM1_P19_S2	If the study continues after this interim analysis we anticipate that preliminary results of the final data set will be available in the first or second quarter of 2014.
908259_13_ITEM1_P19_S3	Assuming a positive outcome from these analysis and results, we hope to be able to collaborate with the GOG and Genentech, and also receive guidance from FDA, on the design of a potential pivotal registration trial in this indication that could lead to an NDA filing in the 2016-2017 timeframe.
908259_13_ITEM1_P19_S4	Planned Clinical Trial in Ovarian Cancer With sufficient funding, we would also like to initiate a Phase 2 study of ZYBRESTAT in combination with weekly paclitaxel in persistent or recurrent ovarian cancer.
908259_13_ITEM1_P19_S5	This would be a multi-center, controlled trial designed to enroll 120 patients in a one-to-one randomization.
908259_13_ITEM1_P19_S6	The primary endpoint would be progression-free survival, with secondary endpoints of safety, overall survival, objective response rate and CA125 response rate.
908259_13_ITEM1_P19_S7	Our target date to begin this trial would be in 2013, if we have sufficient funding.
908259_13_ITEM1_P19_S8	We also may have an opportunity to begin a clinical trial with ZYBRESTAT in combination with pazopanib, an antiangiogenic oral multi-kinase tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in recurrent ovarian cancer.
908259_13_ITEM1_P19_S9	This trial is dependent on receiving funding from an externally funded collaboration.
908259_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	This would be a Phase 1b/2 controlled trial designed to enroll 80 patients in a three-way randomization.
908259_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	Background in Ovarian Cancer Clinical Trials On June 15, 2012, British clinical investigators published results from a Phase 1 study in solid tumors in the journal Clinical Cancer Research, using a combination of ZYBRESTAT with bevacizumab, an angiogenesis inhibitor targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, without cytotoxic chemotherapy.
908259_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	The investigators observed disease stabilization in 9 of 14 treated patients, and a partial response lasting over one year in one patient with ovarian cancer, based on CA125 tumor marker levels.
908259_13_ITEM1_P21_S2	The investigators also observed that functional imaging of the tumors at baseline and after cycle 1 showed longer profound vascular changes and blood-flow shutdown when bevacizumab was added to the ZYBRESTAT treatment regimen, demonstrating the complementary therapeutic effect of ZYBRESTAT and bevacizumab on the tumor vasculature.
908259_13_ITEM1_P21_S3	We believe that this approach of combining vascular targeting agents without chemotherapy represents a potential way forward in clinical evaluation, and it is the basis for our ongoing randomized Phase 2 clinical trial of ZYBRESTAT in advanced ovarian cancer being conducted by the GOG.
908259_13_ITEM1_P21_S4	Additionally, we have seen positive clinical results in prior clinical studies using ZYBRESTAT in conjunction with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer.
908259_13_ITEM1_P21_S5	Final results from a Phase 2 study were published by the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, in the U. K., in the January 2011 issue of Annals of Oncology, showing a response rate of 25% which represents 11 of 44 patients, in a platinum resistant population and an additional 11%, representing 5 of 44 of patients, with unconfirmed responses on CT, suggesting that randomized trials including ZYBRESTAT with platinum or paclitaxel-based chemotherapy should be performed in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.
908259_13_ITEM1_P21_S6	Therefore, in addition to combining ZYBRESTAT with a VEGF-targeting agent as in the GOG study, we also believe that studying ZYBRESTAT in combination with platinum or paclitaxel-based chemotherapy is supported by compelling preclinical and clinical data and may be another potential path forward, since chemotherapy is the current standard of care in this indication.
908259_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	ZYBRESTAT in Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer ATC is an aggressive, rare, lethal cancer of the thyroid gland.
908259_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	Because of the rapid progression of the disease and the absence of effective, approved therapies, median survival from the time of diagnosis is approximately 3-4 months.
908259_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	It is estimated that approximately 800 patients will be diagnosed with ATC in the United States in 2013.
908259_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	Assuming similar incidence rates, this would translate into an estimated 800 new cases of ATC annually in Europe, and 3,800 new cases worldwide in 2013.
908259_13_ITEM1_P23_S3	Due to the aggressive nature of the disease, fewer than 10% of patients are expected to survive one year from diagnosis.
908259_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	We have completed a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of ZYBRESTAT in patients with ATC, or the FACT trial, which enrolled 80 patients over a 3-year time span in over 40 clinical sites worldwide and which represents the largest randomized clinical trial conducted in ATC to date.
908259_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	We have presented the results of this study at multiple scientific meetings, including the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, and the European Society for Medical Oncology, or ESMO, and in scientific journals.
908259_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	In September 2012, we reached agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, regarding a special protocol assessment, or SPA, for a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of ZYBRESTAT in ATC, which we refer to as the FACT 2 trial, and which would require enrolling 300 patients with ATC.
908259_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	This enrollment requirement poses a significant hurdle for us because there are only about 800 patients diagnosed with the disease annually in the United States.
908259_13_ITEM1_P25_S2	While we believe that a positive FACT 2 study would be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval in the United States and in Europe for the treatment of patients with ATC, the required sample size puts this trial beyond our current financial resources.
908259_13_ITEM1_P25_S3	At the present time, we believe that pursuing regulatory approval for ZYBRESTAT in ATC in the EU without the requirement for another clinical trial in ATC is the most fiscally feasible path.
908259_13_ITEM1_P25_S4	We are now exploring regulatory approval for ZYBRESTAT in ATC in the EU with a marketing authorization under exceptional or conditional circumstances, which might allow us to receive approval in Europe without conducting another clinical trial and for substantially less cost.
908259_13_ITEM1_P25_S5	European regulations provide that these special marketing approvals may be obtained in the case of therapies for the treatment of life-threatening diseases with orphan designation where there is an unmet medical need.
908259_13_ITEM1_P25_S6	This approval might enable potential filings in Japan, Korea, China, Canada and other countries as well.
908259_13_ITEM1_P25_S7	We hope to receive scientific advice from two countries in the European Union in the first half of 2013 related to this regulatory approval path.
908259_13_ITEM1_P25_S8	Upon evaluation of the advice from these countries, we would decide whether or not to ask the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for their scientific advice, which we would most likely receive in September or October of 2013.
908259_13_ITEM1_P25_S9	We believe that this path may be a potential alternative path forward which could enable us to potentially receive marketing approval by 2015 or 2016.
908259_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	In December 2011, we established a distribution agreement with Azanta Danmark A/S, or Azanta, to provide access to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of patients with ATC on a compassionate use basis in certain specified territories.
908259_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	This agreement was expanded to include additional territories in August 2012 on a compassionate use basis.
908259_13_ITEM1_P26_S2	The specified territories include the European Union, including the Nordic countries and Switzerland, Canada, Israel and South Korea.
908259_13_ITEM1_P26_S3	This program, which is managed by Azanta, provides a regulatory mechanism to allow healthcare professionals in the specified territories to prescribe ZYBRESTAT to individual ATC patients while it is still in development.
908259_13_ITEM1_P26_S4	Under the terms of the agreement, we provide ZYBRESTAT to Azanta, and Azanta serves as our exclusive distributor for ZYBRESTAT in the specified territories for this purpose.
908259_13_ITEM1_P26_S5	Azanta provides ZYBRESTAT to physicians solely to treat ATC on a compassionate use basis in the specified territories until such time as ZYBRESTAT may obtain marketing approval in that territory.
908259_13_ITEM1_P26_S6	The agreement may be further expanded to include other countries on a country-by-country basis.
908259_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	Azanta is responsible for all regulatory activities necessary to distribute and sell ZYBRESTAT on a compassionate use basis for the treatment of ATC within the specified territories.
908259_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	There is no transfer of ownership of intellectual property rights for ZYBRESTAT to Azanta under the terms of the agreement.
908259_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	Background in ATC In earlier Phase 1 studies of ZYBRESTAT in ATC, clinical investigators observed several objective responses in treatment with ZYBRESTAT, including a complete response lasting more than 13 years, in patients with ATC.
908259_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	A subsequent Phase 2 study in 26 ATC patients showed a 23% rate of one year survival in a disease where median expected survival of patients is approximately 3-4 months from the time of diagnosis and fewer than 10% of patients are typically alive at one year.
908259_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	We subsequently conducted the FACT (fosbretabulin in anaplastic cancer of the thyroid) trial, a randomized Phase 2/3 study in ATC, which enrolled 80 patients between July 2007 and February 2010.
908259_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	A total of 40 clinical sites in 11 countries participated in this clinical study.
908259_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	The trial was originally designed to evaluate ZYBRESTAT in 180 patients as a potential treatment for ATC.
908259_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	The primary endpoint for the FACT trial was overall survival.
908259_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	Eligible patients were randomized to receive either ZYBRESTAT in combination with the chemotherapeutic agents carboplatin and paclitaxel, or to receive only carboplatin and paclitaxel as part of the control group.
908259_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	Due to the rarity of the disease and the fact that many of the patients screened for the study did not meet the trial s inclusion criteria or either died or no longer met the trial s inclusion criteria, the enrollment period spanned more than twice the planned 18 month period.
908259_13_ITEM1_P31_S3	As a result of both the length of the enrollment period and financial constraints affecting us, in February 2010, we chose to continue to treat and follow all 80 patients who were enrolled in the Phase 2/3 FACT clinical trial in ATC but to stop further enrollment.
908259_13_ITEM1_P31_S4	During a meeting on March 16, 2011, the FDA indicated that the data from the FACT trial are suggestive of possible clinical activity that may warrant continued development, and that to seek regulatory approval, we should plan to conduct an additional clinical trial with a survival endpoint.
908259_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	In June 2011, Julie Sosa, M.D., Associate Professor of Surgery and of Medicine at Yale University and principal investigator in the Phase 2/3 study, presented final data from the trial at the ASCO conference in Chicago, Illinois.
908259_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	Dr. Sosa presented data reflecting a median overall survival, or OS, time of 5.2 months for patients who received ZYBRESTAT and chemotherapy compared with 4.0 months for patients receiving chemotherapy alone.
908259_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	Although not statistically significant, this represents a 28% reduction in the risk of death for patients receiving ZYBRESTAT and chemotherapy.
908259_13_ITEM1_P32_S3	For patients treated with ZYBRESTAT and chemotherapy, the data suggested that the likelihood of being alive at six months was 48% compared with 35% for patients treated with the control regimen.
908259_13_ITEM1_P32_S4	At one year, the data suggested that the likelihood of being alive was 26% for patients treated with ZYBRESTAT and chemotherapy compared with 9% for patients treated with chemotherapy alone.
908259_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	As in other studies, ZYBRESTAT appeared to be well tolerated.
908259_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	ZYBRESTAT in Neuroendocrine Tumors with Refractory Carcinoid Syndrome Another indication that we started to pursue in 2012 is the treatment of carcinoid syndrome.
908259_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	In June 2012, we announced the establishment of an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement with Angiogene Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a U.K.-based drug development company relative to their VDA program for neuroendocrine cancers, focused specifically on carcinoid syndrome.
908259_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	We plan to leverage these assets for the development and potential commercialization of ZYBRESTAT to treat refractory carcinoid syndrome associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors involving the liver.
908259_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	In the United States, according to the American Cancer Society, approximately 12,000-15,000 new neuroendocrine tumors, or NETs, are diagnosed annually.
908259_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	Assuming similar incidence rates, this would translate to approximately 25,000-30,000 new cases of NETs annually in the combined markets of Europe and Japan.
908259_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	Neuroendocrine tumors, including carcinoid, are increasing in incidence more rapidly than other cancers, but treatments, including drugs, surgery, or embolization techniques, are not successful for all patients or may provide only temporary relief.
908259_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	These patients live many years with frequent episodes of diarrhea and flushing that, over time, cease to respond to the standard therapy with drugs called somatostatins.
908259_13_ITEM1_P36_S2	The medical need for additional therapeutic options to control the debilitating symptoms of carcinoid syndrome remains acute and may provide an opportunity for us to utilize our technology and experience in developing VDA drugs for the benefit of those patients.
908259_13_ITEM1_P36_S3	Given the compelling scientific basis for using a VDA to disrupt blood flow to induce tumor necrosis and reduce production of biologically active mediators, such as serotonin, which are associated with the most severe, debilitating symptoms of this disease, we plan to investigate the effectiveness of ZYBRESTAT in this setting.
908259_13_ITEM1_P36_S4	We believe that using this approach has the potential to provide a faster path to establishing clinical activity of ZYBRESTAT, as compared to more typical endpoints such as progression-free survival or overall survival, as utilized in our other ongoing programs, and to significantly expand the commercial opportunity and patent protection for ZYBRESTAT.
908259_13_ITEM1_P36_S5	We are conducting preclinical studies and exploring possible clinical studies in this indication, but we would require additional funding to provide the financial resources for such clinical studies.
908259_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	We believe that OXi4503 is differentiated from other VDAs by its dual-action activity: in addition to having potent vascular disrupting effects, OXi4503 is unique in that certain enzymes in the human body can help convert it to a form of chemical that has direct tumor cell killing effects.
908259_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	We believe this unique property may result in enhanced anti-tumor activity in certain tumor types as compared with other VDA drug candidates.
908259_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	Based on data from preclinical studies, we believe that OXi4503 may have enhanced activity in tumor types with relatively high levels of the enzymes that facilitate the conversion of OXi4503 to the form of chemical that kills tumor cells.
908259_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	These tumor types include hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, and leukemias of the myeloid lineage.
908259_13_ITEM1_P38_S2	In preclinical studies, OXi4503 has shown potent anti-tumor activity in solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia models, both as a single agent and in combination with other cancer treatment modalities.
908259_13_ITEM1_P38_S3	Ongoing Clinical Trial in AML with OXi4503 Based on the results of preclinical studies published in the journal Blood in September 2010 that show OXi4503 has potent activity against AML in animal models, we entered into a clinical trial agreement pursuant to which investigators at the University of Florida initiated an investigator sponsored Phase 1 study of OXi4503 in patients with AML or MDS in May 2011.
908259_13_ITEM1_P38_S4	This open-label, dose-escalating study for the treatment of up to 36 patients is being conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory AML and MDS and will evaluate the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose and biologic activity of OXi4503 in these patients.
908259_13_ITEM1_P38_S5	In addition to the University of Florida this study is supported in part by the Leukemia Lymphoma Society.
908259_13_ITEM1_P38_S6	In December 2012, the investigators at the University of Florida presented data from this Phase 1 study at the 2012 annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in Atlanta, Georgia.
908259_13_ITEM1_P38_S7	The clinical data, which was presented as an online abstract, showed responses and a manageable safety profile in this first-in-man trial of a VDA in AML.
908259_13_ITEM1_P38_S8	Results were presented on 5 initial patients with refractory AML enrolled between May, 2011 and August, 2012.
908259_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	Adverse events attributable to OXi4503 infusion included bone pain, fever, anemia and thrombocytopenia.
908259_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	Hypertension was manageable and plasma LDH and uric acid increased by at least two-fold within hours after OXi4503 infusions, suggesting leukemia cell destruction.
908259_13_ITEM1_P39_S2	New patients are continuing to be enrolled in this study.
908259_13_ITEM1_P39_S3	As of March 1, 2013 a total of 9 patients have been enrolled into this study and no dose-limiting adverse events have been encountered at this point.
908259_13_ITEM1_P39_S4	The general direction of future development of OXi4503 for hematologic indications will depend on the outcome of the analysis of the study in AML, as well as available financial resources and potential partnering activities.
908259_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	We have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of OXi4503 in patients with advanced solid tumors sponsored by Cancer Research United Kingdom.
908259_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	In collaboration with us, Professor Gordon Rustin and colleagues from the Mount Vernon Cancer Research Centre, and other institutions in the United Kingdom, reported positive final data from this study at the 2010 ASCO Annual Meeting.
908259_13_ITEM1_P40_S2	In this study, 45 patients with advanced solid tumors who had declined or were unresponsive to standard treatment were treated with escalating doses of OXi4503.
908259_13_ITEM1_P40_S3	Partial responses were observed in two patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and stable disease was observed in 9 patients.
908259_13_ITEM1_P40_S4	OXi4503 was also observed to be well tolerated in this study.
908259_13_ITEM1_P40_S5	To date, OXi4503 has been observed to have a manageable side-effect profile similar to that of other agents in the VDA class, potential single-agent clinical activity, and effects on tumor blood flow and tumor metabolic activity, as determined with several imaging modalities.
908259_13_ITEM1_P40_S6	We also evaluated escalating doses of OXi4503 in an OXiGENE-sponsored Phase 1b trial, initiated in the first quarter of 2009 in patients with solid tumors with hepatic involvement.
908259_13_ITEM1_P40_S7	This study confirmed the recommended dose established in the first Phase 1 study.
908259_13_ITEM1_P40_S8	Currently, we are exploring possible clinical studies but we have no firm plans to continue the evaluation of OXi4503 in patients with solid tumors.
908259_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	conditions that are characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth within the eye that result in loss of vision.
908259_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	While we continue to seek partnership opportunities that will allow us to continue this research, due to financial constraints, we are not actively pursuing development in this area at this time.
908259_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	Background in Ophthalmology In December 2010, we completed a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled Phase 2 proof-of-mechanism trial, which we refer to as the FAVOR trial, with a single dose of intravenously-administered ZYBRESTAT in patients with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, or PCV, a form of choroidal neovascularization, a condition where new blood vessels form in the choroid, a part of the eye, and which can lead to vision loss and, ultimately, blindness.
908259_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	Current therapies, including approved drugs that interfere with blood vessel growth, known as anti-angiogenics, appear to provide limited benefit.
908259_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	We believe that the architecture of the abnormal vasculature in certain eye tissues, namely the retina and choroid, which contribute to PCV patients loss of vision, may be particularly susceptible to treatment with a VDA such as ZYBRESTAT.
908259_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	Data from the FAVOR trial, in which ZYBRESTAT at different doses was compared to placebo in patients with PCV, followed by imaging of the retina on days 2, 8, 15, and 28, were presented at the 6th Asia-Pacific VitreoRetina Society, or APVRS, Congress in Hyderabad, India on December 2, 2011.
908259_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	We believe that a safe, effective and convenient topically-administered anti-vascular therapeutic would have advantages over currently approved anti-vascular, ophthalmological therapeutics, many of which must be injected directly into a patient s eyes, in some cases on a chronic monthly basis.
908259_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	We have also evaluated the requirements for additional preclinical toxicology and efficacy studies with ZYBRESTAT for topical ophthalmological formulations to better position the program for partnering.
908259_13_ITEM1_P45_S2	Further development of this program will depend on the outcome of our evaluation of these requirements and available financial resources.
908259_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	Complete Company Background We are a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 1988 in the state of New York and reincorporated in 1992 in the state of Delaware, with our principal corporate office in the United States at 701 Gateway Boulevard, Suite 210, South San Francisco, California 94080 (telephone: (650) 635-7000, fax: (650) 635-7001).
908259_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, are available to you free of charge through the Investors section of our web site as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
908259_13_ITEM1_P46_S2	Information contained on our web site does not form a part of this Form 10-K. Vascular Disrupting Agents: Anti-Vascular Therapeutics that Address a Large Potential Market According to Cancer Research UK, a cancer organization in the United Kingdom, nearly 90% of all cancers, more than 200 types, are solid tumors, which are dependent upon a continually developing vascular supply for their growth and survival.
908259_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	Similarly, in the ophthalmology field, abnormal neovascularization characterizes a variety of ophthalmological diseases and conditions, including corneal neovascularization, central retinal vein occlusion, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, sickle cell retinopathy, myopic macular degeneration, or MMD, age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, and neovascular glaucoma.
908259_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	Since 2004, multiple drugs that interfere with blood vessel growth or anti-angiogenics (see table below), have been approved for a variety of cancer and ophthalmology indications, and development of approved anti-angiogenic drugs for new indications continues.
908259_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	Physician adoption of these first-generation anti-vascular drugs has been rapid and continues to accelerate.
908259_13_ITEM1_P48_S2	We believe that our VDA drug candidates are second-generation anti-vascular drugs that differ from and are complementary and non-competitive with anti-angiogenic agents.
908259_13_ITEM1_P48_S3	Similar to anti-angiogenic agents, our VDA drug candidates are anti-vascular drugs that exert therapeutic effects by depriving tumors and in the case of eye disease, ocular lesions of blood supply.
908259_13_ITEM1_P48_S4	We also believe that our VDA therapeutics may be better tolerated than anti-angiogenic drugs and may potentially have utility in later-stage tumors that have become unresponsive to anti-angiogenic therapies.
908259_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	In September 2006, we announced the publication of a research article in the journal Science that provided strong scientific evidence for combining VDAs with anti-angiogenic agents such as bevacizumab, a widely-used anti-angiogenic drug that acts by inhibiting VEGF, a pro-angiogenic growth factor.
908259_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	In this article, Professor Kerbel and Dr. Shaked from Sunnybrook Cancer Centre in Canada demonstrated that the combination of ZYBRESTAT and an anti-angiogenic agent, an anti-VEGF-receptor antibody, had synergistic effects on tumors.
908259_13_ITEM1_P49_S2	In December 2007, we completed a Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate ZYBRESTAT in combination with bevacizumab (an approved and widely-used anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody) in patients with advanced solid tumors.
908259_13_ITEM1_P49_S3	This was the first human clinical trial to pair a vascular disrupting agent and an anti-angiogenic drug in the treatment of cancer, specifically in patients who had failed previous treatments and were in advanced stages of disease.
908259_13_ITEM1_P49_S4	The trial was an open-label, multi-center trial designed to determine the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of ZYBRESTAT administered intravenously in combination with bevacizumab.
908259_13_ITEM1_P49_S5	Three dose levels of ZYBRESTAT were evaluated in combination with an approved dose of bevacizumab.
908259_13_ITEM1_P49_S6	In May of 2008, we reported final data from the trial showing that the two-drug combination appeared to be well-tolerated with early signs of clinical efficacy, including 9 of 16 patients with stable disease responses and with prolonged stable disease observed in several patients) and additive effects on tumor blood-flow inhibition.
908259_13_ITEM1_P49_S7	We believe that these preclinical and clinical research results suggest combining VDA and anti-angiogenic therapies may be a compelling strategy to maximize the therapeutic potential of VDAs and anti-angiogenic drugs in the treatment of solid tumors.
908259_13_ITEM1_P49_S8	We believe the potential ability to synergistically combine VDA drugs with anti-angiogenic therapeutics affords it a wide range of future development and commercialization options with our VDA drug candidates, including tumor types and treatment settings where anti-angiogenic drugs are commonly utilized, as well as those where anti-angiogenic agents are either poorly tolerated, ineffective, no longer effective, or not commonly utilized.
908259_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	As illustrated in the table below, VDA and anti-angiogenic drugs act via different mechanisms to produce complementary biological and anti-vascular effects with mostly non-overlapping side effects.
908259_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	In preclinical studies, VDA plus anti-angiogenic drug combinations demonstrate robust and additive anti-tumor effects.
908259_13_ITEM1_P50_S2	Results from initial human clinical studies conducted by us with combinations of ZYBRESTAT and the widely-used anti-angiogenic drug, bevacizumab, provide support and initial clinical validation for combining these agents to significantly increase clinical activity without significantly increasing side-effects.
908259_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	Chronic-chronic hypertension with long-term use Acute-impairment in wound healing, hemorrhage, hemoptysis, gastrointestinal perforation, proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, thromboembolic events, etc.
908259_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	Transient and manageable-Mostly hypertension, effectively controlled Non-overlapping with anti-angiogenics No cumulative toxicities alone or in combination We believe our VDA drug candidates act on tumor blood vessels via two complementary mechanisms, tubulin depolymerization and disengagement of the junctional protein VE-cadherin, which cause shape change in tumor vascular endothelial cells, vessel occlusion and collapse, and the subsequent blockage of blood-flow to the tumor, which deprives it of oxygen and nutrients essential for survival.
908259_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	In vitro studies have demonstrated that our VDA drug candidates act in a reversible fashion on a protein called tubulin inside newly-formed and growing endothelial cells, such as the vascular endothelial cells comprising tumor vasculature.
908259_13_ITEM1_P52_S2	By binding to the tubulin, ZYBRESTAT is able to collapse the structural framework that maintains the cells flat shape.
908259_13_ITEM1_P52_S3	When this occurs, the shape of the cells changes from flat to round, initiating a cascade of events resulting in physical blockage of the blood vessels.
908259_13_ITEM1_P52_S4	The resulting shutdown in blood-flow then deprives tumor cells of the oxygen and nutrients necessary for maintenance and growth and also prevents tumor cells from being able to excrete toxic metabolic waste products.
908259_13_ITEM1_P52_S5	The consequence of the blockage is extensive tumor cell death, as demonstrated in animal studies and suggested in imaging studies of human patients treated with ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503.
908259_13_ITEM1_P52_S6	Preclinical research, published in the November 2005 issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation , showed that ZYBRESTAT also disrupts the molecular engagement of VE-cadherin, a junctional protein important for endothelial cell survival and function.
908259_13_ITEM1_P52_S7	The authors of the research article conclude that this effect only occurs in endothelial cells which lack contact with smooth muscle cells, a known feature of abnormal vasculature associated with tumors and other disease processes.
908259_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	The disengagement of VE-cadherin leads to endothelial cell detachment, which in turn, can cause permanent physical blockage of vessels.
908259_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	Preclinical and clinical study results indicate that ZYBRESTAT exerts anti-vascular effects rapidly, within hours of administration, and the half-life of the active form of ZYBRESTAT in humans is approximately four hours.
908259_13_ITEM1_P54_S1	Because the half-life of the active form of ZYBRESTAT is relatively short, the effects of ZYBRESTAT on tubulin are reversible, and ZYBRESTAT is typically administered no more frequently than once per week, the side-effects of ZYBRESTAT are typically transient in nature, limited to the period of time following administration when the active form of ZYBRESTAT is in the body in significant concentrations.
908259_13_ITEM1_P54_S2	This contrasts with drugs that interfere with blood vessel growth, known as anti-angiogenic agents, which are typically administered on a chronic basis so as to constantly maintain levels of drug in the body, exert their tumor blood-vessel growth inhibiting effects over days to weeks, and as a result can cause a variety of chronic side-effects that are not limited to the immediate period following administration.
908259_13_ITEM1_P54_S3	In contrast with anti-angiogenic agents, which can cause a variety of chronic side-effects, side-effects associated with ZYBRESTAT are typically transient and manageable.
908259_13_ITEM1_P54_S4	The most frequent ZYBRESTAT side-effects include infusion-related side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache and fatigue, and tumor pain, which is consistent with the drug s mechanism-of-action.
908259_13_ITEM1_P54_S5	Like approved anti-angiogenic drugs, ZYBRESTAT also exhibits cardiovascular effects, which in the majority of patients are mild and transient in nature.
908259_13_ITEM1_P54_S6	Approximately 10-20% of patients treated with ZYBRESTAT experience clinically-significant and transient hypertension that can be readily managed and prevented after initial occurrence with straightforward oral anti-hypertensive therapy.
908259_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	was less than 3%, a frequency comparable to that reported with approved anti-angiogenic agents such as bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib.
908259_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	Our strategy is to develop innovative therapeutics for oncology and to leverage our drug candidates and technology in the field of ophthalmology.
908259_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	Our principal focus is to advance the clinical development of our drug candidates ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503 and to identify new preclinical candidates that are complementary to our VDAs.
908259_13_ITEM1_P56_S2	To advance our strategy, we have established relationships with universities, research organizations and other institutions in these fields.
908259_13_ITEM1_P56_S3	We intend to continue to rely on these relationships, rather than expand our in-house research and development staff.
908259_13_ITEM1_P56_S4	In general, these programs are created, developed and controlled by our internal management.
908259_13_ITEM1_P56_S5	Currently, we have collaborative agreements and arrangements with a number of institutions in the United States and abroad, which we utilize to perform the day-to-day activities associated with drug development.
908259_13_ITEM1_P56_S6	In 2012, collaborations were ongoing with a variety of university and research institutions, including the following:
908259_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	Gynecologic Oncology Group, or GOG, and the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, or CTEP, of the National Cancer Institute, or NCI.
908259_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	University of Florida We have secured a technology license from Arizona State University, or ASU.
908259_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	The ASU license is an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license for commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including among others, ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503.
908259_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	Combretastatins were originally isolated from the bark of the South African Bush Willow tree by researchers from Arizona State University but are now created by synthetic means and have tubulin-dependent anti-vascular and antiproliferative properties.
908259_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	Under the ASU license, we have the right to grant sublicenses.
908259_13_ITEM1_P60_S1	ASU is entitled to single-digit royalty and milestone payments under the license agreement.
908259_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	We bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the ASU license.
908259_13_ITEM1_P61_S1	Under the license agreement, we have agreed to diligently proceed with the development, manufacture and sale of products using the licensed technology.
908259_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	ASU has the first responsibility of enforcing patents under the license agreement.
908259_13_ITEM1_P62_S1	Either party may terminate the license agreement upon material default or bankruptcy of the other party.
908259_13_ITEM1_P62_S2	In addition, we may terminate the agreement by either (i) determining that filing for regulatory approval is not warranted by the clinical testing date or (ii) by providing two months written notice of our intent to terminate the agreement.
908259_13_ITEM1_P62_S3	Payments made to ASU to date have amounted to $2,500,000.
908259_13_ITEM1_P62_S4	The agreement remains in force until the expiration of the last to expire patent subject to the ASU license.
908259_13_ITEM1_P62_S5	Under a sponsored research agreement with Baylor University, we are pursuing discovery and development of additional novel, small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, including small-molecule cathepsin-L inhibitors and hypoxia-activated VDAs.
908259_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	Cathepsin-L is an enzyme involved in protein degradation and has been shown to be closely involved in the processes of angiogenesis and metastasis.
908259_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	Small molecule inhibitors may have the potential to slow tumor growth and metastasis in a manner we believe could be complementary with our VDA therapeutics.
908259_13_ITEM1_P64_S1	We believe that our hypoxia-activated VDAs could serve as line-extension products to ZYBRESTAT and/or OXi4503.
908259_13_ITEM1_P64_S2	We also have a an exclusive license from Baylor University to all novel compositions developed for the treatment of vascular disorders, inflammation, parasitic diseases and infections, fungal diseases and infections and/or cancer.
908259_13_ITEM1_P64_S3	We have the right to grant sublicenses under the Baylor license.
908259_13_ITEM1_P65_S0	through use of Baylor s compounds.
908259_13_ITEM1_P65_S1	Further, commencing in the first year that we provide no research funding to Baylor University we must pay a minimum annual royalty payment of $40,000.
908259_13_ITEM1_P65_S2	We are not required to pay Baylor for use of Baylor s compounds other than pursuant to this royalty arrangement.
908259_13_ITEM1_P65_S3	We are entitled to file, prosecute and maintain patent applications on products for which we have a license under this agreement.
908259_13_ITEM1_P65_S4	We have made a one-time payment of $50,000 for the licensing fee that was used as a credit against research expenses generated by Baylor.
908259_13_ITEM1_P65_S5	Either party may terminate the license agreement upon material default of the other party.
908259_13_ITEM1_P65_S6	The term of the license shall end upon the expiration of the licensed patents.
908259_13_ITEM1_P65_S7	The latest U.S. patent licensed under this agreement is scheduled to expire in June 2030.
908259_13_ITEM1_P65_S8	We also have an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, for commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including among others, ZYBRESTAT.
908259_13_ITEM1_P65_S9	Under the BMS license, we have the right to grant sublicenses.
908259_13_ITEM1_P65_S10	Under the license agreement, BMS is entitled to low-single-digit royalty payments for all commercial sales plus any remuneration OXiGENE receives for sale of ZYBRESTAT under named patient or compassionate use programs.
908259_13_ITEM1_P65_S11	All licensing fees and milestone payments under the license agreement, in the aggregate amount of $1,080,000, have been paid.
908259_13_ITEM1_P66_S0	We bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the BMS license and have a right, but not a duty, of enforcing patents covered by the license.
908259_13_ITEM1_P66_S1	Either party may terminate the license upon material default of the other party.
908259_13_ITEM1_P66_S2	The term of the license shall end upon the expiration of the licensed patents.
908259_13_ITEM1_P66_S3	The latest United States patent licensed under this agreement is scheduled to expire in December 2021, excluding a patent term extension available under the Hatch-Waxman Act.
908259_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	REGULATORY MATTERS Government Regulation and Product Approval Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing.
908259_13_ITEM1_P67_S1	Our drugs must be approved by FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States.
908259_13_ITEM1_P68_S0	In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations.
908259_13_ITEM1_P68_S1	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
908259_13_ITEM1_P68_S2	Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions.
908259_13_ITEM1_P68_S3	These sanctions could include the FDA s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusal of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties.
908259_13_ITEM1_P68_S4	Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
908259_13_ITEM1_P69_S0	The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
908259_13_ITEM1_P70_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA.
908259_13_ITEM1_P70_S1	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
908259_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development it enters the preclinical testing stage.
908259_13_ITEM1_P71_S1	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies.
908259_13_ITEM1_P71_S2	An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND.
908259_13_ITEM1_P71_S3	The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation.
908259_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	Preclinical testing continues even after the IND is submitted.
908259_13_ITEM1_P72_S1	The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold.
908259_13_ITEM1_P72_S2	In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.
908259_13_ITEM1_P72_S3	Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
908259_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practice regulations.
908259_13_ITEM1_P73_S1	These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
908259_13_ITEM1_P73_S2	Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution.
908259_13_ITEM1_P73_S3	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
908259_13_ITEM1_P73_S4	The IRB also approves the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the study until completed.
908259_13_ITEM1_P73_S5	Each new clinical protocol must be submitted to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval.
908259_13_ITEM1_P73_S6	Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and efficacy in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.
908259_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
908259_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
908259_13_ITEM1_P75_S1	In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
908259_13_ITEM1_P76_S0	Phase 2: Involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate preliminary efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
908259_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites.
908259_13_ITEM1_P77_S1	These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling.
908259_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	During the development of a new drug, sponsors may, under certain circumstances request a special protocol assessment, or SPA, from the FDA.
908259_13_ITEM1_P78_S1	For example, a sponsor may request an SPA of a protocol for a clinical trial that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in an NDA.
908259_13_ITEM1_P78_S2	The request, which must be made prior to commencing the trial, must include the proposed protocol and protocol-specific questions that the sponsor would like the FDA to answer regarding the protocol design, study goals and data analysis for the proposed investigation.
908259_13_ITEM1_P79_S0	If an SPA is appropriate, the FDA will base its assessment on the questions posed by the sponsor.
908259_13_ITEM1_P79_S1	Comments from the FDA review team are supposed to be sent to the sponsor within 45 calendar days of receipt of the request.
908259_13_ITEM1_P79_S2	The sponsor may request a meeting to discuss the comments and any remaining issues and uncertainties regarding the protocol.
908259_13_ITEM1_P79_S3	If the sponsor and the FDA reach agreement regarding the protocol, the agreement will be documented and made part of the administrative record.
908259_13_ITEM1_P79_S4	This agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins, except (1) with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or (2) if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began.
908259_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA.
908259_13_ITEM1_P80_S1	IND Safety Reports must be submitted to the FDA, IRBs and the investigators for (a) any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected; (b) any findings from epidemiological studies, pooled analysis of multiple studies, or clinical studies (other than those already reported in (a); (c) any findings from animal or in vitro testing, whether or not conducted by the sponsor, that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug, such as reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure; and (d) any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
908259_13_ITEM1_P80_S2	Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
908259_13_ITEM1_P80_S3	The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
908259_13_ITEM1_P80_S4	Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
908259_13_ITEM1_P81_S0	Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
908259_13_ITEM1_P81_S1	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug.
908259_13_ITEM1_P81_S2	Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
908259_13_ITEM1_P81_S3	The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product.
908259_13_ITEM1_P81_S4	The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances, which may include orphan drug status and the first NDA application for a company.
908259_13_ITEM1_P81_S5	In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective.
908259_13_ITEM1_P81_S6	The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
908259_13_ITEM1_P81_S7	Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
908259_13_ITEM1_P82_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing.
908259_13_ITEM1_P82_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing.
908259_13_ITEM1_P82_S2	In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information.
908259_13_ITEM1_P82_S3	The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
908259_13_ITEM1_P83_S0	Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
908259_13_ITEM1_P83_S1	The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
908259_13_ITEM1_P83_S2	The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
908259_13_ITEM1_P84_S0	criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information.
908259_13_ITEM1_P84_S1	Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
908259_13_ITEM1_P84_S2	Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
908259_13_ITEM1_P84_S3	The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA.
908259_13_ITEM1_P85_S0	The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product s identity, strength, quality and purity.
908259_13_ITEM1_P86_S0	Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.
908259_13_ITEM1_P86_S1	The FDA will also inspect selected clinical sites that participated in the clinical studies and may inspect the testing facilities that performed the GLP toxicology studies cited in the NDA.
908259_13_ITEM1_P87_S0	NDAs receive either standard or priority review.
908259_13_ITEM1_P87_S1	A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review.
908259_13_ITEM1_P87_S2	In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
908259_13_ITEM1_P87_S3	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials.
908259_13_ITEM1_P87_S4	Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process.
908259_13_ITEM1_P88_S0	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
908259_13_ITEM1_P88_S1	In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized.
908259_13_ITEM1_P89_S0	Orphan Drug Designation Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug.
908259_13_ITEM1_P89_S1	Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA.
908259_13_ITEM1_P89_S2	After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
908259_13_ITEM1_P89_S3	Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
908259_13_ITEM1_P89_S4	If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years.
908259_13_ITEM1_P89_S5	Orphan drug exclusivity, however, also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor s product for the same indication or disease.
908259_13_ITEM1_P90_S0	In the European Union and Japan, orphan drug exclusivity regulations provide for 10 years of marketing exclusivity for orphan drugs that are approved for the treatment of rare diseases or conditions.
908259_13_ITEM1_P90_S1	ZYBRESTAT was awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of anaplastic, medullary, Stage IV papillary and Stage IV follicular thyroid cancers, acute myelogenous leukemia and ovarian cancer.
908259_13_ITEM1_P90_S2	ZYBRESTAT was also awarded orphan drug status by the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer.
908259_13_ITEM1_P91_S0	Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, we cannot be sure that the FDA will not later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened.
908259_13_ITEM1_P91_S1	Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments.
908259_13_ITEM1_P92_S0	Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied.
908259_13_ITEM1_P92_S1	Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review.
908259_13_ITEM1_P93_S0	Drugs that receive an accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect of a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
908259_13_ITEM1_P93_S1	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials.
908259_13_ITEM1_P93_S2	The FDA has granted Fast Track designation to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of regionally advanced and/or metastatic ATC.
908259_13_ITEM1_P94_S0	Foreign Regulation Before our products can be marketed outside of the United States, they are subject to regulatory approval similar to that required in the United States, although the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, including additional clinical trials that may be required, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country.
908259_13_ITEM1_P94_S1	No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country.
908259_13_ITEM1_P95_S0	The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval.
908259_13_ITEM1_P95_S1	In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved.
908259_13_ITEM1_P95_S2	The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted.
908259_13_ITEM1_P95_S3	Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices may not be approved for such product.
908259_13_ITEM1_P96_S0	In Europe, marketing authorizations may be submitted through a centralized, a decentralized or mutual recognition procedure.
908259_13_ITEM1_P96_S1	The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all European Union members states.
908259_13_ITEM1_P96_S2	The centralized procedure is also mandatory for cancer indications and orphan drug products.
908259_13_ITEM1_P96_S3	Based on these requirements, the centralized procedure would be used for OXiGENE products for ATC or for ovarian cancer indications.
908259_13_ITEM1_P97_S0	In Europe, alternative pathways for marketing approval include conditional approval or approval under exceptional circumstances.
908259_13_ITEM1_P97_S1	These pathways are available for drugs to treat serious or debilitating diseases and/or orphan drugs.
908259_13_ITEM1_P98_S0	Both conditional approval and approval under exceptional circumstances require a positive risk/benefit balance.
908259_13_ITEM1_P98_S1	Under conditional approval it is expected that additional clinical studies would support the lack of comprehensive clinical data provided at the time of the filing.
908259_13_ITEM1_P98_S2	Approval under exceptional circumstances is possible when the indication is so rare that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive clinical data.
908259_13_ITEM1_P98_S3	We are evaluating the potential benefits of seeking approval under exceptional circumstances for the use of ZYBRESTAT in ATC.
908259_13_ITEM1_P98_S4	We cannot assure you that this pathway will be acceptable for marketing approval in Europe.
908259_13_ITEM1_P98_S5	We actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including chemical species, compositions and forms, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, as well as modified forms of naturally-expressed receptors, in the United States and other jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets.
908259_13_ITEM1_P98_S6	We also rely upon trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information.
908259_13_ITEM1_P99_S0	including the European Union, Canada and Japan.
908259_13_ITEM1_P99_S1	Our policy is to file U.S. and foreign patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business.
908259_13_ITEM1_P99_S2	There can be no assurance that any of these patent applications will result in the grant of a patent either in the United States or elsewhere, or that any patents granted will be valid and enforceable, or will provide a competitive advantage or will afford protection against competitors with similar technologies.
908259_13_ITEM1_P99_S3	We also intend to rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel drugs.
908259_13_ITEM1_P99_S4	We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements.
908259_13_ITEM1_P99_S5	We consider the following U.S. patents owned by or exclusively licensed to us to be particularly important to the protection of our most advanced product candidates.
908259_13_ITEM1_P100_S0	In addition to these patents, for some of our product candidates, we have patents and/or applications that cover a particular form or composition, use for a particular indication, use as part of combination therapy or method of preparation or use, as well as other pending patent applications.
908259_13_ITEM1_P100_S1	These issued patents, including any patents that issue from pending applications, could provide additional or a longer period of protection.
908259_13_ITEM1_P100_S2	We also have patent applications pending that seek equivalent or substantially comparable protection for our product candidates in jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets.
908259_13_ITEM1_P101_S0	The patent expiration dates referenced above do not reflect any potential patent term extension that we may receive under the federal Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
908259_13_ITEM1_P101_S1	The Hatch-Waxman Act generally permits a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
908259_13_ITEM1_P101_S2	Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years.
908259_13_ITEM1_P102_S0	The patent term restoration period is generally one-half of the time between the effective date of an investigational new drug application, or IND, and the submission date of a new drug application, or NDA, plus the time between the submission date and approval date of an NDA.
908259_13_ITEM1_P102_S1	Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent.
908259_13_ITEM1_P103_S0	The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for patent term extension.
908259_13_ITEM1_P104_S0	COMPETITION The industry in which we are engaged is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition.
908259_13_ITEM1_P104_S1	Our competitors include, among others, major pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, many of which have financial, technical and marketing resources significantly greater than ours.
908259_13_ITEM1_P104_S2	In addition, many of the small companies that compete with us have also formed collaborative relationships with large, established companies to support research, development, clinical trials and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours.
908259_13_ITEM1_P104_S3	Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or through joint ventures or other collaborations.
908259_13_ITEM1_P105_S0	We are aware of a limited number of companies involved in the development of VDAs.
908259_13_ITEM1_P105_S1	Such companies include Bionomics, Epicept, Nereus and MediciNova, all of which have VDAs that we believe are at an earlier or similar stage of clinical development than our lead drug candidate, ZYBRESTAT.
908259_13_ITEM1_P106_S0	We expect that, if any of our products gain regulatory approval for sale, they will compete primarily on the basis of product efficacy, safety, patient convenience, reliability, price and patent protection.
908259_13_ITEM1_P106_S1	Our competitive position will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop effective proprietary products and implement joint ventures or other alliances with large pharmaceutical companies in order to jointly market and manufacture our products.
908259_13_ITEM1_P106_S2	EMPLOYEES We expect to continue to maintain a relatively small number of executives and other employees.
908259_13_ITEM1_P106_S3	We rely on outsourcing much of our research, development, preclinical testing and clinical trial activity, although we maintain managerial and quality control over our clinical trials.
908259_13_ITEM1_P106_S4	As of March 1, 2013, we had a total of seven full-time employees and approximately three employees working on a part-time basis.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	statements that may be made by the Company or by officers, directors or employees of the Company acting on the Company s behalf, that are not historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results of the Company to be materially different from the historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors set forth below.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We will be required to raise additional funds to finance our operations, continue the development of our product candidates and remain a going concern; we may not be able to do so when necessary, and/or the terms of any financings may not be advantageous to us.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Negative cash flows from our operations are expected to continue over at least the next several years.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our cash utilization amount is highly dependent on the progress of our product development programs, particularly, the results of our preclinical and clinical studies and those of our partners, the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory approval for our product candidates, the terms and conditions of our contracts with service providers for these programs, and the rate of recruitment of patients in our human clinical trials.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P1_S5	In addition, the further development of our ongoing clinical trials will depend on upcoming analysis and results of those studies and our financial resources at that time.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P1_S6	We are aggressively pursuing forms of capital infusion including public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements with organizations that have capabilities and/or products that are complementary to our own capabilities and/or products, in order to continue the development of our product candidates.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P1_S7	However, there can be no assurances that we will complete any financings strategic alliances or collaborative development agreements, and the terms of such arrangements may not be advantageous to us.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P1_S8	We expect our existing cash and cash equivalents to support our operations through the middle of the fourth quarter of 2013.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P1_S9	However, this level of cash utilization does not provide for the initiation of any projects to further the development of our most advanced product candidates.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P1_S10	Any significant further development of ZYBRESTAT or other capital intensive activities will be contingent upon our ability to raise additional capital in addition to our existing financing arrangements.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	any, that we devote to develop manufacturing methods and advanced technologies; our ability to enter into licensing arrangements, including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs; the costs and expenses of filing, prosecuting and, if necessary, enforcing our patent claims, or defending against possible claims of infringement by third-party patent or other technology rights; the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, if any, undertaken by us; and, if and when approved, the demand for our products, which demand depends in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known, understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval, including the range of indications for which any product is granted approval.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	While we have access to certain amounts of financing through an agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC and through an At Market Issuance Sales Arrangement, which we refer to as the ATM, with MLV Co. LLC, these arrangements alone will not be sufficient to fund a late-stage clinical trial of ZYBRESTAT in any indication.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we will not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we will be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs or cease operations.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Any additional equity financing, whether through the ATM, the Lincoln Park Capital arrangement or otherwise, may be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish, on terms that are not favorable to us, rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our failure to raise capital when needed will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our ability to raise additional capital could also be impaired if our common shares lose their status on The NASDAQ Capital Market.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	As a result of this uncertainty and the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as of December 31, 2012 the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm at the beginning of the Financial Statements section in this Form 10-K includes a going concern explanatory paragraph.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our facility with Lincoln Park Capital will not be sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements for all of our contemplated clinical trials.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In November 2011, we entered into a purchase agreement for the sale, from time to time, of up to $20,000,000 of our common stock to Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, or LPC, a Chicago-based institutional investor.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We do not have the ability to sell shares under this arrangement if we fail to maintain a minimum stock price of $6.00 or if we fail to maintain the effectiveness of a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If our stock price rises above $6.00 and the other conditions of the arrangement are met, we may direct LPC to purchase up to $20,000,000 worth of shares of our common stock under our agreement over a 36-month period, in amounts of up to $200,000, which amounts may be increased under certain circumstances.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	The price of our common stock as of March 1, 2013 was $4.06 and therefore the facility is not available to us at this time.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P5_S4	The funding from LPC is not available at this time and may not be available when needed, or at all, depending on the market price of our common stock.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P5_S5	The extent to which we rely on LPC as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors, including the prevailing market price of our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P5_S6	If obtaining sufficient funding from LPC were to prove impracticable or prohibitively dilutive, we will need to secure another source of funding in order to satisfy our working capital needs.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Even if we sell the maximum amount we are eligible to sell to LPC under the purchase agreement, we will still need additional capital to fully implement our business, operating and development plans.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P5_S9	Our facility with MLV will not be sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements for all of our contemplated clinical trials.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	On July 21, 2010, we entered into an at the market equity offering sales agreement, or ATM Agreement, with MLV Co. LLC (MLV), pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through MLV acting as our sales agent and underwriter.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by MLV and us.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	MLV uses its commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock from time to time, based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits we may impose).
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We pay MLV a commission rate of up to 7.0% of the gross sales price per share of any common stock sold through MLV as agent under the ATM Agreement.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The funding available from MLV may not be available when needed, or at all, depending on the market price of our common stock.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The extent to which we rely on MLV as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors, including the prevailing market price of our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S4	If obtaining sufficient funding from MLV were to prove impracticable or prohibitively dilutive, we will need to secure another source of funding in order to satisfy our working capital needs.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Even if we sell the maximum amount we are eligible to sell to MLV under the purchase agreement, we will still need additional capital to fully implement our business, operating and development plans.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Due in part to our constrained financial resources, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates or those that are in-licensed, and/or we may be unable to pursue the clinical trials that we would like to pursue.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S8	We have limited technical, managerial and financial resources to determine the indications on which we should focus the development efforts related to our product candidates.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S9	Due to our limited available financial resources, we have had to curtail clinical development programs and activities that might otherwise have led to more rapid progress of our product candidates through the regulatory and development processes.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S10	We may make incorrect determinations with regard to the indications and clinical trials on which to focus the available resources that we do have.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S11	Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S12	We or our partners currently are pursuing clinical trials in ovarian cancer, ATC and solid tumors, but we are required by our financial resources to engage only in limited clinical activities.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S13	The decisions to allocate our research, management and financial resources toward particular indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S14	Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate drug development programs may also cause us to miss valuable opportunities.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S15	In addition, from time to time, we may in-license or otherwise acquire product candidates to supplement our internal development activities.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S16	Those activities may use resources that otherwise would have been devoted to our internal programs.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S17	We cannot assure you that any resources that we devote to acquired or in-licensed programs will result in any products that are superior to our internally developed products.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S18	If we or the third parties on which we rely for the conduct of our clinical trials and results do not perform our clinical trial activities in accordance with good clinical practices and related regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S19	We use independent clinical investigators and, in many cases, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct and/or oversee the clinical trials of our product candidates and expect to continue to do so.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S20	We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S21	Nonetheless, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the FDA s requirements and our general investigational plan and protocol.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S22	Currently our only clinical trial activities involving ZYBRESTAT are being conducted by physician clinical investigators who are independent of us, but with whom we have agreements for them to provide the results of their clinical trials to us.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P8_S23	In order for us to rely on data from these ongoing studies in support of a marketing application, or NDA, for approval of any of our product candidates by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the independent investigators are required to comply with FDA requirements applicable to their studies.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or the respective trial plans and protocols.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates or result in enforcement action against us.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In February 2012, we were inspected by the FDA, and in March 2012, we received a Form FDA 483 containing observations from that inspection.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The Form FDA 483 noted observations of certain deficiencies in the conduct of our FACT trial in ATC, which was conducted from July 2007 February 2010.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	These observations related to the FDA s good clinical practice requirements and included the failure to insure proper monitoring of third party clinical investigators who were participants in our FACT trial, the failure to promptly bring non-compliant clinical investigators into compliance, and the selection of clinical trial monitors by our clinical research organizations, or CROs, outside the United States who were not sufficiently qualified by experience and training to monitor clinical trials.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	The Form FDA 483 also included observations related to the failure to address the improper storage of a drug that was being used in the trial, and the failure to maintain records and case histories in compliance with FDA regulations.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The issues noted in the Form FDA 483 had previously been identified and addressed by our management as part of an internal review, first disclosed by us in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, of our systems, practices and procedures governing the areas of vendor oversight, quality, and regulatory compliance.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our response to the Form FDA 483 describes the corrective actions that we have taken and will continue to take in response to this matter.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	While we have taken steps and are taking further steps promptly to strengthen our procedures in order to ensure that these issues will not recur in any future clinical trials sponsored by us for any of our product candidates, we cannot assure you that the FDA will be satisfied with our response, that the FDA will not issue a warning letter or take other enforcement action against us, or that similar issues will not recur in the future.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	The results of this inspection may cause the FDA to disqualify some or all of the data from the FACT trial and not consider it in any future NDA for ZYBRESTAT, which could result in delays or difficulties in obtaining the regulatory approvals that will be required to market ZYBRESTAT.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P11_S4	In addition, the steps we take to strengthen our procedures and conduct future clinical trials necessary for approval will be time-consuming and expensive, and we believe, but cannot assure you, that those steps will be sufficient to address the issues that were identified by the FDA in the Form FDA 483.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Our product candidates have not completed clinical trials, and may never demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in order to do so.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Our product candidates are in an early stage of development.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P11_S7	In order to achieve profitable operations, we alone or in collaboration with others, must successfully develop, manufacture, introduce and market our products.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P11_S8	The time frame necessary to achieve market success for any individual product is long and uncertain.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P11_S9	The products currently under development by us will require significant additional research and development and extensive preclinical and clinical testing prior to application for commercial use.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	A number of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after showing promising results in early or later-stage studies or clinical trials.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Although we have obtained some favorable results to-date in preclinical studies and clinical trials of certain of our potential products, such results may not be indicative of results that will ultimately be obtained in or throughout such clinical trials, and clinical trials may not show any of our products to be safe or capable of producing a desired result.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Additionally, we may encounter problems in our clinical trials that will cause us to delay, suspend or terminate those clinical trials.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Further, our research or product development efforts may not be successfully completed, any compounds currently under development by us may not be successfully developed into drugs, any potential products may not receive regulatory approval on a timely basis, if at all, and competitors may develop and bring to market products or technologies that render our potential products obsolete.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P12_S4	If any of these problems occur, our business would be materially and adversely affected.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P12_S5	We have only a limited number of employees to manage and operate our business As announced on September 1, 2011, we have implemented a restructuring plan designed to focus our capital resources on our most promising early-stage clinical programs and further reduce our cash utilization.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	This restructuring plan involved a reduction in force of 11 full-time equivalent employees, or approximately 61%.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	As of March 1, 2013, we had a total of 7 full-time employees and approximately 3 employees working on a part-time basis.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	This reduction in force and focus on reducing cash utilization requires us to manage and operate our business in a highly efficient manner.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We have a history of losses, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S5	We have experienced net losses every year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2012 had an accumulated deficit of approximately $225,432,000.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S6	We anticipate continuing to incur substantial additional losses over at least the next several years due to, among other factors, the need to expend substantial amounts on our continuing clinical trials with respect to our VDA drug candidates, technologies, and anticipated research and development activities and the general and administrative expenses associated with those activities.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S7	We have not commercially introduced any product and our potential products are in varying early stages of development and testing.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S8	Our ability to attain profitability will depend upon our ability to develop products that are effective and commercially viable, to obtain regulatory approval for the manufacture and sale of our products and to license or otherwise market our products successfully.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S9	We may never achieve profitability, and even if we do, we may not be able to sustain being profitable.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S10	We depend heavily on our executive officers, directors, and principal consultants and the loss of their services would materially harm our business.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S11	We believe that our success depends, and will likely continue to depend, upon our ability to retain the services of our current executive officers, directors, principal consultants and others.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S12	The loss of the services of any of these individuals would have a material adverse effect on our business.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S13	In addition, we have established relationships with universities, hospitals and research institutions, which have historically provided, and continue to provide, us with access to research laboratories, clinical trials, facilities and patients.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S14	Additionally, we believe that we may, at any time and from time to time, materially depend on the services of consultants and other unaffiliated third parties.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S15	We cannot assure you that consultants and other unaffiliated third parties will provide the level of service to us that we require in order to achieve our business objectives.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S16	Our industry is highly competitive, and our product candidates may become obsolete.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S17	We are engaged in a rapidly evolving field.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S18	Competition from other pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and research and academic institutions is intense and likely to increase.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S19	Many of those companies and institutions have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S20	Those companies and institutions also have substantially greater experience in developing products, in conducting clinical trials, in obtaining regulatory approval and in manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P13_S21	Our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for competitive products.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We are aware of at least one other company that currently has a clinical-stage VDA for use in an oncology indication.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Some of these competitive products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing the desired therapeutic effect than products being developed by us.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Our competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective and/or cost competitive than those we are developing, or that would render our product candidates less competitive or even obsolete.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P14_S4	In addition, one or more of our competitors may achieve product commercialization or patent protection earlier than we do, which could materially adversely affect us.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P14_S5	We have licensed in rights to ZYBRESTAT, OXi4503 and other programs from third parties.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P14_S6	If our license agreements terminate or expire, we may lose the licensed rights to our product candidates, including ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503, and we may not be able to continue to develop them or, if they are approved, market or commercialize them.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We depend on license agreements with third parties for certain intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates, including patent rights.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	University and Angiogene Pharmaceuticals Ltd. for other programs.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In general, our license agreements require us to make payments and satisfy performance obligations in order to keep these agreements in effect and retain our rights under them.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	These payment obligations can include upfront fees, maintenance fees, milestones, royalties, patent prosecution expenses, and other fees.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	These performance obligations typically include diligence obligations.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P16_S4	If we fail to pay, be diligent or otherwise perform as required under our license agreements, we could lose the rights under the patents and other intellectual property rights covered by the agreements.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P16_S5	While we are not currently aware of any dispute with any licensors under our material agreements with them, if disputes arise under any of our in-licenses, including our in-licenses from ASU, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Baylor University and Angiogene Pharmaceuticals Ltd., we could lose our rights under these agreements.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Any such disputes may or may not be resolvable on favorable terms, or at all.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Whether or not any disputes of this kind are favorably resolved, our management s time and attention and our other resources could be consumed by the need to attend to and seek to resolve these disputes and our business could be harmed by the emergence of such a dispute.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P16_S8	If we lose our rights under these agreements, we may not be able to conduct any further activities with the product candidate or program that the license covered.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P16_S9	If this were to happen, we might not be able to develop our product candidates further, or following regulatory approval, if any, we might be prohibited from marketing or commercializing them.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P16_S10	In particular, patents previously licensed to us might after termination be used to stop us from conducting these activities.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P16_S11	We depend extensively on our patents and proprietary technology, and we must protect those assets in order to preserve our business.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P16_S12	Although we expect to seek patent protection for any compounds we discover and/or for any specific use we discover for new or previously known compounds, any or all of them may not be subject to effective patent protection.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P16_S13	Further, the development of regimens for the administration of pharmaceuticals, which generally involve specifications for the frequency, timing and amount of dosages, has been, and we believe, may continue to be, important to our effort, although those processes, as such, may not be patentable.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P16_S14	In addition, the issued patents may be declared invalid or our competitors may find ways to avoid the claims in the patents.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P16_S15	Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, protect our trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	As of March 1, 2013, we were the exclusive licensee, sole assignee or co-assignee of twenty-nine (29) granted United States patents, ten (10) pending United States patent applications, one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty international patent application and granted patents and/or pending applications in several other major markets, including the European Union, Canada and Japan.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms like us are generally highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions, resulting in both an apparent inconsistency regarding the breadth of claims allowed in United States patents and general uncertainty as to their legal interpretation and enforceability.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Accordingly, patent applications assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not result in patents being issued, any issued patents assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not provide us with competitive protection or may be challenged by others, and the current or future granted patents of others may have an adverse effect on our ability to do business and achieve profitability.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Moreover, since some of the basic research relating to one or more of our patent applications and/or patents were performed at various universities and/or funded by grants, one or more universities, employees of such universities and/or grantors could assert that they have certain rights in such research and any resulting products.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Further, others may independently develop similar products, may duplicate our products, or may design around our patent rights.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P18_S4	In addition, as a result of the assertion of rights by a third party or otherwise, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of others in or outside of the United States.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Any licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights may not be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P18_S6	If we do not obtain such licenses, we could encounter delays in product market introductions while our attempts to design around such patents or could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is foreclosed.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P18_S7	In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against us or in connection with patents to which we hold licenses or in bringing suit to protect our own patents against infringement.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P18_S8	We require employees and the institutions that perform our preclinical and clinical trials to enter into confidentiality agreements with us.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	made known to the individual during the course of the relationship with us to be kept confidential and not to be disclosed to third parties, except in specific circumstances.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Any such agreement may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our products may result in product liability exposure, and it is uncertain whether our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all claims.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	The use of our product candidates in clinical trials and for commercial applications, if any, may expose us to liability claims, in the event such product candidates cause injury or disease, or result in adverse effects.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P19_S4	These claims could be made directly by health care institutions, contract laboratories, patients or others using such products.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Although we have obtained liability insurance coverage for our ongoing clinical trials, this coverage may not be in amounts sufficient to protect us from any product liability claims or product recalls which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Further, adverse product and similar liability claims could negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our technology and product candidates under development.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P19_S7	If we do not obtain required regulatory approvals, we will be unable to market and sell our product candidates.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P19_S8	Our product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to development, clinical trials, manufacturing, oversight of clinical investigators, recordkeeping and commercialization.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P19_S9	Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory review and approval process are required to be successfully completed in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new drug can be sold.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P19_S10	Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain, and subject to unanticipated delays.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P19_S11	The time required to obtain approval by the FDA is unpredictable but typically exceeds five years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the complexity of the product candidate.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P19_S12	We have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P19_S13	In connection with the clinical trials of our product candidates, we face risks that:
908259_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	the results may not meet the level of statistical significance or clinical benefit-to-risk ratio required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for marketing approval.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Only a small percentage of product candidates for which clinical trials are initiated are the subject of NDAs and even fewer receive approval for commercialization.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Furthermore, even if we do receive regulatory approval to market a product candidate, any such approval may be subject to limitations such as those on the indicated uses for which we may market the product.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	If clinical trials for our product candidates are prolonged, delayed or suspended, we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis, which would require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any revenue from potential product sales.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or any regulatory authority to delay or suspend those clinical trials or delay the analysis of data derived from them.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	completion of our other ongoing and planned clinical trials and negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and to market and sell, a particular product candidate:
908259_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	failure of our third-party contractors to comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise meet their contractual obligations to us.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed by the imposition of additional conditions on our clinical trials by the FDA or any foreign regulatory authority or the requirement of additional supportive studies by the FDA or any foreign regulatory authority.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In addition, clinical trials require sufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the conduct of other clinical trials that compete for the same patients as our clinical trials, and the eligibility criteria for our clinical trials.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Our failure to enroll patients in our clinical trials could delay the completion of the clinical trial beyond our expectations.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P22_S4	In addition, the FDA could require us to conduct clinical trials with a larger number of subjects than we have projected for any of our product candidates.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P22_S5	We may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in a timely or cost-effective manner.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Furthermore, enrolled patients may drop out of our clinical trials, which could impair the validity or statistical significance of the clinical trials.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P22_S7	We do not know whether our clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured, or will be completed on schedule, if at all.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P22_S8	Delays in our clinical trials will result in increased development costs for our product candidates, and our financial resources may be insufficient to fund any incremental costs.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P22_S9	In addition, if our clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be limited.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P22_S10	Our product candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory review even if they receive marketing approval, and if we fail to comply with continuing regulations, we could lose these approvals and the sale of any approved commercial products could be suspended.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P22_S11	Even if we receive regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, and record keeping related to the product will remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P22_S12	If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA and other applicable domestic and foreign regulatory authorities or previously unknown problems with any approved product, manufacturer, or manufacturing process is discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:
908259_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If physicians and patients do not accept our future products or if the market for indications for which any product candidate is approved is smaller than expected, we may be unable to generate significant revenue, if any.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Even if any of our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, and third-party payers.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Physicians may decide not to recommend our drugs for a variety of reasons including:
908259_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	ineffective marketing and distribution support of our products.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If any of our product candidates are approved, but fail to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenue and our business would suffer.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We have no manufacturing capacity and have relied on, and expect to continue to rely on, third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P24_S3	We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates or any of the compounds that we are testing in our preclinical programs, and we lack the resources and the capabilities to do so.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P24_S4	As a result, we currently rely, and we expect to rely in the future, on third-party manufacturers to supply our product candidates.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our product candidates or products ourselves, including:
908259_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	the possible termination or non-renewal of the agreement by the third party, based on our own business priorities, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If we do not maintain our developed important manufacturing relationships, we may fail to find replacement manufacturers or develop our own manufacturing capabilities, which could delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products and substantially increase our costs or deplete profit margins, if any.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If we do find replacement manufacturers, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us, and there could be a substantial delay before new facilities could be qualified and registered with the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require manufacturers to register manufacturing facilities.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The FDA and corresponding foreign regulators also inspect these facilities to confirm compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Contract manufacturers may face manufacturing or quality control problems causing drug substance production and shipment delays or a situation where the contractor may not be able to maintain compliance with the applicable cGMP requirements.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Any failure to comply with cGMP requirements or other FDA and comparable foreign regulatory requirements could adversely affect our clinical research activities and our ability to develop our product candidates and market our products after approval.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop our product candidates and commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely basis.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P26_S5	The uncertainty associated with pharmaceutical reimbursement and related matters may adversely affect our business.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Market acceptance and sales of any one or more of our product candidates that we develop will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will cover and establish payment levels.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We cannot be certain that reimbursement will be available for any product candidates that we develop.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Also, we cannot be certain that reimbursement policies will not reduce the demand for, or the price paid for, our products.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	If reimbursement is not available or is available on a limited basis, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidates that we develop.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The legislation established Medicare Part D, which expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drug purchases by the elderly but provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The United States and several foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P30_S3	We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any products that we develop due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, ACA, became law in the U.S.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The goal of ACA is to reduce the cost of health care and substantially change the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	While we cannot predict what impact on federal reimbursement policies this legislation will have in general or on our business specifically, the ACA may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of, and the price we may charge for, any products we develop that receive regulatory approval.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P31_S3	We also cannot predict the impact of ACA on us as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions, which has not yet occurred.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Our restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated by-laws, our stockholder rights agreement and Delaware law could deter a change of our management which could discourage or delay offers to acquire us.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	change in our management or the acquisition of control by a holder of a substantial amount of our voting stock.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish, or could deter, transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interests or the best interests of us.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Further, the rights issued under the stockholder rights agreement would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our Board of Directors.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P32_S3	The price of our common stock is volatile, and is likely to continue to fluctuate due to reasons beyond our control.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P32_S4	The market price of our common stock has been, and likely will continue to be, highly volatile.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Factors, including our financial results or our competitors financial results, clinical trial and research development announcements and government regulatory action affecting our potential products in both the United States and foreign countries, have had, and may continue to have, a significant effect on our results of operations and on the market price of our common stock.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P32_S6	We cannot assure you that your investment in our common stock will not fluctuate significantly.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P32_S7	One or more of these factors could significantly harm our business and cause a decline in the price of our common stock in the public market.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Substantially all of the shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants have been registered for resale or are available for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may be sold from time to time.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Such sales, as well as future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders, or the perception that sales may occur at any time, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The low trading volume of our common stock may adversely affect the price of our shares.
908259_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Although our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock has experienced low trading volume.

908259_13_ITEM4_P3_S0	Unregistered Sales of Securities On November 28, 2011, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement and a Registration Rights Agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, or LPC.
908259_13_ITEM4_P3_S1	Under the Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right to sell to LPC up to $20,000,000 of its common stock, subject to certain limitations, at the Company s option.
908259_13_ITEM4_P4_S0	Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company filed a registration statement and prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, covering shares that have been issued or may be issued to LPC under the Purchase Agreement.
908259_13_ITEM4_P4_S1	The registration statement was declared effective on January 11, 2012 and will be effective for up to 36 months from that date, or until January 11, 2015.
908259_13_ITEM4_P5_S0	The Company has the right, subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, to direct LPC to purchase up to $20,000,000 of its common stock, subject to certain limitations, in amounts up to $200,000 at one time, which amounts may be increased depending on the closing sale price of the Company s common stock, as often as every two business days under certain conditions.

908259_13_ITEM4_P5_S3	The Company may, at any time in its sole discretion, terminate the Purchase Agreement without fee, penalty or cost upon one business days notice.
908259_13_ITEM4_P5_S4	On November 28, 2011, the Company issued 24,975 shares of its common stock to LPC as an initial commitment fee upon entering into the Purchase Agreement.
908259_13_ITEM4_P5_S5	It may issue up to 49,950 shares as an additional commitment fee as LPC purchases up to $20,000,000 of the Company s common stock.
908259_13_ITEM4_P6_S0	The Company relied on the private placement exemption provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 for the issuance of the 24,975 shares of common stock to LPC.

908259_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	data with respect to the Company for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2012.
908259_13_ITEM6_P0_S1	The selected financial data for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2012 has been derived from the audited financial statements of the Company.
908259_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
908259_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or outcomes to be materially different from those anticipated and discussed herein.
908259_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	Important factors that we believe may cause such differences are discussed in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report and in the cautionary statements accompanying the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report.
908259_13_ITEM7_P0_S3	In assessing forward-looking statements contained herein, readers are urged to read carefully all Risk Factors and cautionary statements contained in this Annual Report.
908259_13_ITEM7_P0_S4	Further, we operate in an industry sector where securities prices are volatile and may be influenced by regulatory and other factors beyond our control.
908259_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are a clinical-stage, biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics primarily to treat cancer.
908259_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our primary focus is the development of product candidates referred to as vascular disrupting agents, or VDAs, that selectively disable and destroy abnormal blood vessels that provide solid tumors a means of growth and survival, and also are associated with visual impairment in a number of ophthalmological diseases and conditions.
908259_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	We have 3 product candidates in the development stage in three areas; ZYBRESTAT in oncology, OXi4503 in oncology and ZYBRESTAT in ophthalmology.
908259_13_ITEM7_P1_S3	Our primary focus has been our ZYBRESTAT in oncology program.
908259_13_ITEM7_P1_S4	Since the fall of 2011, we have focused our capital resources on our most promising early-stage clinical programs with the goal of reducing our cash utilization.
908259_13_ITEM7_P1_S5	Accordingly, our resources have been focused primarily on supporting our ovarian Phase 2 clinical trial which is being conducted by the Gynecological Oncology Group, or GOG, our acute myeloid leukemia, or AML Phase 1 clinical trial being conducted by the University of Florida, our distribution agreement with Azanta, preclinical programs and the manufacture of clinical supply of our product candidates to support our programs.
908259_13_ITEM7_P1_S6	We have also spent resources completing our ATC trial (FACT trial) and designing a Phase 3 registrational study in anaplastic thyroid cancer, or ATC (FACT 2 trial), and while we were successful in receiving a SPA with the FDA for the FACT 2 trial, we have subsequently determined that this trial is not financially feasible at this time with our limited financial resources.
908259_13_ITEM7_P1_S7	We are now focusing our efforts in this area on pursuing the commercialization of ZYBRESTAT in Europe for the treatment of ATC with a marketing authorization under exceptional or conditional circumstances.
908259_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	tumors, ovarian cancer and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.
908259_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	On February 2010, we announced a restructuring designed to focus our resources on our highest-value clinical assets and reduce our cash utilization.
908259_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	As a part of this restructuring we stopped enrollment of additional patients in the FACT trial and reduced our work force by approximately 49% (20 employees).
908259_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	We have concluded these clinical trials, which is the primary reason for the reduction in our expenses in 2012 and 2011 as compared to 2010.
908259_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	We are committed to a disciplined financial strategy and as such maintain a limited employee and facilities base, with development, scientific, finance and administrative functions, which include, among other things, product development, regulatory oversight and clinical testing.
908259_13_ITEM7_P3_S4	Our research and development team members typically work on a number of development projects concurrently.
908259_13_ITEM7_P3_S5	Accordingly, we do not separately track the costs for each of these research and development projects to enable separate disclosure of these costs on a project-by-project basis.
908259_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	We conduct scientific activities pursuant to collaborative arrangements with universities.
908259_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	Regulatory and clinical testing functions are generally contracted out to third-party, specialty organizations.
908259_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Financial Resources We have experienced net losses every year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2012, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $225,432,000.
908259_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	We expect to incur significant additional operating losses over at least the next several years, principally as a result of our continuing clinical trials and anticipated research and development expenditures.
908259_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	The principal source of our working capital to date has been the proceeds of private and public equity financings and to a significantly lesser extent the exercise of warrants and stock options.
908259_13_ITEM7_P5_S3	We currently have no recurring material amount of licensing or other income.
908259_13_ITEM7_P5_S4	As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately $4,966,000 in cash and restricted cash.
908259_13_ITEM7_P5_S5	Currently, we have two potential vehicles for raising capital as described in detail in Note 6 to the Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2012 and in Liquidity below.
908259_13_ITEM7_P5_S6	In summary, subject to a minimum purchase price of $6.00 per share and other conditions of the arrangement, we may sell up to a total of $20,000,000 of our common stock to Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, or LPC, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement, the LPC Purchase Agreement, The price of our common stock as of March 1, 2013 was $4.06 and therefore the facility is not available to us at this time.
908259_13_ITEM7_P5_S7	We also have entered into an at the market equity offering sales agreement, or the ATM Agreement, with MLV Co. LLC, or MLV, pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of common stock from time to time through MLV acting as our sales agent and underwriter.
908259_13_ITEM7_P5_S8	The Company is limited as to how many shares it can sell under the ATM Agreement due to limitations imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on the number of shares issuable pursuant to a Form S-3 registration statement in a primary offering by smaller reporting companies such as the Company.
908259_13_ITEM7_P5_S9	As of March 1, 2013 the total dollar amount of common stock that the Company could sell under the ATM agreement during the next twelve months is approximately $750,000 under its current registration statement.
908259_13_ITEM7_P5_S10	The Company may be able to sell more shares under this agreement over the next twelve months depending on several factors including the Company s stock price, number of shares outstanding and when the sales take place.
908259_13_ITEM7_P5_S11	Based on our limited ongoing programs and operations and the reductions in cash utilization resulting from our September 2011 reduction in work force, we expect our existing cash to support our operations through the middle of the fourth quarter of 2013.
908259_13_ITEM7_P5_S12	However, this level of cash utilization does not allow us to initiate any significant projects, including clinical trials, to further the development of our most advanced product candidates, primarily ZYBRESTAT.
908259_13_ITEM7_P5_S13	Any significant further development of ZYBRESTAT or other capital intensive activities will be contingent upon our ability to raise additional capital in addition to our existing financing arrangements, as to which we can give you no assurance.
908259_13_ITEM7_P5_S14	We will require significant additional funding to fund operations and to continue the development of our product candidates.
908259_13_ITEM7_P5_S15	Such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
908259_13_ITEM7_P5_S16	If we are unable to access additional funds when needed, we may not be able to continue the development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations.
908259_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	If we access funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own, on terms that are not favorable to us.
908259_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
908259_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
908259_13_ITEM7_P6_S4	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to intangible assets.
908259_13_ITEM7_P6_S5	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
908259_13_ITEM7_P6_S6	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
908259_13_ITEM7_P6_S7	While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements included in this report, we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.
908259_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	License Agreements On August 2, 1999, we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development, manufacture, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by Arizona State University.
908259_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	The carrying value is being amortized over the term of the license (approximately 15.5 years).
908259_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	Management is required to perform an impairment analysis of its long-lived assets if triggering events occur.
908259_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	We review for such triggering events, including triggering events such as a going concern opinion and continuing operating losses, periodically.
908259_13_ITEM7_P7_S4	In addition, the agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals, which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones as defined in the agreement.
908259_13_ITEM7_P7_S5	We expense these payments to research and development in the period that payment becomes both probable and estimable.
908259_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Share-based compensation We record the expense recognition of the estimated fair value of all share-based payments issued to employees.
908259_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	The valuation of employee stock options is an inherently subjective process, since market values are generally not available for long-term, non-transferable employee stock options.
908259_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	Accordingly, an option pricing model is utilized to derive an estimated fair value.
908259_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	In calculating the estimated fair value of our stock options, we used the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires certain input assumptions.
908259_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	We estimate the expected term of options based on an analysis of historical behavior of participants over time.
908259_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	We determine the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term.
908259_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	We are required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
908259_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	Accordingly, we perform a historical analysis of option awards that are forfeited prior to vesting, and record total stock option expense that reflects this estimated forfeiture rate.
908259_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	In December 2011, we established a distribution agreement with Azanta Danmark A/S, or Azanta, to provide access to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of patients with ATC on a compassionate use basis in certain specified territories.
908259_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	healthcare professionals in the specified territories to prescribe ZYBRESTAT to individual ATC patients while it is still in development.
908259_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	Our agreement with Azanta provides that upon the receipt of ZYBRESTAT by Azanta for distribution and sale to compassionate use patients, Azanta has 30 days to inspect the product for defects and to ensure that the product conforms to the warranties made by us.
908259_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	If Azanta does not notify us of any defective product within the 30-day period it will be deemed to have accepted the product.
908259_13_ITEM7_P13_S3	Revenue is recognized based on product accepted at the conclusion of the 30-day inspection period.
908259_13_ITEM7_P13_S4	Azanta will also pay to us, on a quarterly basis, an amount equal to 20% of Azanta s gross margin, as defined in the agreement, on its sales in the preceding quarter.
908259_13_ITEM7_P13_S5	This revenue will be recognized upon notification from Azanta of the gross margin earned.
908259_13_ITEM7_P13_S6	Currently, the Company s drug is expensed as manufactured, since it is still in development.
908259_13_ITEM7_P13_S7	As a result, the product provided to the Azanta has a zero cost basis, and therefore there is no cost-of-goods sold.
908259_13_ITEM7_P13_S8	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 Revenues We recognized approximately $156,000 in product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $0 in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
908259_13_ITEM7_P13_S9	Revenues in 2012 represent amounts recognized under our distribution agreement with Azanta which was established in December 2011.
908259_13_ITEM7_P13_S10	We recognized approximately $148,000 of product revenues in 2012, after delivery of our drug for compassionate use to Azanta and the 30 day inspection period had expired at which point the drug was deemed accepted.
908259_13_ITEM7_P13_S11	Additionally, we recognized approximately $8,000 as payment for 20% of Azanta s gross margin, as defined in the agreement, on its sales in the preceding quarter, in 2012, after Azanta notified us of the amount.
908259_13_ITEM7_P13_S12	In 2013, we expect approximately the same levels of revenue as 2012, although there can be no assurance of this and at this time, we have no future firm orders from Azanta.
908259_13_ITEM7_P13_S13	Our drug was expensed in the period it was manufactured, since it is in the development stage and does not have an alternative future use.
908259_13_ITEM7_P13_S14	As a result, the product provided to Azanta had a zero cost basis, and therefore there is no cost-of-goods sold.
908259_13_ITEM7_P13_S15	Our future revenues will depend upon our ability to establish collaborations with respect to, and generate revenues from, products currently under development by us.
908259_13_ITEM7_P13_S16	We expect that we will not generate meaningful revenue in the near term future, unless and until we enter into new collaborations providing for funding through the payment of licensing fees and up-front payments.
908259_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	on our most promising early-stage clinical programs.
908259_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	The clinical programs we have completed include trials in our ZYBRESTAT for oncology program, including those we conducted in anaplastic thyroid cancer and non-small cell lung cancer and to a lesser extent clinical trials in our OXi4503 program and our ZYBRESTAT for ophthalmology program.
908259_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	In 2012, these reductions in costs were offset in part by increased costs of supporting our ovarian clinical trial being conducted by the GOG and the cost of manufacturing clinical drug supplies.
908259_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	External services include clinical research organizations, clinical site services, labs, clinical manufacturing and many other outside services.
908259_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	The reduction in these expenses in the two years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 are due to the completion of the clinical trials as referenced above.
908259_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Employee compensation and related expenses include employee compensation, temporary help, employee benefits and travel.
908259_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	The reduction in employee compensation and related expenses for the two years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 is primarily due to the reduction of research and development programs as noted above and associated restructuring and reduction of staff for the decreased level of activity.
908259_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	Employee stock-based compensation expense decreased for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 due primarily to the reduction in headcount; this amount can also vary significantly from period to period due to the timing and vesting of option grants.
908259_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	Employee stock-based compensation expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 due primarily to the due to the timing and vesting of option grants.
908259_13_ITEM7_P16_S4	Other expenses include facility expenses and licensing fees and amortization.
908259_13_ITEM7_P16_S5	Other expenses have increased in the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended 2011, primarily due to a license fee we expensed in the 2012 fiscal year.
908259_13_ITEM7_P16_S6	The reduction in other expenses in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily due to a reduction in both our research and development facility related costs as well as program wide support costs for the comparable periods.
908259_13_ITEM7_P16_S7	We continue to evaluate next steps in the development of our clinical programs.
908259_13_ITEM7_P16_S8	As a result, research and development expenses in the future could vary significantly from those incurred in the 2012 fiscal year.
908259_13_ITEM7_P16_S9	We plan to begin new clinical trials in our oncology program, however, these studies are dependent upon receiving funding.
908259_13_ITEM7_P16_S10	If we should receive funding, then research and development expenses will increase.
908259_13_ITEM7_P16_S11	General and administrative expenses The table below summarizes the most significant components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated, in thousands, and the amount and percentage change in these components:
908259_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Employee compensation and related expenses decreased in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the fiscal year ended 2011 due primarily to a restructuring and reduction in headcount in September 2011.
908259_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2012, this cost reduction was slightly offset by additional costs in the first quarter of 2012 related to the transition of consolidating our Massachusetts administrative offices, including our finance employees, to our California headquarters.
908259_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	The reduction in employee compensation and related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended 2010 is due primarily to a reduction in our average full time equivalents for the comparable period.
908259_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Employee stock-based compensation expense decreased in fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 compared to the respective prior fiscal years, due in part to the reduction in headcount but can also vary significantly from period to period due to the timing and vesting of option grants.
908259_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	Consulting and professional services expenses increased in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 due primarily to administrative, legal and investor relations costs, in part due to our reverse stock split, and board fees which increased due to a revised Board compensation policy.
908259_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	The reduction in consulting and professional services expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended 2010 is primarily due to one-time costs incurred in 2010 in connection with certain transactions.
908259_13_ITEM7_P18_S3	In addition, we experienced lower board member compensation expense attributable to lower stock valuations during the first half of the 2011 period as a portion of fees to board members were paid in the form of non-cash stock awards.
908259_13_ITEM7_P18_S4	Also, we recognized lower legal, accounting and service provider expenses due to fewer significant transactions during the 2011 period.
908259_13_ITEM7_P18_S5	Other expenses decreased in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 2011 due primarily to a reduction in facility related costs, including insurance.
908259_13_ITEM7_P18_S6	Other expenses increased in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010 due primarily to an increase in Delaware franchise tax fees.
908259_13_ITEM7_P18_S7	We continue to evaluate general and administrative expense and look for ways to decrease such costs.
908259_13_ITEM7_P18_S8	If we receive funding, as discussed above, we may begin new clinical trials in which case general and administrative expenses could increase in support of research and development activities.
908259_13_ITEM7_P18_S9	As a result, general and administrative expenses in the future could vary significantly from those incurred in the 2012 fiscal year.
908259_13_ITEM7_P18_S10	Restructuring We recorded a restructuring charge of $1,226,000 in the year ended December 31, 2011 and recorded net adjustments to the charge of $15,000 in the year ended December 31, 2012.
908259_13_ITEM7_P18_S11	This charge was a result of a restructuring plan announced on September 1, 2011, which included a reduction in work force, and was designed to focus our capital resources on our most promising early-stage clinical programs and further reduce our cash utilization.
908259_13_ITEM7_P18_S12	The restructuring is complete and the expenses in 2012 are reflective of the reductions in expense as a result of the restructuring.
908259_13_ITEM7_P18_S13	Other Income and Expenses The table below summarizes the components of Other Income and Expense for the periods indicated, in thousands:
908259_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	We recorded an unrealized (non-cash) gain in the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 and an unrealized (non-cash) loss in the year ended December 31, 2010 as a result of the change in the estimated fair market value of our common stock warrants issued in connection with the offerings of our common stock.
908259_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	The Other income (expense) amounts are generally derived from net gains and losses on foreign currency exchange.
908259_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	Also included in the fiscal 2010 amount is our receipt of $733,000 in connection with qualified investments in a qualifying therapeutic discovery project under section 48D of the Internal Revenue Code in November 2010.
908259_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	The table below summarizes the components of the change in fair value of warrants for the periods indicated, in thousands:
908259_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Tax Matters At December 31, 2012, the Company had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $205,243,000 for U.S. income tax purposes, which begin to expire for U.S. purposes through 2020.
908259_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	Due to the degree of uncertainty related to the ultimate use of these loss carry-forwards, we have fully reserved this future benefit.
908259_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	Additionally, the future utilization of the U.S. net operating loss carry-forwards is subject to limitations under the change in stock ownership rules of the Internal Revenue Service.
908259_13_ITEM7_P22_S3	The valuation allowance decreased by approximately $195,000 and approximately $2,854,000 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
908259_13_ITEM7_P22_S4	For the year ended December 31,2012 the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in research and development credit carry-forwards offset in part by the increase in federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards.
908259_13_ITEM7_P22_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2011 the decrease was due primarily to the decrease in the net operating loss carry-forwards.
908259_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES To date, we have financed our operations principally through net proceeds received from private and public equity financings and through a strategic development arrangement with Symphony Capital Partners, L.P., which concluded in 2009.
908259_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	We have experienced negative cash flow from operations each year since our inception, except in fiscal 2000.
908259_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	As of December 31, 2012, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $225,432,000.
908259_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	We expect to continue to incur increased expenses, resulting in losses, over at least the next several years due to, among other factors, our continuing and planned clinical trials and anticipated research and development activities.
908259_13_ITEM7_P23_S4	We had cash and restricted cash of approximately $4,966,000 at December 31, 2012.
908259_13_ITEM7_P23_S5	The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated, in thousands:
908259_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	The net cash used in operating activities was $8,335,000 in the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $11,784,000 in the comparable period in 2011.
908259_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	The net cash used in both periods was primarily attributable to the net losses, adjusted to exclude certain non-cash items, primarily in the 2011 period from a change in the fair value of warrants and other financial instruments of $2,222,000.
908259_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	Net cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2012 period was also impacted by the pay down of our accrued restructuring costs and for both the 2012 and 2011 year end periods by the reduction of accrued liabilities offset in part by non-cash stock-based compensation.
908259_13_ITEM7_P24_S3	Net cash provided by financing activities was $3,317,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $17,154,000 in the comparable period in 2011.
908259_13_ITEM7_P24_S4	Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 was attributable to net proceeds from the sale of common stock pursuant to the LPC Purchase Agreement and the ATM Agreement described below.
908259_13_ITEM7_P24_S5	Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the sale of common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement discussed below.
908259_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	On January 18, 2011, we entered into separate Warrant Exchange Agreements with each of the holders of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock issued in March 2010, pursuant to which, at the initial closing, the warrant holders exchanged their outstanding Series A and Series C warrants having ratchet price-based anti-dilution protections for (A) an aggregate of 91,411 shares of common stock and (B) Series E Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 101,885 shares of common stock.
908259_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	The Series E Warrants were not exercisable for six months, had an exercise price of $55.20 per share (reflecting the market value of the shares of common stock as of the close of trading on January 18, 2011, prior to the entry into the Warrant Exchange Agreements), and did not contain any price-based anti-dilution protections.
908259_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	In addition, we agreed to seek shareholder approval to issue up to 38,128 additional shares of common stock to the warrant holders in a subsequent closing.
908259_13_ITEM7_P25_S3	Such shareholder approval was obtained on March 18, 2011, and the Series E Warrants issued at the initial closing were exchanged for the additional 38,128 shares of common stock.
908259_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	In November 2011, we entered into a purchase agreement, the LPC Purchase Agreement, for the sale, from time to time, of up to $20,000,000 of our common stock to Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, or LPC, a Chicago-based institutional investor.
908259_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	We do not have the ability to sell shares under this arrangement if we fail to maintain a minimum stock price of $6.00 or if we fail to maintain the effectiveness of a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
908259_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	The price of our common stock as of March 1, 2013 was $4.06 and therefore the facility is not available to us at this time.
908259_13_ITEM7_P26_S3	If our stock price rises above $6.00 and the other conditions of the arrangement are met, we could direct LPC to purchase up to $20,000,000 worth of shares of our common stock under our agreement over a 36-month period, in amounts of up to $200,000, which amounts may be increased under certain circumstances.
908259_13_ITEM7_P26_S4	During the 36-month term of the LPC Purchase Agreement, we control the timing and amount of any sales to LPC, if and when we decide, in accordance with the LPC Purchase Agreement.
908259_13_ITEM7_P26_S5	LPC has no right to require us to sell any shares to LPC, but LPC is obligated to make purchases as we direct, subject to certain conditions, which include the continuing effectiveness of a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering the resale of the shares that may be issued to LPC and limitations related to the market value of our common stock.
908259_13_ITEM7_P26_S6	There is no guarantee that funding from LPC will be available when needed, or at all.
908259_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	market prices of our shares immediately preceding the notice of sale to LPC without any fixed discount.
908259_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	The LPC Purchase Agreement may be terminated by us at any time, at our sole discretion, without any cost or penalty.
908259_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	We are unable to use this agreement at any time when the price to LPC of the shares of our common stock would be less than $6.00 per share.
908259_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	Assuming that the purchase price per share is $6.00 or greater, the total dollar amount of common stock that we could sell under the LPC Purchase Agreement during the next twelve months is approximately $17,400,000, provided that we would be required to file and have declared effective an additional registration statement in order to sell more than an additional 66,862 shares of our common stock under the LPC Purchase Agreement.
908259_13_ITEM7_P27_S4	In connection with the LPC Purchase Agreement, we issued 294,000 shares of common stock for proceeds of approximately $2,047,000, net of issuance costs, during the year ended December 31, 2012 including 6,493 shares issued as a commitment fee.
908259_13_ITEM7_P27_S5	Additionally, in connection with the LPC agreement, we issued approximately 25,000 shares of common stock as its initial commitment fee in November 2011.
908259_13_ITEM7_P27_S6	We issued no other shares under this agreement during the year ended December 31, 2011.
908259_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	On July 21, 2010, we entered into an at the market equity offering sales agreement, or ATM Agreement, with MLV Co. LLC, or MLV, pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through MLV who will act as our sales agent and underwriter.
908259_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	Sales of our common stock through MLV are made on the principal trading market of our common stock by means of ordinary brokers transactions at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by MLV and us.
908259_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	MLV uses its commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock from time to time, based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits we may impose).
908259_13_ITEM7_P28_S3	We pay MLV a commission rate of up to 7.0% of the gross sales price per share of any common stock sold through MLV as agent under the ATM Agreement.
908259_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company is limited as to how many shares it can sell pursuant to the ATM Agreement due to SEC limitations on the number of shares issuable pursuant to a Form S-3 registration statement in a primary offering by smaller reporting companies such as the Company.
908259_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	As of March 1, 2013 the total dollar amount of common stock that the Company could sell under the ATM Agreement during the next twelve months is approximately $750,000 under its current registration statement.
908259_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	The Company may be able to sell more shares over the next twelve months under this agreement depending on several factors, including the Company s stock price, number of shares outstanding and when the sales take place.
908259_13_ITEM7_P29_S3	In connection with the ATM Agreement, we issued 178,000 shares of common stock for proceeds of approximately $1,270,000 net of issuance costs, during the year ended December 31, 2012 and issued 650,000 shares of common stock for proceeds of approximately $17,146,000 during the year ended December 31, 2011.
908259_13_ITEM7_P29_S4	Additionally, the Company issued 304,000 shares of common stock under this agreement for gross proceeds of approximately $1,476,000, during the months of January and February of 2013.
908259_13_ITEM7_P29_S5	In December 2011, we established a distribution agreement with Azanta, which was expanded in August 2012, to provide access to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of patients in certain specified territories with ATC on a compassionate use basis.
908259_13_ITEM7_P29_S6	The Named Patient Program, to be managed by Azanta, provides a regulatory mechanism to allow healthcare professionals in the specified territories to prescribe ZYBRESTAT to individual ATC patients while it is still in development.
908259_13_ITEM7_P29_S7	Under the terms of the agreement, we will provide ZYBRESTAT to Azanta.
908259_13_ITEM7_P29_S8	Azanta will serve as exclusive distributor for ZYBRESTAT in the specified territories for this purpose and will provide ZYBRESTAT to physicians solely to treat ATC on a compassionate use basis in the specified territories until such time as ZYBRESTAT may obtain marketing approval in that territory.
908259_13_ITEM7_P29_S9	The specified territories include the European Union, including the Nordic countries and Switzerland, Canada, Israel and South Korea and the agreement may also be expanded to include other countries on a country-by-country basis.
908259_13_ITEM7_P29_S10	OXiGENE and Azanta will cooperate on regulatory activities relating to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of ATC within the territory.
908259_13_ITEM7_P29_S11	There will be no transfer of ownership of intellectual property rights for ZYBRESTAT to Azanta under the terms of the agreement.
908259_13_ITEM7_P29_S12	We do not expect to receive significant income from Azanta under this arrangement.
908259_13_ITEM7_P29_S13	In the year ended December 31, 2012 we received cash and recognized $156,000 of product revenue under this agreement.
908259_13_ITEM7_P29_S14	No revenue was recognized nor was any cash received under this agreement during 2011.
908259_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Based on our limited ongoing programs and operations and the reductions in cash utilization resulting from our September 2011 reduction in work force, we expect our existing cash to support our operations through the middle of the fourth quarter of 2013.
908259_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	However, this level of cash utilization does not allow for the initiation of any significant projects, including clinical trials, to further the development of our most advanced product candidates, primarily ZYBRESTAT.
908259_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	Any significant further development of ZYBRESTAT or other capital intensive activities will be contingent upon our ability to raise additional capital in addition to our existing financing arrangements.
908259_13_ITEM7_P30_S3	We will require significant additional funding to fund operations and to continue the development of our product candidates.
908259_13_ITEM7_P30_S4	Our ongoing capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including: the progress and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates under development, including ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503; the costs of complying with FDA and other regulatory agency requirements.
908259_13_ITEM7_P30_S5	For example, it was necessary for us to address findings set forth by the FDA in its correspondence to us in of March 2012.
908259_13_ITEM7_P30_S6	While we believe we have addressed these findings, we have no assurance that the FDA may not require more information or more changes in the future, which may be significant See Item 1A Risk Factors above regarding regulatory compliance and approvals; the progress of our research and development programs; the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals; the resources, if any, that we devote to develop manufacturing methods and advanced technologies; our ability to enter into licensing arrangements, including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs; the costs and expenses of filing, prosecuting and, if necessary, enforcing our patent claims, or defending against possible claims of infringement by third-party patent or other technology rights; the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, if any, undertaken by us; and, if and when approved, the demand for our products, which demand depends in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known, understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval, including the range of indications for which any product is granted approval.
908259_13_ITEM7_P30_S7	If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we will not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we will be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs or cease operations.
908259_13_ITEM7_P30_S8	We may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements.
908259_13_ITEM7_P30_S9	Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	If we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish, on terms that are not favorable to us, rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize.
908259_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	Our failure to raise capital when needed will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	The following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2012 in thousands:
908259_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Payments under clinical development and related commitments are based on the completion of activities as specified in the contract.
908259_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	The amounts in the table above assume the successful completion, by the third-party contractor, of all of the activities contemplated in the agreements.
908259_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Our primary drug development programs are based on a series of natural products called Combretastatins.
908259_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	services covered by certain patent rights owned by Arizona State University.
908259_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	This agreement was subsequently amended in June 2002.
908259_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	From the inception of the agreement through December 31, 2011, we have paid a total of $2,500,000 in connection with this license.
908259_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	The agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals, which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones, as defined in the agreement.
908259_13_ITEM7_P34_S4	The license agreement also provides for additional payments upon our election to develop certain additional compounds, as defined in the agreement.
908259_13_ITEM7_P34_S5	Future milestone payments under this agreement could total $200,000.
908259_13_ITEM7_P34_S6	We are also required to pay royalties on future net sales of products associated with these patent rights.
908259_13_ITEM7_P34_S7	We also have an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, for the commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including among others, ZYBRESTAT.
908259_13_ITEM7_P34_S8	Under the BMS license, we have the right to grant sublicenses.
908259_13_ITEM7_P34_S9	Under the license agreement, BMS is entitled to low-single-digit royalty payments for all commercial sales plus any remuneration OXiGENE receives for sale of ZYBRESTAT under named patient or compassionate use programs.
908259_13_ITEM7_P34_S10	All licensing fees and milestone payments under the license agreement, in the aggregate amount of $1,080,000, have been paid.
908259_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	We bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the BMS license and have a right, but not a duty, of enforcing patents covered by the license.
908259_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	Either party may terminate the license upon material default of the other party.
908259_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	At December 31, 2012, we did not hold any derivative financial instruments, commodity-based instruments or other long-term debt obligations.
908259_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We have accounted for certain outstanding warrants issued in connection with our prior equity offerings as liabilities as of December 31, 2012.
908259_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We have adopted an Investment Policy, the primary objectives of which are to preserve principal, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields while preserving principal.
908259_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Although our investments are subject to credit risk, we follow procedures to limit the amount of credit exposure in any single issue, issuer or type of investment.
908259_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase.
908259_13_ITEM7A_P1_S3	However, due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration, we believe that interest rate risk is mitigated.
908259_13_ITEM7A_P1_S4	Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in U.S. dollar accounts.
908259_13_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Although we may from time to time manufacture drugs and conduct trials and studies outside of the United States, we believe our exposure to foreign currency risk to be limited as the arrangements are typically in jurisdictions with relatively stable currencies.
908259_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and report on the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
908259_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	we file or submit under the Exchange Act, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
908259_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, identified in connection with the evaluation of such control that occurred during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
908259_13_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
908259_13_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
908259_13_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012.
908259_13_ITEM9A_P1_S5	This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
908259_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC.
908259_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud.
908259_13_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time.
908259_13_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.
908259_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Because we are not an accelerated filer, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, Ernst Young LLP was not required to issue an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting and, therefore, did not perform for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 an audit of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.

908259_13_ITEM15_P44_S0	Form 10-K Item 15(a)(1) OXiGENE, Inc.
908259_13_ITEM15_P45_S0	The following financial statements of OXiGENE, Inc. are included in Item 8:
908259_13_ITEM15_P46_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of OXiGENE, Inc.
908259_13_ITEM15_P46_S1	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of OXiGENE, Inc. as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related statements of comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012.
908259_13_ITEM15_P46_S2	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
908259_13_ITEM15_P46_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
908259_13_ITEM15_P46_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
908259_13_ITEM15_P46_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
908259_13_ITEM15_P46_S6	We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
908259_13_ITEM15_P46_S7	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
908259_13_ITEM15_P46_S8	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
908259_13_ITEM15_P47_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
908259_13_ITEM15_P47_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
908259_13_ITEM15_P47_S2	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of OXiGENE, Inc. at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
908259_13_ITEM15_P47_S3	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that OXiGENE, Inc. will continue as a going concern.
908259_13_ITEM15_P47_S4	As more fully described in Note 1, the Company has incurred operating losses since inception and expects to continue to incur operating losses over the next several years.
908259_13_ITEM15_P47_S5	These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
908259_13_ITEM15_P47_S6	Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1.
908259_13_ITEM15_P48_S0	The 2012 financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
908259_13_ITEM15_P49_S0	OXiGENE, INC. Notes to Financial Statements December 31, 2012 1.
908259_13_ITEM15_P49_S1	Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business OXiGENE, Inc. (the Company ), is incorporated in the state of Delaware, and is a clinical-stage, biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics primarily to treat cancer.
908259_13_ITEM15_P49_S2	The Company s major focus is developing vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) that selectively disrupt abnormal blood vessels associated with solid tumor progression.
908259_13_ITEM15_P49_S3	The Company is dedicated to leveraging its intellectual property and therapeutic development expertise to bring life-extending and life-enhancing medicines to patients.
908259_13_ITEM15_P49_S4	The Company has two VDA drug candidates currently being tested in clinical trials, ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503.
908259_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	Capital Resources In December 2012, the Company s board of directors voted unanimously to implement a 1:12 reverse stock split of the Company s common stock, following authorization of the reverse split by a shareholder vote on December 21, 2012.
908259_13_ITEM15_P50_S1	The reverse split became effective on December 28, 2013.
908259_13_ITEM15_P50_S2	All of the share and per share amounts discussed and shown in the financial statements and notes have been adjusted to reflect the effect of this reverse split.
908259_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	In February 2011, the Company s board of directors voted unanimously to implement a 1:20 reverse stock split of the Company s common stock, following authorization of the reverse split by a shareholder vote on December 21, 2010.
908259_13_ITEM15_P51_S1	The reverse split became effective on February 22, 2011.
908259_13_ITEM15_P51_S2	All of the share and per share amounts discussed and shown in the financial statements and notes have been adjusted to reflect the effect of this reverse split.
908259_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Company has experienced net losses every year since inception and, as of December 31, 2012, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $225,432,000.
908259_13_ITEM15_P52_S1	The Company expects to incur significant additional operating losses over at least the next several years, principally as a result of the Company s continuing clinical trials and anticipated research and development expenditures.
908259_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	The principal source of the Company s working capital to date has been the proceeds of private and public equity financings and to a lesser extent the exercise of warrants and stock options.
908259_13_ITEM15_P53_S1	The Company currently has no recurring material amount of licensing or other income.
908259_13_ITEM15_P53_S2	As of December 31, 2012, the Company had approximately $4,966,000 in cash and restricted cash.
908259_13_ITEM15_P53_S3	Based on the Company s limited ongoing programs and operations and taking into consideration the expected reductions in cash utilization resulting from the Company s September 2011 reduction in force, the Company expects its existing cash and cash equivalents to support its operations through the middle of the fourth quarter of 2013.
908259_13_ITEM15_P53_S4	However, this level of cash utilization does not provide for the initiation of any projects to further the development of the Company s most advanced product candidates, primarily ZYBRESTAT .
908259_13_ITEM15_P53_S5	Any significant further development of ZYBRESTAT or other capital intensive activities will be contingent upon the Company s ability to raise additional capital in addition to the existing financing arrangements.
908259_13_ITEM15_P53_S6	Additional funding may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms, or at all.
908259_13_ITEM15_P53_S7	If the Company is unable to access additional funds when needed, it may not be able to continue the development of its product candidates or the Company could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of its development programs and other operations.
908259_13_ITEM15_P53_S8	Any additional equity financing, if available to the Company, may not be available on favorable terms, most likely will be dilutive to its current stockholders and debt financing, if available, and may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_13_ITEM15_P53_S9	If the Company accesses funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, it may be required to relinquish rights to some of its technologies or product candidates that it would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on its own, on terms that are not favorable to the Company.
908259_13_ITEM15_P53_S10	The Company s ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, will materially harm its business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_13_ITEM15_P54_S0	Market, and trade in the over-the-counter market.
908259_13_ITEM15_P54_S1	These uncertainties create substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
908259_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Report of Independent Registered Accounting Firm at the beginning of the Financial Statements section of this Form 10-K includes a going concern explanatory paragraph.
908259_13_ITEM15_P55_S1	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
908259_13_ITEM15_P56_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
908259_13_ITEM15_P56_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
908259_13_ITEM15_P57_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk The Company has no significant off balance sheet concentrations of credit risk.
908259_13_ITEM15_P57_S1	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents.
908259_13_ITEM15_P57_S2	The Company holds its cash and cash equivalents at one financial institution.
908259_13_ITEM15_P58_S0	Cash and Restricted Cash The Company has $20,000 of restricted cash as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 that is used to secure financing through a Company credit card.
908259_13_ITEM15_P58_S1	This amount is classified apart from cash on the Balance Sheets.
908259_13_ITEM15_P59_S0	Fair Value The Company is required to disclose information on all assets and liabilities reported at fair value that enables an assessment of the inputs used in determining the reported fair values.
908259_13_ITEM15_P59_S1	Fair value hierarchy is now established that prioritizes valuation inputs based on the observable nature of those inputs.
908259_13_ITEM15_P59_S2	The fair value hierarchy applies only to the valuation inputs used in determining the reported fair value of the Company s investments and is not a measure of the investment credit quality.
908259_13_ITEM15_P59_S3	The hierarchy defines three levels of valuation inputs:
908259_13_ITEM15_P60_S0	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company did not hold any assets or liabilities subject to these standards, except the derivative liabilities and other financial instruments discussed below in Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to and Potentially Settled in the Company s Common stock which are valued using level 3 inputs.
908259_13_ITEM15_P61_S0	Furniture and Fixtures, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements Furniture and fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost.
908259_13_ITEM15_P61_S1	Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years, or the applicable lease term.
908259_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	License Agreements The carrying value of the license agreement with Arizona State University (ASU) is being amortized over the term of the agreement, which is approximately 15.5 years (see Note 3).
908259_13_ITEM15_P62_S1	The technology licensed from ASU is related to the Company s ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503 programs.
908259_13_ITEM15_P63_S0	The Company is required to perform an impairment analysis of its long-lived assets if triggering events occur.
908259_13_ITEM15_P63_S1	The Company reviews for such triggering events, such as a going concern opinion and continuing losses, periodically.
908259_13_ITEM15_P63_S2	Both the ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503 programs utilize intellectual property under the license agreement, demonstrating alternative future use in other research and development projects.
908259_13_ITEM15_P63_S3	The Company determined that there are no indicators of impairment of the asset as of December 31, 2012.
908259_13_ITEM15_P64_S0	The license agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals, which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones as defined in the agreement.
908259_13_ITEM15_P64_S1	The Company expenses these payments to research and development in the period the obligation becomes both probable and estimable.
908259_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	Accrued Research and Development The Company charges all research and development expenses, both internal and external costs, to operations as incurred.
908259_13_ITEM15_P65_S1	The Company s research and development costs represent expenses incurred from the engagement of outside professional service organizations, product manufacturers and consultants associated with the development of the Company s potential product candidates.
908259_13_ITEM15_P65_S2	The Company recognizes expenses associated with these arrangements based on the completion of activities as specified in the applicable contracts.
908259_13_ITEM15_P65_S3	Costs incurred under fixed-fee contracts are expensed ratably over the contract period absent any knowledge that the services will be performed other than ratably.
908259_13_ITEM15_P65_S4	Costs incurred under contracts with clinical trial sites and principal investigators are generally accrued on a patient-treated basis consistent with the terms outlined in the contract.
908259_13_ITEM15_P65_S5	In determining costs incurred on some of these programs, the Company takes into consideration a number of factors, including estimates and input provided by internal program managers.
908259_13_ITEM15_P65_S6	Upon termination of such contracts, the Company is normally only liable for costs incurred and committed to date.
908259_13_ITEM15_P65_S7	As a result, accrued research and development expenses represent the Company s reasonably estimated contractual liability to outside service providers at any particular point in time.
908259_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to and Potentially Settled in the Company s Common stock The Company evaluates all derivative financial instruments issued in connection with its equity offerings when determining the proper accounting treatment for such instruments in the Company s financial statements.
908259_13_ITEM15_P66_S1	The Company considers a number of generally accepted accounting principles to determine such treatment.
908259_13_ITEM15_P66_S2	The Company performs a number of steps to evaluate the features of the instrument against the guidance provided in the accounting pronouncements in order to determine the appropriate accounting treatment.
908259_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	The Company s policy with regard to settling outstanding financial instruments is to settle those with the earliest maturity date first which essentially sets the order of preference for settling the awards.
908259_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	In the majority of circumstances, the Company utilizes the Black Scholes method to determine the fair value of its derivative financial instruments.
908259_13_ITEM15_P68_S1	In some cases, where appropriate, the Company utilizes the Binomial method to determine the fair value of such derivative financial instruments.
908259_13_ITEM15_P68_S2	Key valuation factors in determining the fair value include the current stock price as of the date of measurement, the exercise price, the remaining contractual life, expected volatility for the instrument and the risk-free interest rate.
908259_13_ITEM15_P69_S0	Changes in fair value are recorded as a gain or loss in the Company s Statements of Comprehensive Loss with the corresponding amount recorded as an adjustment to liabilities on its Balance Sheet.

908259_13_ITEM15_P99_S1	The table below summarizes the factors used to determine the value of the Series A and C warrants outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2011.
908259_13_ITEM15_P100_S0	The Company established the fair value of the Series A and C warrants using the Black-Scholes option valuation model:
908259_13_ITEM15_P101_S0	Management determined the fair value of the Series E Warrants on the date of the initial closing to be $1,555,000.
908259_13_ITEM15_P101_S1	This fair value was estimated based upon the $48.00 per share fair value of the 38,128 shares of common stock expected to be exchanged for the Series E Warrants upon shareholder approval adjusted for a 15% discount for lack of marketability which existed until the expected shareholder vote.
908259_13_ITEM15_P101_S2	Management determined the fair value of the Series E warrants on the date of the subsequent closing to be $993,000.
908259_13_ITEM15_P101_S3	This fair value was estimated based upon the $26.04 per share fair value of the 38,128 shares of common stock exchanged for the Series E Warrants.
908259_13_ITEM15_P102_S0	Direct Registration Warrants On July 20, 2009, the Company raised approximately $10,000,000 in gross proceeds, before deducting placement agents fees and other offering expenses, in a registered direct offering (the Offering ) relating to the sale of 26,041 units, each unit consisting of (i) one share of common stock, (ii) a five-year warrant ( Direct Registration Series I ) to purchase 0.45 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $504.00 per share of common stock and (iii) a short-term warrant ( Direct Registration Series II ) to purchase 0.45 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $384.00 per share of common stock (the Units ).
908259_13_ITEM15_P102_S1	The short-term warrants expired on September 24, 2010 consistent with the terms of the warrant, without being exercised.
908259_13_ITEM15_P103_S0	The Company determined that the Direct Registration Series I warrants should be classified as a liability as they require delivery of registered shares of common stock and thus could require net-cash settlement in certain circumstances.
908259_13_ITEM15_P103_S1	Accordingly, these warrants were recorded as a liability at their fair value as of the date of their issuance and are revalued at each subsequent reporting date.
908259_13_ITEM15_P104_S0	The fair value of the direct registration warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation model applying the following assumptions:
908259_13_ITEM15_P105_S0	Committed Equity Financing Facility ( CEFF ) with Kingsbridge Capital Limited In February 2008, the Company entered into a Committed Equity Financing Facility ( CEFF ) with Kingsbridge Capital Limited ( Kingsbridge ), which was subsequently amended in February 2010 to increase the commitment period, increase the draw down discount price and increase the maximum draw period.

908259_13_ITEM15_P105_S4	In connection with the CEFF, the Company issued a warrant to Kingsbridge to purchase 1,041 shares of its common stock at a price of $657.60 per share exercisable beginning six months after February 19, 2008 and for a period of five years thereafter.
908259_13_ITEM15_P105_S5	The CEFF was terminated during 2011.
908259_13_ITEM15_P105_S6	As a result, shares of the Company s common stock are no longer available for sale under this facility.
908259_13_ITEM15_P106_S0	Due to the initially indeterminate number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants issued in connection with the Company s private placement on March 11, 2010, the Company concluded that the CEFF warrants should be recorded as a liability effective with the date of the private placement.
908259_13_ITEM15_P106_S1	The fair value of the warrants on this date was reclassified from equity to derivative liabilities.
908259_13_ITEM15_P106_S2	Changes in the fair market value from the date of the private placement to the reporting date were recorded as a gain or loss in Change in fair value of warrants in the Statements of Comprehensive Loss.
908259_13_ITEM15_P107_S0	Effective with the warrant exchange agreements executed in January 2011 as described above, the number of shares underlying the warrants issued in connection with the Company s private placement was no longer indeterminable, and the CEFF warrants were reclassified to equity.
908259_13_ITEM15_P107_S1	The Company revalued these warrants on the effective date of the exchange and recorded the gain in the Statements of Comprehensive Loss.
908259_13_ITEM15_P107_S2	The Company established the fair value of the CEFF warrants using the Black-Scholes option valuation model as reflected in the table below:
908259_13_ITEM15_P108_S0	Options The Company s 2005 Stock Plan, as amended at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in May 2012 (the 2005 Plan ) provides for the award of options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights to acquire up to 333,333 shares of the Company s common stock in the aggregate.
908259_13_ITEM15_P108_S1	Currently, the 2005 Plan allows for awards of up to 16,666 shares that may be granted to any one participant in any fiscal year.
908259_13_ITEM15_P108_S2	For options subject to graded vesting, the Company elected the straight-line method of expensing these awards over the service period.
908259_13_ITEM15_P108_S3	The following is a summary of the Company s stock option activity under its 2005 Plan for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012:
908259_13_ITEM15_P109_S0	As of December 31, 2012 there was approximately $256,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards that is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of approximately 2 years.
908259_13_ITEM15_P110_S0	The fair values for the stock options granted were estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for the three years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010:
908259_13_ITEM15_P111_S0	In calculating the estimated fair value of its stock options, the Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires the consideration of the following six variables for purposes of estimating fair value:
908259_13_ITEM15_P112_S0	the risk free interest rate for the expected option term.
908259_13_ITEM15_P112_S1	The closing market price of its common stock on the date of grant.
908259_13_ITEM15_P113_S0	The expected term of options represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on an analysis of historical behavior of participants over time.
908259_13_ITEM15_P113_S1	The expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Company s stock price is expected to fluctuate during the term of the option granted.
908259_13_ITEM15_P113_S2	The Company determines the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of its common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term.
908259_13_ITEM15_P113_S3	Expected Dividends Because the Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on any of its common stock and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future, the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option.
908259_13_ITEM15_P114_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury issues with a remaining life consistent with the option s expected term on the date of grant.
908259_13_ITEM15_P114_S1	The Company is required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
908259_13_ITEM15_P114_S2	This requirement applies to all awards that are not yet vested, including awards granted prior to January 1, 2006.
908259_13_ITEM15_P114_S3	Accordingly, the Company performed a historical analysis of option awards that were forfeited prior to vesting, and ultimately recorded total stock option expense that reflected this estimated forfeiture rate.
908259_13_ITEM15_P114_S4	Non-Vested Restricted Stock As of December 31, 2012, the Company did not have any non-vested restricted common stock outstanding.
908259_13_ITEM15_P114_S5	No restricted common stock were issued during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 or 2010.
908259_13_ITEM15_P115_S0	The Company recorded expense of approximately $0, $20,000 and $82,000 related to outstanding restricted stock awards during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
908259_13_ITEM15_P115_S1	The restricted stock awards were valued based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on their respective grant dates.
908259_13_ITEM15_P115_S2	Compensation expense was recognized on a straight line basis over the 4 year vesting period of the awards.
908259_13_ITEM15_P116_S0	The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which was suspended in 2012.
908259_13_ITEM15_P116_S1	Under the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 2009 ESPP ), employees have the option to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at 85% of the closing price on the first day of each purchase period or the last day of each purchase period (as defined in the 2009 ESPP), whichever is lower, up to specified limits.
908259_13_ITEM15_P116_S2	Eligible employees are given the option to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, on a tax-favored basis, through regular payroll deductions in compliance with Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
908259_13_ITEM15_P116_S3	Currently, an aggregate of 10,417 shares of common stock may be issued under the 2009 ESPP, subject to adjustment each year pursuant to the terms of the 2009 ESPP.
908259_13_ITEM15_P116_S4	The Company recorded expense relating to the 2009 ESPP for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 of approximately $0, $2,000, and $8,000, respectively.
908259_13_ITEM15_P117_S0	Pursuant to the 2009 ESPP provisions, each year beginning in 2010 there will be an annual increase in the number of shares available for issuance under the ESPP on the first day of the new year in an amount equal to the lesser of: 2,083 shares or 5% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on the last day of the preceding fiscal year.
908259_13_ITEM15_P118_S0	Basic and diluted net loss per share was calculated by dividing the net loss per share attributed to the Company s common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
908259_13_ITEM15_P118_S1	Diluted net loss per share includes the effect of all dilutive, potentially issuable common equivalent shares as defined using the treasury stock method.
908259_13_ITEM15_P118_S2	All of the Company s common stock equivalents are anti-dilutive due to the Company s net loss position for all periods presented.
908259_13_ITEM15_P118_S3	Accordingly, common stock equivalents of approximately 143,000, 83,000, and 27,000 stock options and 13,000, 13,000 and 243,000 warrants at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares for diluted net loss per share.

908259_13_ITEM15_P119_S0	After consideration of the available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company has determined that a full valuation allowance at December 31, 2012 and 2011, is necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.

908259_13_ITEM15_P119_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2012 this was due primarily to a decrease in research and development credit carry-forwards offset in part by the increase in federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards.

908259_13_ITEM15_P120_S0	The future utilization of the net operating loss carry-forwards and credit carry-forwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership changes that could have occurred in the past or that may occur in the future under the provisions of IRC Section 382 or 383 of the internal revenue code.
908259_13_ITEM15_P121_S0	In 2010, the Company received $733,000 in tax credit grants under the U.S. Government s Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Project for qualified research and development expenses.

908259_13_ITEM15_P124_S0	The implementation of ASC 740 did not have a material impact on the Company s financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

908259_13_ITEM15_P126_S1	There are currently no federal or state audits in progress, tax years still subject to examination for Federal and the State of Massachusetts and California authorities include all prior years due to the existence of net operating loss carry-forwards.

908259_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	Business Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development of vascular disrupting agents, or VDAs, for the treatment of cancer.
908259_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	We are pursuing what we believe to be a cost-efficient, risk-mitigated development strategy.
908259_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	In the United States, we are pursuing collaborations with established pharmaceutical companies with products whose efficacy we believe can be enhanced by the addition of our lead product candidate, ZYBRESTAT , and with non-profit research organizations such as the Gynecologic Oncology Group, or GOG, an organization dedicated to clinical research in the field of gynecologic cancer, for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer.
908259_14_ITEM1_P0_S3	In the European Union, we are primarily focused on pursuing registration for ZYBRESTAT for anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), a rare and highly aggressive cancer, through the European Union s exceptional circumstances marketing authorization process.
908259_14_ITEM1_P0_S4	To date, we have observed ZYBRESTAT to be well tolerated in over 400 patients and to have clinical activity in a variety of indications including ovarian cancer and ATC.
908259_14_ITEM1_P0_S5	We have been granted orphan drug designation for ovarian cancer and ATC in the United States and the European Union.
908259_14_ITEM1_P0_S6	Based on positive preclinical data, we are also pursuing the clinical development of ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), which are tumors that arise from the body s hormonal and nervous systems, produce excessive amounts of biologically active substances, and may cause debilitating symptoms.
908259_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	ZYBRESTAT Development Program Our lead compound, ZYBRESTAT , is a reversible tubulin binding agent that selectively targets the endothelial cells that make up the blood vessel walls in most solid tumors and causes them to swell, obstructing the flow of blood and starving the tumor of vital nutrients including oxygen.
908259_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	This deprivation, also known as tumor hypoxia, results in rapid downstream tumor cell death.
908259_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	Ovarian Cancer Ovarian cancer affects approximately 22,000 women in the U.S. each year.
908259_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	This form of cancer begins in the ovaries and often spreads to the rest of the pelvis and abdomen prior to detection, resulting in a relatively poor prognosis.
908259_14_ITEM1_P2_S2	In fact, more than 60% of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer are in stage III or IV, making it difficult to treat and often fatal, with a five-year survival rate of 47% a rate which is largely unchanged since the 1990s.
908259_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	There are relatively few cancer therapies that have been approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer, including carboplatin and cisplatin, gemcitabine, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel and also in the European Union, bevacizumab.
908259_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	Many patients eventually become resistant to platinum-based therapies, and new agents are needed.
908259_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	Due to the unmet need in the treatment of ovarian cancer and the small size of the indication, we have been granted an orphan drug designation in both the U.S. and Europe for the use of ZYBRESTAT in the treatment of ovarian cancer.
908259_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	Genentech / Roche s AVASTIN (bevacizumab) is an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody that is currently FDA-approved for the treatment of a variety of solid tumor indications, but not including ovarian cancer.
908259_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	We believe that using ZYBRESTAT in combination with AVASTIN (bevacizumab) may provide a clinically active yet potentially better tolerated alternative to the current standard of care, cytotoxic chemotherapy, for relapsed ovarian cancer.
908259_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	The topline results indicated a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival, the primary endpoint of the trial, with a p-value of less than 0.05.
908259_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	The trial enrolled 107 patients at 67 clinical sites in the United States and is being conducted by the GOG under the sponsorship of the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, or CTEP, of the National Cancer Institute, or NCI.
908259_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	Secondary endpoints in the study included safety, objective response rate (measured according to RECIST criteria) and overall survival.
908259_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	The topline results announced in March 2014 indicate that patients receiving the combination of ZYBRESTAT and AVASTIN (bevacizumab) achieved a higher objective response rate than patients receiving AVASTIN (bevacizumab) alone, but that increase was not statistically significant.
908259_14_ITEM1_P7_S3	In accordance with the study protocol, all patients will continue to be followed for overall survival.
908259_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	Consistent with prior clinical experience with ZYBRESTAT , patients in the combination arm experienced a higher incidence of hypertension compared to the control arm.
908259_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	All cases of hypertension were managed with antihypertensive treatments, as specified in the study protocol.
908259_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	Patients in both arms were treated until disease progression or adverse effects prohibited further therapy.
908259_14_ITEM1_P8_S3	We anticipate that additional data from the completed trial will be available in the second half of 2014 and that the full study results will be submitted for presentation at a future scientific meeting.
908259_14_ITEM1_P8_S4	We believe that this combination of vascular targeting agents, without the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy agents and their often significant side effects could provide a potentially better tolerated alternative for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer patients.
908259_14_ITEM1_P8_S5	In August 2012, we announced that a pre-specified interim safety analysis of 25 patients in this trial indicated that only one of these patients had suffered a protocol-specified serious adverse event in the trial to date, and therefore it was recommended that the trial continue to full enrollment.
908259_14_ITEM1_P8_S6	In February 2013, we announced the results of the second and final scheduled interim toxicity analysis based on the safety review of the first 53 evaluable patients who completed four months of therapy.
908259_14_ITEM1_P8_S7	The results were that there were no additional protocol-specified serious adverse events seen during this review, and that the study would continue to full enrollment.
908259_14_ITEM1_P8_S8	An interim futility analysis of this Phase 2 trial was performed in the second quarter of 2013.
908259_14_ITEM1_P8_S9	The original purpose of the analysis was to consider early study closure to limit patient exposure in the event that the experimental regimen was deemed futile (i.e., unlikely to be declared more effective than the reference regimen at the end of the study).
908259_14_ITEM1_P8_S10	Since the study had completed patient accrual, the analysis was conducted to review the tolerability of the combination.
908259_14_ITEM1_P8_S11	After the tolerability review, it was confirmed that the trial would continue to its pre-specified endpoint, which is based on progression-free survival.
908259_14_ITEM1_P8_S12	Importantly, this Phase 2 trial, also known as GOG0186I, was being supported by a variety of collaborators including Genentech / Roche, which manufactures and markets AVASTIN (bevacizumab), as well as the GOG, and its sponsor, the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the NCI.
908259_14_ITEM1_P8_S13	The trial was conducted under cooperative research and development agreements between us and NCI and between NCI and Genentech.
908259_14_ITEM1_P8_S14	As CTEP is bearing the majority of the clinical trial costs, our expenses related to this trial were primarily related to manufacturing sufficient quantities of ZYBRESTAT .
908259_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	Potential Development Pathway in Ovarian Cancer: ZYBRESTAT in combination with AVASTIN (bevacizumab)-Pivotal Trial In light of the top line results from the GOG186I trial which demonstrated a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival from the combination of bevacizumab plus ZYBRESTAT as compared to bevacizumab alone, we are currently evaluating the potential development pathway for ZYBRESTAT in ovarian cancer.
908259_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	Depending on the nature of the additional data from the GOG 186I trial, which we anticipate we will obtain in the second half of 2014, we may request an End-of-Phase-2 meeting with the FDA and the Scientific Advice Working Party of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to seek guidance on the design of one or more possible pivotal registration studies.
908259_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	Assuming a positive result from the meetings and availability of sufficient funding, we could initiate one or more pivotal registration trials in advanced relapsed ovarian cancer.
908259_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	ZYBRESTAT in combination with VOTRIENT (pazopanib) GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) s VOTRIENT (pazopanib) is an anti-angiogenic oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is currently FDA-approved for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and soft tissue sarcoma (STS), with compelling early clinical data in the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer.
908259_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	We believe that using ZYBRESTAT in combination with VOTRIENT (pazopanib) may provide a clinically active yet potentially better tolerated alternative to the current standard of care, cytotoxic chemotherapy, for relapsed ovarian cancer.
908259_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	We may collaborate with clinical investigators from two U.K.-based non-profit research organizations, the Christie National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust and the Hillingdon Hospital NHS Trust and with GlaxoSmithKline in the implementation of this study.
908259_14_ITEM1_P10_S3	The study is designed as a Phase 1b/2 trial of pazopanib with and without ZYBRESTAT , in advanced recurrent ovarian cancer.
908259_14_ITEM1_P10_S4	The trial design consists of a Phase 1 dose escalation portion with the combination of VOTRIENT and ZYBRESTAT and a randomized Phase 2 portion comparing VOTRIENT alone versus VOTRIENT plus ZYBRESTAT in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer.
908259_14_ITEM1_P10_S5	The study may enroll approximately 120 patients at sites in the U.K.
908259_14_ITEM1_P10_S6	The primary endpoint of the trial would be progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary endpoints would include safety, overall survival (OS), objective response rate, and CA125 response rate.
908259_14_ITEM1_P10_S7	Subject to approval by U.K. health authorities, appropriate funding by NHS with limited support by GlaxoSmithKline and us, and ethics committee approvals, this trial could begin in the second half of 2014.
908259_14_ITEM1_P10_S8	As in the combination therapy trial of ZYBRESTAT with AVASTIN (bevacizumab), which is sponsored and substantially funded by the National Cancer Institute, we believe that the potential collaboration among us, the Christie National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, the Hillingdon Hospital NHS Trust, and GlaxoSmithKline, under the sponsorship and primary funding of our U.K. based collaborators, would help offset costs associated with this trial.
908259_14_ITEM1_P10_S9	We expect to incur the limited costs in supporting certain resources required by the NHS and the participating institutions during the duration of this trial and the costs of supplying drug for the trial.
908259_14_ITEM1_P10_S10	We also remain interested in a conducting a randomized, two-arm Phase 2 clinical trial, comparing weekly dosing of TAXOL (paclitaxel) with weekly TAXOL (paclitaxel) plus ZYBRESTAT in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer.
908259_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	TAXOL (paclitaxel) is a chemotherapy agent used to treat patients with a variety of solid tumors, including lung, ovarian, breast, head and neck cancers.
908259_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	We believe that using ZYBRESTAT in combination with weekly TAXOL (paclitaxel) may demonstrate how combination therapy with ZYBRESTAT could improve standard of care and improve patient outcomes in certain patients with advanced relapsed ovarian cancer.
908259_14_ITEM1_P11_S2	However, pursuit of this study is dependent upon strategic decisions regarding our future course in ovarian cancer, including planning for potential Phase 3 pivotal studies in combination with Avastin, as well as external support, availability of additional resources and overall corporate priorities.
908259_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	Background in Ovarian Cancer Clinical Trials On June 15, 2012, British clinical investigators published results from a Phase 1 study in solid tumors in the journal Clinical Cancer Research, using a combination of ZYBRESTAT with AVASTIN (bevacizumab), an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody, without cytotoxic chemotherapy.
908259_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	The investigators observed disease stabilization in 9 of 14 treated patients, and a partial response lasting over one year in one patient with ovarian cancer, based on CA125 tumor marker levels.
908259_14_ITEM1_P12_S2	The investigators also observed that functional imaging of the tumors at baseline and after cycle 1 showed longer profound vascular changes and blood-flow shutdown when AVASTIN (bevacizumab) was added to the ZYBRESTAT treatment regimen, demonstrating the complementary therapeutic effect of ZYBRESTAT and AVASTIN (bevacizumab) on the tumor vasculature and serving as the basis for our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of ZYBRESTAT in combination with AVASTIN (bevacizumab) in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer.
908259_14_ITEM1_P12_S3	Similarly encouraging results have been observed using ZYBRESTAT in combination with Paraplatin (carboplatin) and Taxol (paclitaxel) in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
908259_14_ITEM1_P12_S4	Final results from a Phase 2 study conducted by the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre in the United Kingdom were published in the January 2011 issue of Annals of Oncology.
908259_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	outcomes could be substantially improved by using ZYBRESTAT in combination with Paraplatin (carboplatin) and Taxol (paclitaxel) in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
908259_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer, or ATC Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare, but particularly aggressive form of thyroid cancer that is resistant to mainstream cancer therapies and that has a particularly grim prognosis, with a median survival from diagnosis of three to four months and a one-year survival rate of less than 10%.
908259_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	Due to an unmet need in the treatment of ATC and the small size of the indication, we have been granted an orphan drug designation by both the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the use of ZYBRESTAT in the treatment of ATC.
908259_14_ITEM1_P14_S2	Based on the results of a Phase 2/3 controlled study in 80 patients with ATC, called the FACT study, comparing standard chemotherapy with and without ZYBRESTAT , the FDA has provided guidance that we would need to conduct one or more large pivotal trials to obtain regulatory approval for ZYBRESTAT in ATC in the United States.
908259_14_ITEM1_P14_S3	We believe these trials would be prohibitively expensive for such a rare indication.
908259_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	The European Union has alternative pathways for potential approval of drugs that are designed to treat life-threatening, extremely rare, orphan diseases such as ATC, without the requirement for large randomized trials.
908259_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	These include the possibility of a special marketing approval, known as an MAA under exceptional circumstances, in the case of therapies that address urgent, unmet medical needs.
908259_14_ITEM1_P15_S2	We received feedback from the Scientific Advice Working Party, or SAWP, of the EMA, in July 2013, two reviewing countries in March 2013, and from two more countries in February 2014, on our plan to submit an MAA for ZYBRESTAT in ATC.
908259_14_ITEM1_P15_S3	We intend to address and incorporate this feedback into our potential MAA filing, and we believe that it may be possible that we could obtain an MAA for the use of ZYBRESTAT in the treatment of ATC with the existing clinical data that we have.
908259_14_ITEM1_P15_S4	If we are successful in obtaining an MAA for ZYBRESTAT in the treatment of ATC, we believe that this could lead to similar authorizations in other countries such as Japan, South Korea, China, or Canada (but not in the United States).
908259_14_ITEM1_P15_S5	The unmet medical need of ATC patients in Europe is further addressed by a compassionate use distribution agreement that we entered into in December 2011 with a Danish company, which currently provides access to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of patients with ATC on a compassionate use basis in the European Union, including the Nordic countries and Switzerland, Canada, Israel and South Korea.
908259_14_ITEM1_P15_S6	For additional details, please refer to Collaborative Research and Development Arrangements.
908259_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Background in ATC Phase 1 and 2 clinical data that we have gathered thus far suggests that ZYBRESTAT could significantly improve outcomes in patients with ATC.
908259_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	In a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of ZYBRESTAT in combination with Paraplatin (carboplatin) and Taxol (paclitaxel) in the treatment of ATC, also known as the FACT (Fosbretabulin in Anaplastic Cancer of the Thyroid) trial, conducted between July 2007 and February 2010 in 80 patients at 40 sites in 11 countries, we demonstrated a meaningful, although not statistically significant, improvement in overall survival (OS), the primary endpoint.
908259_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	More specifically, the FACT trial showed a median overall survival, or OS, time of 5.2 months for patients receiving both chemotherapy and ZYBRESTAT compared to 4.0 months for patients receiving chemotherapy alone, equating to a 28% reduction in the risk of death.
908259_14_ITEM1_P16_S3	Put differently, patients treated with both chemotherapy and ZYBRESTAT had a 48% and 26% likelihood of being alive at six months and one year, respectively, versus only 35% and 9% for patients treated with chemotherapy alone.
908259_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	As in prior studies, ZYBRESTAT appeared to be well tolerated.
908259_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	Results from the FACT trial were subsequently presented at the 2010 American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, meeting and at the 2010 European Society for Medical Oncology, or ESMO, meeting.
908259_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	The results were also published in peer- reviewed scientific journals, including, most recently, Thyroid.
908259_14_ITEM1_P17_S3	Due to the rarity of the disease and the fact that many of the patients screened for the study either did not meet the trial s inclusion criteria, progressed rapidly or died, we experienced significant difficulties meeting our original 18-month, 180-patient enrollment goal and instead chose to discontinue enrollment after enrolling 80 patients.
908259_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	Neuroendocrine Tumors with Carcinoid Syndrome Carcinoid syndrome occurs in a sub-population of patients with neuroendocrine tumors who display an array of symptoms, such as flushing, diarrhea and, less frequently, bronchoconstriction and heart failure.
908259_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	These symptoms occur secondary to gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors (GI-NETs) in approximately 5% of patients.
908259_14_ITEM1_P18_S2	These symptoms are caused by overproduction of biologically active substances such as serotonin and kallikrein, which are released directly into systemic circulation, bypassing hepatic degradation.
908259_14_ITEM1_P18_S3	While drug treatment with somatostatin analogues, such as Sandostatin , helps to control the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome, patients who are or become unresponsive to somatostatin have limited therapeutic options, and we believe that treatment with ZYBRESTAT , resulting in vascular shutdown and tumor necrosis, may improve outcomes for these patients.
908259_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	Approximately 14,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with carcinoid tumors each year.
908259_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	A preclinical study of ZYBRESTAT in a transgenic mouse model of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) was presented at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, Boston, MA, in a poster session on October 20, 2013.
908259_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	This placebo-controlled preclinical study was designed to evaluate the activity of systemic administration of ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of functional insulinomas in a transgenic mouse model of PNETs.
908259_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	PNETs are highly vascularized tumors which originate in the pancreas.
908259_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	Functional PNETs make hormones that can cause a cascade of disease symptoms, resulting in significant morbidity for the patient.
908259_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	An insulinoma is a PNET that causes the over-secretion of the hormone insulin.
908259_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	The animals in the treatment group received ZYBRESTAT three times per week for four weeks, and the animals in the control group received a placebo at the same schedule.
908259_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	After four weeks, tumor size, serum insulin levels and other efficacy parameters, including apoptosis (cell death), cell proliferation and effects on tumor vasculature, were assessed.
908259_14_ITEM1_P22_S3	Treatment with ZYBRESTAT in this animal model resulted in a significant and sustained decrease in circulating insulin of more than 90% over four weeks following a single dose of ZYBRESTAT and was accompanied by a significantly reduced tumor size of greater than 80% in the treated group compared to the placebo treated group.
908259_14_ITEM1_P22_S4	Treatment with ZYBRESTAT was shown to be well tolerated, with no obvious toxicity and was shown to disrupt tumor vasculature, induce apoptosis (cell death) and inhibit tumor cell proliferation.
908259_14_ITEM1_P22_S5	In 2012, we announced the establishment of an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement with Angiogene Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a U.K.-based drug development company that had previously been developing a competing VDA, for intellectual property covering the use of VDAs in treatment of symptoms related to carcinoid syndrome and other neuroendocrine tumors.
908259_14_ITEM1_P22_S6	We enhanced this intellectual property with data collected from various preclinical studies of ZYBRESTAT , some of which are ongoing.
908259_14_ITEM1_P22_S7	Based on the strength of the preclinical data, we are planning to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of ZYBRESTAT in patients with recurrent GI-NETs with elevated biomarkers in the second half of 2014.
908259_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	In addition to developing ZYBRESTAT as an intravenously administered therapy for a number of solid tumor indications, we believe that ZYBRESTAT may also be useful as a therapy for a variety of ophthalmological diseases and conditions such as wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy that are characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth within the eye that result in loss of vision, many of which are currently treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies.
908259_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	While this program is not an immediate priority, we are actively seeking one or more potential development and commercialization partners with expertise in ophthalmology that would allow us to leverage our existing assets and move forward.
908259_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	In addition to pursuing development of ZYBRESTAT , we are also pursuing the development of a second product candidate, OXi4503, a novel second-generation, dual-mechanism VDA, which not only has been shown to reduce tumor blood flow but which also forms an antiproliferative metabolite.
908259_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	We believe that this dual mechanism differentiates OXi4503 from other VDAs and may result in enhanced anti-tumor activity in certain tumor types as compared with other VDA drug candidates.
908259_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	Based on preclinical data, we believe that OXi4503 may be particularly active in hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, and leukemias of the myeloid lineage, all of which have relatively high levels of the enzymes that facilitate the conversion of OXi4503 into a chemical that directly kills tumor cells.
908259_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	Similar to ZYBRESTAT , OXi4503 has shown potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies of solid tumors and acute myelogenous leukemia, and in two clinical studies in advanced solid tumors and liver tumors, both as a single agent and in combination with other antiproliferative agents.
908259_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our current development program for OXi4503 is as follows: Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, or AML AML is a relatively rare cancer of the myeloid blood cells, with approximately 10,500 new cases each year in the United States and accounting for approximately 1.2% of cancer deaths.
908259_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	AML is characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that pollute bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells.
908259_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	Due to an unmet need in the treatment of AML and the small size of the indication, we have been granted orphan drug designation in the United States for the use of OXi4503 in the treatment of AML.
908259_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	OXi4503 has demonstrated potent activity against AML in animal models, and these results were published in the journal Blood in September 2010.
908259_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	Shortly thereafter, we entered into a clinical trial agreement with the University of Florida related to an investigator-sponsored Phase 1 study of OXi4503 in up to 36 patients with AML or myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, a disorder of the normal blood formation process, which trial was subsequently initiated in May 2011.
908259_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	As the University of Florida and a non-profit research organization, the Leukemia Lymphoma Society s Therapy Acceleration Program, are covering the majority of the costs of this trial, our ongoing expenses related to this trial are primarily related to manufacturing sufficient quantities of OXi4503.
908259_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	In December 2012, the investigators at the University of Florida presented compelling initial data from this Phase 1 study at the 2012 annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in Atlanta, Georgia, indicating that OXi4503 was active, generating responses in patients, and had a manageable safety profile.
908259_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	More specifically, results from five initial patients with refractory AML enrolled between May 2011 and August 2012 revealed an increase in plasma LDH and uric acid levels by at least two-fold within hours after OXi4503 infusions, suggesting leukemia cell destruction.
908259_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	Adverse events attributable to OXi4503 infusion included bone pain, fever, anemia and thrombocytopenia, as well as hypertension, the latter of which was readily manageable.
908259_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	Updated data from this trial was presented at the December 2013 annual meeting of ASH in New Orleans, Louisiana.
908259_14_ITEM1_P29_S2	Among the first 13 patients treated at the two lowest dose levels, two patients have shown stable disease, one patient had a partial remission and one patient achieved a complete bone marrow response.
908259_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	Side effects included increases in D-dimer, which is a substance in the blood that is released when a blood clot breaks up, bone pain, fever, chills and flu-like symptoms.
908259_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	Accordingly, OXi4503 appears to be well tolerated based on these results to date in patients with relapsed and refractory AML and MDS.
908259_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	Biological activity associated with OXi4503 includes temporary increases in D-dimer which may be related to anti-leukemic activity of the drug.
908259_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	It is estimated that an additional 12-15 patients will be required to establish a maximum tolerated dose.
908259_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	This open-label, dose-escalating study for the treatment of up to 36 patients will evaluate the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose and biologic activity of OXi4503 in these patients.
908259_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	New patients are continuing to be enrolled in this study.
908259_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	As of March 17, 2014, 15 patients have been enrolled into this study, and a maximum tolerated dose has not been observed.
908259_14_ITEM1_P32_S3	Based on results to date, an expansion of the study to a second clinical site is planned, with the goal of increasing the rate of enrollment in the trial.
908259_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	We are a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 1988 in the state of New York and reincorporated in 1992 in the state of Delaware, with our principal corporate office in the United States at 701 Gateway Boulevard, Suite 210, South San Francisco, California 94080 (telephone: (650) 635-7000, fax: (650) 635-7001).

908259_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	Information contained on our web site does not form a part of this Form 10-K. Vascular Disrupting Agents: Background According to Cancer Research UK, a non-profit cancer research organization in the United Kingdom, nearly 90% of all cancers are solid tumors that are dependent upon a continually evolving vascular supply for their growth and survival.
908259_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	Similarly, in the ophthalmology field, abnormal neovascularization characterizes a variety of ophthalmological diseases and conditions, including wet age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, and diabetic retinopathy.
908259_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	Since 2004, a number of anti-angiogenic drugs, which refers to drugs that interfere with blood vessel growth, as described further in the table below, have been approved for a variety of cancer and ophthalmology indications, and development of approved anti-angiogenic drugs for new indications continues.
908259_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	Physician adoption of these first-generation anti-vascular drugs has been rapid and continues to accelerate.
908259_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	While ZYBRESTAT exerts a therapeutic effect similar to existing anti-angiogenic agents, depriving tumors (or, in the case of eye disease, ocular lesions) of blood supply, its mechanism of action is quite different.
908259_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	Consequently, we believe that our VDA drug candidates are second-generation anti-vascular drugs that are potentially complementary to, rather than directly competitive with, existing anti-angiogenic agents, a stance which is supported by the data we have gathered showing an improvement in patient outcomes when both agents are used in combination.
908259_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	In September 2006, we announced the publication of a research article in the journal Science that provided strong scientific evidence for combining VDAs with anti-angiogenic agents such as bevacizumab, a widely-used anti-angiogenic drug that acts by inhibiting VEGF, a pro-angiogenic growth factor.
908259_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	In this article, Professor Kerbel and Dr. Shaked from Sunnybrook Cancer Centre in Canada demonstrated that the combination of ZYBRESTAT and an anti-angiogenic agent, an anti-VEGF-receptor antibody, had synergistic effects on tumors.
908259_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	As illustrated in the table below, VDA and anti-angiogenic drugs act via different mechanisms to produce complementary biological and anti-vascular effects with mostly non-overlapping side effects.
908259_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	In preclinical studies, VDA plus anti-angiogenic drug combinations demonstrate robust and additive anti-tumor effects.
908259_14_ITEM1_P40_S2	Results from initial human clinical studies conducted by us with combinations of ZYBRESTAT and AVASTIN (bevacizumab), provide support and initial clinical validation for combining these agents to significantly increase clinical activity without significantly increasing side-effects.
908259_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	Chronic-chronic hypertension with long- term use; Acute- impairment in wound healing; Hemorrhage, hemoptysis, gastrointestinal perforation, proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, thromboembolic events, etc.
908259_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	Mostly hypertension, effectively controlled; Effects on hematopoiesis and white blood cell counts We believe our VDA drug candidates act on tumor blood vessels via two complementary mechanisms, tubulin depolymerization and disengagement of the junctional protein VE-cadherin, which cause shape change in tumor vascular endothelial cells, vessel occlusion and collapse, and the subsequent blockage of blood-flow to the tumor, which deprives it of oxygen and nutrients essential for survival.
908259_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	In vitro studies have demonstrated that our VDA drug candidates act in a reversible fashion on a protein called tubulin inside newly-formed and growing endothelial cells, such as the vascular endothelial cells comprising tumor vasculature.
908259_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	By binding to the tubulin, ZYBRESTAT is able to collapse the structural framework that maintains the cells flat shape.
908259_14_ITEM1_P42_S3	When this occurs, the shape of the cells changes from flat to round, initiating a cascade of events resulting in physical blockage of the blood vessels.
908259_14_ITEM1_P42_S4	The resulting shutdown in blood-flow then deprives tumor cells of the oxygen and nutrients necessary for maintenance and growth and also prevents tumor cells from being able to excrete toxic metabolic waste products.
908259_14_ITEM1_P42_S5	The consequence of the blockage is extensive tumor cell death, as demonstrated in animal studies and suggested in imaging studies of human patients treated with ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503.
908259_14_ITEM1_P42_S6	Preclinical research, published in the November 2005 issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation, showed that ZYBRESTAT also disrupts the molecular engagement of VE-cadherin, a junctional protein important for endothelial cell survival and function.
908259_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	associated with tumors and other disease processes.
908259_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	The disengagement of VE-cadherin leads to endothelial cell detachment, which in turn, can cause permanent physical blockage of vessels.
908259_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	Preclinical and clinical study results indicate that ZYBRESTAT exerts anti-vascular effects rapidly, within hours of administration, and the half-life of the active form of ZYBRESTAT in humans is approximately four hours.
908259_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	Because the half-life of the active form of ZYBRESTAT is relatively short, the effects of ZYBRESTAT on tubulin are reversible, and ZYBRESTAT is typically administered no more frequently than once per week, the side-effects of ZYBRESTAT are typically transient in nature, limited to the period of time following administration when the active form of ZYBRESTAT is in the body in significant concentrations.
908259_14_ITEM1_P45_S2	This contrasts with drugs that interfere with blood vessel growth, known as anti-angiogenic agents, which are typically administered on a chronic basis so as to constantly maintain levels of drug in the body, exert their tumor blood-vessel growth inhibiting effects over days to weeks, and as a result can cause a variety of chronic side-effects that are not limited to the immediate period following administration.
908259_14_ITEM1_P45_S3	In contrast with anti-angiogenic agents, which can cause a variety of chronic side-effects, side-effects associated with ZYBRESTAT are typically transient and manageable.
908259_14_ITEM1_P45_S4	The most frequent ZYBRESTAT side-effects include infusion-related side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache and fatigue, and tumor pain, which is consistent with the drug s mechanism-of-action.
908259_14_ITEM1_P45_S5	Like approved anti-angiogenic drugs, ZYBRESTAT also exhibits cardiovascular effects, which in the majority of patients are mild and transient in nature.
908259_14_ITEM1_P45_S6	Approximately 10-20% of patients treated with ZYBRESTAT experience clinically-significant and transient hypertension that can be readily managed and prevented after initial occurrence with straightforward oral anti-hypertensive therapy.
908259_14_ITEM1_P45_S7	In an analysis undertaken by us, the incidence of serious cardiovascular side-effects such as angina and myocardial ischemia observed across all studies to date (including early studies in which hypertension management and prevention was not employed) was less than 3%, a frequency comparable to that reported with approved anti-angiogenic agents such as bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib.
908259_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our strategy is to develop innovative therapeutics for oncology and to leverage our drug candidates and technology in the field of ophthalmology.
908259_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	Our principal focus is to advance the clinical development and commercialization of our drug candidates ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503 and to identify new preclinical candidates that are complementary to our VDAs.
908259_14_ITEM1_P46_S2	To advance our strategy, we have established relationships with universities, research organizations and other institutions in these fields.
908259_14_ITEM1_P46_S3	We intend to continue to rely on these relationships, rather than expand our in-house research and development staff.
908259_14_ITEM1_P46_S4	In general, these programs are created, developed and controlled by our internal management.
908259_14_ITEM1_P46_S5	Currently, we have collaborative agreements and arrangements with a number of institutions in the United States and abroad, which we utilize to perform the day-to-day activities associated with drug development.
908259_14_ITEM1_P46_S6	In 2013, collaborations and agreements were ongoing with a variety of university and research institutions, including the following:
908259_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	Gynecologic Oncology Group, or GOG, and the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, or CTEP, of the National Cancer Institute, or NCI.
908259_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	In December 2011, we established a distribution agreement with a Danish company, Azanta Danmark A/S, or Azanta, to provide access to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of patients with ATC on a compassionate use basis in certain specified territories.
908259_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	This agreement was expanded to include additional territories in August 2012 also for treatment on a compassionate use basis.
908259_14_ITEM1_P48_S2	The specified territories include the European Union, including the Nordic countries and Switzerland, Canada, Israel and South Korea.
908259_14_ITEM1_P48_S3	This program, which is managed by Azanta , provides a regulatory mechanism to allow healthcare professionals in the specified territories to prescribe ZYBRESTAT to individual ATC patients while it is still in development.
908259_14_ITEM1_P48_S4	Under the terms of the agreement, we provide ZYBRESTAT to the Danish company, and they serve as our exclusive distributor for ZYBRESTAT in the specified territories for this purpose.
908259_14_ITEM1_P48_S5	The Danish company provides ZYBRESTAT to physicians solely to treat ATC on a compassionate use basis in the specified territories until such time as ZYBRESTAT may obtain marketing approval in that territory.
908259_14_ITEM1_P48_S6	The agreement may be further expanded to include other countries on a country-by-country basis.
908259_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	The Danish company is responsible for all regulatory activities necessary to distribute and sell ZYBRESTAT on a compassionate use basis for the treatment of ATC within the specified territories.
908259_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	There is no transfer of ownership of intellectual property rights for ZYBRESTAT to the Danish company under the terms of the agreement.
908259_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	We have secured a technology license from Arizona State University, or ASU.
908259_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	The ASU license is an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license for commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including among others, ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503.
908259_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	Combretastatins were originally isolated from the bark of the South African Bush Willow tree by researchers from Arizona State University but are now created by synthetic means and have tubulin-dependent anti-vascular and antiproliferative properties.
908259_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	Under the ASU license, we have the right to grant sublicenses.
908259_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	ASU is entitled to single-digit royalty and milestone payments under the license agreement.
908259_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	We bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the ASU license.
908259_14_ITEM1_P53_S1	Under the license agreement, we have agreed to diligently proceed with the development, manufacture and sale of products using the licensed technology.
908259_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	ASU has the first responsibility of enforcing patents under the license agreement.
908259_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	Either party may terminate the license agreement upon material default or bankruptcy of the other party.
908259_14_ITEM1_P54_S2	In addition, we may terminate the agreement by either (i) determining that filing for regulatory approval is not warranted by the clinical testing date or (ii) by providing two months written notice of our intent to terminate the agreement.
908259_14_ITEM1_P54_S3	Payments made to ASU to date have amounted to $2,500,000.
908259_14_ITEM1_P54_S4	The agreement remains in force until the expiration of the last to expire patent subject to the ASU license.
908259_14_ITEM1_P54_S5	Under a sponsored research agreement with Baylor University, we are pursuing discovery and development of additional novel, small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, including small-molecule cathepsin-L inhibitors and hypoxia-activated VDAs.
908259_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	Cathepsin-L is an enzyme involved in protein degradation and has been shown to be closely involved in the processes of angiogenesis and metastasis.
908259_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	Small molecule inhibitors may have the potential to slow tumor growth and metastasis in a manner we believe could be complementary with our VDA therapeutics.
908259_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	We believe that our hypoxia-activated VDAs could serve as line-extension products to ZYBRESTAT and/or OXi4503.
908259_14_ITEM1_P56_S2	We also have an exclusive license from Baylor University to all novel compositions developed for the treatment of vascular disorders, inflammation, parasitic diseases and infections, fungal diseases and infections and/or cancer.
908259_14_ITEM1_P56_S3	We have the right to grant sublicenses under the Baylor license.
908259_14_ITEM1_P56_S4	The agreement with Baylor stipulates that low-single-digit royalties will be paid by us should sales be generated through use of Baylor s compounds.
908259_14_ITEM1_P56_S5	Further, commencing in the first year that we provide no research funding to Baylor University we must pay a minimum annual royalty payment of $40,000.
908259_14_ITEM1_P56_S6	We are not required to pay Baylor for use of Baylor s compounds other than pursuant to this royalty arrangement.
908259_14_ITEM1_P56_S7	We are entitled to file, prosecute and maintain patent applications on products for which we have a license under this agreement.
908259_14_ITEM1_P56_S8	We have made a one-time payment of $50,000 for the licensing fee that was used as a credit against research expenses generated by Baylor.
908259_14_ITEM1_P56_S9	Either party may terminate the license agreement upon material default of the other party.
908259_14_ITEM1_P56_S10	The term of the license shall end upon the expiration of the licensed patents.
908259_14_ITEM1_P56_S11	The latest U.S. patent licensed under this agreement is scheduled to expire in November 2030.
908259_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	We also have an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, for commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including among others, ZYBRESTAT .
908259_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	Under the BMS license, we have the right to grant sublicenses.
908259_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	Under the license agreement, BMS is entitled to low-single-digit royalty payments for all commercial sales plus any remuneration OXiGENE receives for sale of ZYBRESTAT under named patient or compassionate use programs.
908259_14_ITEM1_P57_S3	All licensing fees and milestone payments under the license agreement, in the aggregate amount of $1,080,000, have been paid.
908259_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	We bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the BMS license and have a right, but not a duty, of enforcing patents covered by the license.
908259_14_ITEM1_P58_S1	Either party may terminate the license upon material default of the other party.
908259_14_ITEM1_P58_S2	The term of the license shall end upon the expiration of the licensed patents.
908259_14_ITEM1_P58_S3	The latest United States patent licensed under this agreement is scheduled to expire in December 2021, excluding a patent term extension available under the Hatch-Waxman Act.
908259_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	In June 2012, we secured a royalty-bearing, transferable, worldwide, exclusive license from Angiogene Pharmaceuticals Ltd. to make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, and sell a vascular disrupting agent, such as ZYBRESTAT , for treating neuroendocrine tumors and associated symptoms and syndromes.
908259_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	Under the Angiogene license, we have the right to grant sublicenses.
908259_14_ITEM1_P59_S2	Angiogene is entitled to low single-digit royalty payments and milestone payments under the agreement.
908259_14_ITEM1_P59_S3	Milestone payments are due upon initiation of the first clinical trial for a product using Angiogene intellectual property and initiation of the first registration clinical trial for a product using Angiogene intellectual property.
908259_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	We have the sole right to and bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the Angiogene license.
908259_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	Payments to Angiogene, under this license, to date have amounted to $150,000.
908259_14_ITEM1_P60_S2	The term of the royalty payable under the license will expire on the sooner of (i) ten years from the regulatory approval of a product subject to the license or (ii) launch by a third party of a generic version of the vascular disrupting agent.
908259_14_ITEM1_P60_S3	After the expiry of the royalty term, the license will become fully paid, irrevocable and perpetual.
908259_14_ITEM1_P60_S4	Either party may terminate the license upon material default of the other party, and we may terminate the agreement at will upon sixty days prior notice to Angiogene.
908259_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	REGULATORY MATTERS Government Regulation and Product Approval Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing.
908259_14_ITEM1_P61_S1	Our drugs must be approved by FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States.
908259_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations.
908259_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
908259_14_ITEM1_P62_S2	Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions.
908259_14_ITEM1_P62_S3	These sanctions could include the FDA s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusal of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties.
908259_14_ITEM1_P62_S4	Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
908259_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
908259_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA.
908259_14_ITEM1_P64_S1	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
908259_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development it enters the preclinical testing stage.
908259_14_ITEM1_P65_S1	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies.
908259_14_ITEM1_P65_S2	An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND.
908259_14_ITEM1_P65_S3	The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation.
908259_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	Preclinical testing continues even after the IND is submitted.
908259_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold.
908259_14_ITEM1_P66_S2	In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.
908259_14_ITEM1_P66_S3	Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
908259_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practice regulations.
908259_14_ITEM1_P67_S1	These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
908259_14_ITEM1_P67_S2	Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution.
908259_14_ITEM1_P67_S3	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
908259_14_ITEM1_P67_S4	The IRB also approves the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the study until completed.
908259_14_ITEM1_P67_S5	Each new clinical protocol must be submitted to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval.
908259_14_ITEM1_P67_S6	Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and efficacy in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.
908259_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
908259_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
908259_14_ITEM1_P69_S1	In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
908259_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	Phase 2: Involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate preliminary efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
908259_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites.
908259_14_ITEM1_P71_S1	These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling.
908259_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	During the development of a new drug, sponsors may, under certain circumstances request a special protocol assessment, or SPA, from the FDA.
908259_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	clinical trial that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in an NDA.
908259_14_ITEM1_P73_S1	The request, which must be made prior to commencing the trial, must include the proposed protocol and protocol-specific questions that the sponsor would like the FDA to answer regarding the protocol design, study goals and data analysis for the proposed investigation.
908259_14_ITEM1_P73_S2	After receiving the request, the FDA will consider whether the submission is appropriate for an SPA.
908259_14_ITEM1_P73_S3	If an SPA is appropriate, the FDA will base its assessment on the questions posed by the sponsor.
908259_14_ITEM1_P73_S4	Comments from the FDA review team are supposed to be sent to the sponsor within 45 calendar days of receipt of the request.
908259_14_ITEM1_P73_S5	The sponsor may request a meeting to discuss the comments and any remaining issues and uncertainties regarding the protocol.
908259_14_ITEM1_P73_S6	If the sponsor and the FDA reach agreement regarding the protocol, the agreement will be documented and made part of the administrative record.
908259_14_ITEM1_P73_S7	This agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins, except (1) with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or (2) if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began.
908259_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA.
908259_14_ITEM1_P74_S1	IND Safety Reports must be submitted to the FDA, IRBs and the investigators for (a) any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected; (b) any findings from epidemiological studies, pooled analysis of multiple studies, or clinical studies (other than those already reported in (a)); (c) any findings from animal or in vitro testing, whether or not conducted by the sponsor, that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug, such as reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure; and (d) any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
908259_14_ITEM1_P74_S2	Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
908259_14_ITEM1_P74_S3	The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
908259_14_ITEM1_P74_S4	Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
908259_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
908259_14_ITEM1_P75_S1	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug.
908259_14_ITEM1_P75_S2	Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
908259_14_ITEM1_P75_S3	The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product.
908259_14_ITEM1_P75_S4	The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances, which may include orphan drug status and the first NDA application for a company.
908259_14_ITEM1_P75_S5	In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective.
908259_14_ITEM1_P75_S6	The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
908259_14_ITEM1_P75_S7	Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
908259_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing.
908259_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing.
908259_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information.
908259_14_ITEM1_P76_S3	The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
908259_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
908259_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
908259_14_ITEM1_P78_S1	The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
908259_14_ITEM1_P78_S2	The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information.
908259_14_ITEM1_P78_S3	Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
908259_14_ITEM1_P78_S4	Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
908259_14_ITEM1_P78_S5	The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA.
908259_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product s identity, strength, quality and purity.
908259_14_ITEM1_P80_S0	Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.
908259_14_ITEM1_P80_S1	The FDA will also inspect selected clinical sites that participated in the clinical studies and may inspect the testing facilities that performed the GLP toxicology studies cited in the NDA.
908259_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	NDAs receive either standard or priority review.
908259_14_ITEM1_P81_S1	A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review.
908259_14_ITEM1_P81_S2	In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
908259_14_ITEM1_P81_S3	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials.
908259_14_ITEM1_P81_S4	Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process.
908259_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
908259_14_ITEM1_P82_S1	In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized.
908259_14_ITEM1_P83_S0	Orphan Drug Designation Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug.
908259_14_ITEM1_P83_S1	Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA.
908259_14_ITEM1_P83_S2	After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
908259_14_ITEM1_P83_S3	Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
908259_14_ITEM1_P83_S4	If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years.
908259_14_ITEM1_P83_S5	Orphan drug exclusivity, however, also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor s product for the same indication or disease.
908259_14_ITEM1_P84_S0	In the European Union and Japan, orphan drug exclusivity regulations provide for 10 years of marketing exclusivity for orphan drugs that are approved for the treatment of rare diseases or conditions.
908259_14_ITEM1_P84_S1	ZYBRESTAT was awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of anaplastic, medullary, Stage IV papillary and Stage IV follicular thyroid cancers and ovarian cancer.
908259_14_ITEM1_P84_S2	OXi4503 was awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia.
908259_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	ZYBRESTAT was also awarded orphan drug status by the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer and ovarian cancer.
908259_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	Expedited Review and Approval The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints.
908259_14_ITEM1_P86_S1	Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, we cannot be sure that the FDA will not later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened.
908259_14_ITEM1_P86_S2	Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments.
908259_14_ITEM1_P87_S0	Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied.
908259_14_ITEM1_P87_S1	Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review.
908259_14_ITEM1_P88_S0	Drugs that receive an accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect of a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
908259_14_ITEM1_P88_S1	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials.
908259_14_ITEM1_P88_S2	The FDA has granted Fast Track designation to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of regionally advanced and/or metastatic ATC.
908259_14_ITEM1_P89_S0	Foreign Regulation Before our products can be marketed outside of the United States, they are subject to regulatory approval similar to that required in the United States, although the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, including additional clinical trials that may be required, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country.
908259_14_ITEM1_P89_S1	No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country.
908259_14_ITEM1_P90_S0	The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval.
908259_14_ITEM1_P90_S1	In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved.
908259_14_ITEM1_P90_S2	The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted.
908259_14_ITEM1_P90_S3	Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices may not be approved for such product.
908259_14_ITEM1_P91_S0	In Europe, marketing authorizations may be submitted through a centralized, a decentralized or mutual recognition procedure.
908259_14_ITEM1_P91_S1	The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all European Union members states.
908259_14_ITEM1_P91_S2	The centralized procedure is also mandatory for cancer indications and orphan drug products.
908259_14_ITEM1_P91_S3	Based on these requirements, the centralized procedure would be used for OXiGENE products for ATC or for ovarian cancer indications.
908259_14_ITEM1_P92_S0	In Europe, alternative pathways for marketing approval include conditional approval or approval under exceptional circumstances.
908259_14_ITEM1_P92_S1	These pathways are available for drugs to treat serious or debilitating diseases and/or orphan drugs.
908259_14_ITEM1_P93_S0	Both conditional approval and approval under exceptional circumstances require a positive risk/benefit balance.
908259_14_ITEM1_P93_S1	Under conditional approval it is expected that additional clinical studies would support the lack of comprehensive clinical data provided at the time of the filing.
908259_14_ITEM1_P93_S2	Approval under exceptional circumstances is possible when the indication is so rare that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive clinical data.
908259_14_ITEM1_P93_S3	We are evaluating the potential benefits of seeking approval under exceptional circumstances for the use of ZYBRESTAT in ATC.
908259_14_ITEM1_P93_S4	We cannot assure you that we will receive this approval for marketing in Europe.
908259_14_ITEM1_P93_S5	We are currently pursuing a potential filing for a marketing authorization, or MAA, in the EU with ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of ATC under exceptional circumstances.
908259_14_ITEM1_P94_S0	We intend to address and incorporate this feedback into our potential MAA filing, and we believe that it is possible that we could obtain an MAA for the use of ZYBRESTAT in the treatment of ATC with the existing clinical data that we have.
908259_14_ITEM1_P94_S1	If we are successful in obtaining an MAA for ZYBRESTAT in the treatment of ATC, we believe that this could lead to similar authorizations in other countries such as Japan, South Korea, China, or Canada (but not in the United States).
908259_14_ITEM1_P95_S0	We actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including chemical species, compositions and forms, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, as well as modified forms of naturally-expressed receptors, in the United States and other jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets.
908259_14_ITEM1_P95_S1	We also rely upon trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information.
908259_14_ITEM1_P95_S2	As of March 17, 2014, we were the exclusive licensee, sole assignee or co-assignee of twenty-nine (29) granted U.S. patents, seven (7) pending U.S. patent applications, two (2) pending Patent Cooperation Treaty international patent applications and granted patents and/or pending applications in several other major markets, including the European Union, Canada and Japan.
908259_14_ITEM1_P95_S3	Our policy is to file U.S. and foreign patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business.
908259_14_ITEM1_P95_S4	There can be no assurance that any of these patent applications will result in the grant of a patent either in the United States or elsewhere, or that any patents granted will be valid and enforceable, or will provide a competitive advantage or will afford protection against competitors with similar technologies.
908259_14_ITEM1_P95_S5	We also intend to rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel drugs.
908259_14_ITEM1_P95_S6	We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements.
908259_14_ITEM1_P95_S7	We consider the following U.S. patents owned by or exclusively licensed to us to be particularly important to the protection of our most advanced product candidates.
908259_14_ITEM1_P96_S0	In addition to these patents, for some of our product candidates, we have patents and/or applications that cover a particular form or composition, use for a particular indication, use as part of combination therapy or method of preparation or use, as well as other pending patent applications.
908259_14_ITEM1_P96_S1	These issued patents, including any patents that issue from pending applications, could provide additional or a longer period of protection.
908259_14_ITEM1_P96_S2	We also have patent applications pending that seek equivalent or substantially comparable protection for our product candidates in jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets.
908259_14_ITEM1_P97_S0	The patent expiration dates referenced above do not reflect any potential patent term extension that we may receive under the federal Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
908259_14_ITEM1_P97_S1	The Hatch-Waxman Act generally permits a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
908259_14_ITEM1_P97_S2	Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years.
908259_14_ITEM1_P98_S0	The patent term restoration period is generally one-half of the time between the effective date of an investigational new drug application, or IND, and the submission date of a new drug application, or NDA, plus the time between the submission date and approval date of an NDA.
908259_14_ITEM1_P99_S0	Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent.
908259_14_ITEM1_P100_S0	The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for patent term extension.
908259_14_ITEM1_P101_S0	COMPETITION The industry in which we are engaged is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition.
908259_14_ITEM1_P101_S1	Our competitors include, among others, major pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, many of which have financial, technical and marketing resources significantly greater than ours.
908259_14_ITEM1_P101_S2	In addition, many of the small companies that compete with us have also formed collaborative relationships with large, established companies to support research, development, clinical trials and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours.
908259_14_ITEM1_P101_S3	Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or through joint ventures or other collaborations.
908259_14_ITEM1_P102_S0	We are aware of a limited number of companies involved in the development of VDAs.
908259_14_ITEM1_P102_S1	Such companies include Bionomics, Epicept, and MediciNova, all of which have VDAs that we believe are at an earlier or similar stage of clinical development than our lead drug candidate, ZYBRESTAT .
908259_14_ITEM1_P102_S2	We expect that, if any of our products gain regulatory approval for sale, they will compete primarily on the basis of product efficacy, safety, patient convenience, reliability, price and patent protection.
908259_14_ITEM1_P102_S3	Our competitive position will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop effective proprietary products and implement joint ventures or other alliances with large pharmaceutical companies in order to jointly market and manufacture our products.
908259_14_ITEM1_P102_S4	EMPLOYEES We expect to continue to maintain a relatively small number of executives and other employees.
908259_14_ITEM1_P102_S5	We rely on outsourcing for much of our research, development, preclinical testing and clinical trial activity, although we maintain managerial and quality control over our clinical trials.
908259_14_ITEM1_P102_S6	As of March 17, 2014, we had a total of nine full-time employees and one employee working on a part-time basis.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	statements that may be made by us or by officers, directors or employees acting on our behalf, that are not historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from the historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors set forth below.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS We will be required to raise additional funds to finance our operations, continue the development of our product candidates and remain a going concern; we may not be able to do so when necessary, and/or the terms of any financings may not be advantageous to us.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Negative cash flows from our operations are expected to continue over at least the next several years.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	patients in our human clinical trials.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	In addition, the further development of our ongoing clinical trials will depend on upcoming analysis and results of those studies and our financial resources at that time.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We are aggressively pursuing forms of capital infusion including public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements with organizations that have capabilities and/or products that are complementary to our own capabilities and/or products, in order to continue the development of our product candidates.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	However, there can be no assurances that we will complete any financings strategic alliances or collaborative development agreements, and the terms of such arrangements may not be advantageous to us.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P2_S4	After our recent financing in February 2014 and subsequent exercises of warrants to purchase our common stock, we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents to support our operations through at least the end of 2015.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P2_S5	We expect this level of cash utilization to allow us to continue our ongoing programs, including wrap up costs of completing the GOG 186I trial, initial startup costs of planning for a pivotal Phase 3 study in ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of advanced relapsed ovarian cancer, initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial of ZYBRESTAT in patients with recurrent GI-NETs with elevated biomarkers and, if we finalize an agreement with a non-profit collaborator, to initiate and share in the costs of a Phase 1b/2 trial of ZYBRESTAT in relapsed ovarian cancer in combination with Votrient .
908259_14_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Any significant further development of ZYBRESTAT such as conducting pivotal Phase 3 studies in ovarian cancer or other capital intensive activities will be contingent upon our ability to raise additional capital in addition to our existing financing arrangements.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Our ongoing capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including: the progress and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates under development; the costs of complying with FDA and other regulatory agency requirements, the progress of our research and development programs and those of our partners; the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals; our ability to enter into licensing arrangements, including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs; the costs and expenses of filing, prosecuting and, if necessary, enforcing our patent claims, or defending against possible claims of infringement by third-party patent or other technology rights; the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, if any, undertaken by us; and, if and when approved, the demand for our products, which demand depends in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known, understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval, including the range of indications for which any product is granted approval.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P2_S8	While we potentially have access to certain amounts of financing through an agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC and through an At Market Issuance Sales Arrangement, which we refer to as the ATM, with MLV Co. LLC, these arrangements alone will not be sufficient to fund a late-stage clinical trial of ZYBRESTAT in any indication.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P2_S9	We do not have the ability to direct Lincoln Park Capital to purchase any of our common stock if we fail to maintain a minimum stock price of $6.00 (adjusted for stock splits).
908259_14_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Under the ATM, the total dollar amount of common stock that we could sell under our current registration statement during the next twelve months, as of March 17, 2014, is approximately $264,000.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P2_S11	However, we are restricted by the terms of the securities purchase agreements that we entered into during 2013 and 2014 from making sales under this agreement until November 2014.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P2_S12	If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we will not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we will be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs or cease operations.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P2_S13	We may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P2_S14	Any additional equity financing, whether through the ATM, the Lincoln Park Capital arrangement or otherwise, may be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish, on terms that are not favorable to us, rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our failure to raise capital when needed will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our ability to raise additional capital could also be impaired if our common shares lose their status on The NASDAQ Capital Market.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Due in part to our limited financial resources, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates or those that are in-licensed, and/or we may be unable to pursue the clinical trials that we would like to pursue.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We have limited technical, managerial and financial resources to determine the indications on which we should focus the development efforts related to our product candidates.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Due to our limited available financial resources, we have curtailed clinical development programs and activities that might otherwise have led to more rapid progress of our product candidates through the regulatory and development processes.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We may make incorrect determinations with regard to the indications and clinical trials on which to focus the available resources that we do have.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P4_S5	We or our partners currently are pursuing clinical trials in various indications, but we are required by our financial resources to engage only in limited clinical activities.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P4_S6	The decisions to allocate our research, management and financial resources toward particular indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P4_S7	Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate drug development programs may also cause us to miss valuable opportunities.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P4_S8	In addition, from time to time, we may in-license or otherwise acquire product candidates to supplement our internal development activities.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P4_S9	Those activities may use resources that otherwise would have been devoted to our internal programs.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P4_S10	We cannot assure you that any resources that we devote to acquired or in-licensed programs will result in any products that are superior to our internally developed products.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P4_S11	If we are unable to obtain required regulatory approvals, we will be unable to market and sell our product candidates.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P4_S12	Our product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to development, clinical trials, manufacturing, oversight of clinical investigators, recordkeeping and commercialization.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P4_S13	Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory review and approval process are required to be successfully completed in the United States, in the EU and in many other foreign jurisdictions before a new drug can be sold.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P4_S14	Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain, and subject to unanticipated delays.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P4_S15	The time required to obtain approval by the FDA or EMA is unpredictable and often exceeds five years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the complexity of the product candidate.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P4_S16	In connection with the clinical development of our product candidates, we face risks that:
908259_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	the results from clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance or clinical benefit-to-risk ratio required by the FDA, EMA or other regulatory agencies for marketing approval.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Only a small percentage of product candidates for which clinical trials are initiated are the subject of NDAs and even fewer receive approval for commercialization.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Furthermore, even if we do receive regulatory approval to market a product candidate, any such approval may be subject to limitations such as those on the indicated uses for which we may market the product.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	In particular, we may pursue a filing for a marketing authorization, or MAA, in the EU with ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of ATC under exceptional circumstances.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	As part of this process, we solicited and received feedback from the SAWP of the EMA, in July 2013, and from two of the SAWP reviewing countries in March 2013 and two more in February 2014, regarding the data that would be deemed necessary to support an MAA filing in Europe under exceptional circumstances.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We intend to address and incorporate this feedback into our potential MAA filing using existing data from previous completed clinical trials of ZYBRESTAT .
908259_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We cannot, however, assure you that this process will result in our receipt of approval from the EMA to market ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of ATC.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P6_S4	The EMA could require us to conduct one or more additional clinical trials involving patients with ATC or to conduct other studies or analysis in order to obtain approval.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P6_S5	We do not currently believe that it would be practicable from a financial standpoint for us to conduct an additional clinical trial in this indication, given the very significant expense of locating patients with this ultra-rare disease and extremely rapid progression of the disease following diagnosis.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P6_S6	In the event that additional clinical trials or other studies were to be required by the EMA as a condition of approval, we would likely elect to discontinue the efforts to obtain a marketing authorization for ZYBRESTAT in ATC in the EU.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P6_S7	If we or the third parties on which we rely for the conduct of our clinical trials and results do not perform our clinical trial activities in accordance with good clinical practices and related regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P6_S8	We use independent clinical investigators and, in many cases, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct and/or oversee the clinical trials of our product candidates and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P6_S9	We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P6_S10	Nonetheless, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the FDA s requirements and our general investigational plan and protocol.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P6_S11	Currently our only clinical trial activities involving ZYBRESTAT are being conducted by physician clinical investigators who are independent of us, but with whom we have agreements for them to provide the results of their clinical trials to us.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P6_S12	In order for us to rely on data from these ongoing studies in support of a marketing application, or NDA, for approval of any of our product candidates by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the independent investigators are required to comply with FDA requirements applicable to their studies.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P6_S13	The FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities require us and our clinical investigators to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting and recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P6_S14	Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P6_S15	Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or the respective trial plans and protocols.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P6_S16	The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates or result in enforcement action against us.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In February 2012, we were inspected by the FDA, and in March 2012, we received a Form FDA 483 containing observations from that inspection.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The Form FDA 483 noted observations of certain deficiencies in the conduct of our FACT trial in ATC, which was conducted from July 2007 February 2010.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	These observations related to the FDA s good clinical practice requirements and included the failure to insure proper monitoring of third-party clinical investigators who were participants in our FACT trial, the failure to promptly bring non-compliant clinical investigators into compliance, and also found that some of the clinical trial monitors selected by our clinical research organizations, or CROs, outside the United States were not sufficiently qualified by experience and training to monitor clinical trials.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	The Form FDA 483 also included observations related to the failure to address the improper storage of a drug that was being used in the trial, and the failure to maintain records and case histories in compliance with FDA regulations.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The issues noted in the Form FDA 483 had previously been identified and addressed by our management as part of an internal review of our systems, practices and procedures governing the areas of vendor oversight, quality, and regulatory compliance and were initially disclosed by us in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2009.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	On February 10, 2014, we received correspondence from the FDA informing us that we appear to have taken corrective action to prevent the recurrence of the conditions that led to the issuance of the Form FDA 483 and that the related inspection is now closed.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	While we have taken and continue to take steps to strengthen our procedures in order to ensure that these issues will not recur in any future clinical trials sponsored by us for any of our product candidates, we cannot assure you that the FDA will be satisfied with our procedures, that the FDA will not issue a warning letter or take other enforcement action against us, or that similar issues will not recur in the future.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We also cannot assure you that the Form FDA 483 will not adversely affect our potential application to the EMA for an MAA for ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of ATC.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	In addition, the steps we take to strengthen our procedures and conduct future clinical trials necessary for approval will be time-consuming and expensive.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	As we evolve from a company that is primarily involved in clinical development to a company that is also involved in commercialization, we may encounter difficulties in expanding our operations successfully.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P9_S5	As we advance our product candidates through clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P9_S6	As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with such third parties, as well as additional collaborators, distributors, marketers and suppliers.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Maintaining third party relationships for these purposes will impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management and other personnel.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P9_S8	We must be able to: manage our development efforts effectively; manage our participation in the clinical trials in which our product candidates are involved effectively; and improve our managerial, development, operational and finance systems, all of which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P9_S9	If we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing or distribution services, any product revenues that we receive, or the profitability of these product revenues to us, are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P9_S10	In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our products or in doing so on terms that are favorable to us.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P9_S11	We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P9_S12	If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our products.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P9_S13	We have no manufacturing capacity and have relied on, and expect to continue to rely on, third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P9_S14	We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates or any of the compounds that we are testing in our preclinical programs, and we lack the resources and the capabilities to do so.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P9_S15	As a result, we currently rely, and we expect to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party manufacturers to supply our product candidates.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P9_S16	Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our product candidates or products ourselves, including:
908259_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	the possible termination or non-renewal of the manufacturing agreements by the third-party, at a time that is costly or inconvenient to us.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	If we do not maintain our developed important manufacturing relationships, we may fail to find replacement manufacturers or develop our own manufacturing capabilities, which could delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products and substantially increase our costs or deplete profit margins, if any.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	If we do find replacement manufacturers, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us, and there could be a substantial delay before new facilities could be qualified and registered with the FDA, EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The FDA, EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities require manufacturers to register manufacturing facilities.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The FDA and corresponding foreign regulators also inspect these facilities to confirm compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Contract manufacturers may face manufacturing or quality control problems causing drug substance production and shipment delays or a situation where the contractor may not be able to maintain compliance with the applicable cGMP requirements.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Any failure to comply with cGMP requirements or other FDA, EMA and comparable foreign regulatory requirements could adversely affect our clinical research activities and our ability to develop our product candidates and market our products after approval.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop our product candidates and commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely basis.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Our product candidates have not completed clinical trials, and may never demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in order to do so.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Our product candidates are in the clinical stage of development.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P12_S7	In order to achieve profitable operations, we alone or in collaboration with others, must successfully develop, manufacture, introduce and market our products.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P12_S8	The time frame necessary to achieve market success for any individual product is long and uncertain.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P12_S9	The products currently under development by us may require significant additional research and development and additional preclinical and clinical testing prior to application for commercial use.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P12_S10	Although we are pursuing a filing an MAA with the EMA to market and sell ZYBRESTAT , we cannot assure you that the EMA will approve this application without the need for further clinical trials or other studies, which may be prohibitively expensive.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	A number of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after showing promising results in early or later-stage studies or clinical trials.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Although we have obtained some favorable results to-date in preclinical studies and clinical trials of certain of our potential products, such results may not be indicative of results that will ultimately be obtained in or throughout such clinical trials, and clinical trials may not show any of our products to be safe or capable of producing a desired result.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Additionally, we may encounter problems in our clinical trials that may cause us to delay, suspend or terminate those clinical trials.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Our product candidates have been tested in over 400 patients to date, and adverse events associated with ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503 have been found to be mainly low grade, reversible, transient and manageable.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P13_S4	However, we will be required to continue to test and evaluate the safety of our product candidates in additional clinical trials, and to demonstrate their safety to the satisfaction of appropriate regulatory agencies, as a condition to receipt of any regulatory approvals.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In clinical trials to date, transient mild to moderate hypertension believed to be associated with ZYBRESTAT has been effectively managed through pre-treatment with antihypertensive medication.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to make the necessary demonstrations of safety to allow us to receive regulatory approval for our product candidates in any indication.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If we proceed with the filing of an MAA in the European Union for ZYBRESTAT in the treatment of ATC, we would need to undertake commercial scale manufacturing activities at significant expense to us in order to proceed with the application for approval for commercialization.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We or our external vendors may encounter technical difficulties that preclude us from successfully manufacturing the required registration and validation batches of active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and/or drug product and we may be unable to recover any financial losses associated with the manufacturing activities.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	developed into drugs, any potential products may not receive regulatory approval on a timely basis, if at all, and competitors may develop and bring to market products or technologies that render our potential products obsolete.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	If any of these problems occur, our business would be materially and adversely affected.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We only have a limited number of employees to manage and operate our business.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	As of March 17, 2014, we had a total of nine full-time employees and one employee working on a part-time basis.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our focus on reducing cash utilization requires us to manage and operate our business in a highly efficient manner.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We have a history of losses, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We have experienced net losses every year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2013, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $238,508,000.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S4	We anticipate continuing to incur substantial additional losses over at least the next several years due to, among other factors, our continuing clinical trials and development activities with respect to our VDA drug candidates, technologies, and anticipated research and development activities and the general and administrative expenses associated with those activities.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S5	We have not yet commercialized any product candidates.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Our ability to attain profitability will depend upon our ability to develop and commercialize products that are effective and commercially viable, to obtain regulatory approval for the manufacture and sale of our products and to license or otherwise market our products successfully.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S7	We may never achieve profitability, and even if we do, we may not be able to sustain being profitable.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S8	We depend heavily on our executive officers, directors, and principal consultants and the loss of their services would materially harm our business.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S9	We believe that our success depends, and will likely continue to depend, upon our ability to retain the services of our current executive officers, directors, principal consultants and others.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S10	The loss of the services of any of these individuals would have a material adverse effect on our business.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S11	In addition, we have established relationships with universities, hospitals and research institutions, which have historically provided, and continue to provide, us with access to research laboratories, clinical trials, facilities and patients.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S12	Additionally, we believe that we may, at any time and from time to time, materially depend on the services of consultants and other unaffiliated third parties.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S13	We cannot assure you that consultants and other unaffiliated third parties will provide the level of service to us that we require in order to achieve our business objectives.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S14	Our industry is highly competitive, and our product candidates may become obsolete.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S15	We are engaged in a rapidly evolving field.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S16	Competition from other pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and research and academic institutions is intense and likely to increase.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S17	Many of those companies and institutions have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S18	Those companies and institutions also have substantially greater experience in developing products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and in manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P16_S19	Our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for competitive products.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We are aware of at least three other companies that currently have a clinical-stage VDA for use in an oncology indication.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Some of these competitive products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing the desired therapeutic effect than products being developed by us.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Our competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective and/or cost competitive than those we are developing, or that would render our product candidates less competitive or even obsolete.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	In addition, one or more of our competitors may achieve product commercialization or patent protection earlier than we do, which could materially adversely affect us.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P18_S4	We have licensed in rights to ZYBRESTAT , OXi4503 and other programs from third parties.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P18_S5	If our license agreements terminate or expire, we may lose the licensed rights to our product candidates, including ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503, and we may not be able to continue to develop them or, if they are approved, market or commercialize them.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We depend on license agreements with third-parties for certain intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates, including patent rights.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Currently, we have licensed in patent rights from Arizona State University, or ASU, and the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company for ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503 and from Baylor University and Angiogene Pharmaceuticals Ltd. for other programs.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In general, our license agreements require us to make payments and satisfy performance obligations in order to keep these agreements in effect and retain our rights under them.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	These payment obligations can include upfront fees, maintenance fees, milestones, royalties, patent prosecution expenses, and other fees.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P19_S4	These performance obligations typically include diligence obligations.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P19_S5	If we fail to pay, be diligent or otherwise perform as required under our license agreements, we could lose the rights under the patents and other intellectual property rights covered by the agreements.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P19_S6	While we are not currently aware of any dispute with any licensors under our material agreements with them, if disputes arise under any of our in-licenses, including our in-licenses from ASU, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Baylor University and Angiogene Pharmaceuticals Ltd., we could lose our rights under these agreements.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Any such dispute may not be resolvable on favorable terms, or at all.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P19_S8	Whether or not any disputes of this kind are favorably resolved, our management s time and attention and our other resources could be consumed by the need to attend to and seek to resolve these disputes and our business could be harmed by the emergence of such a dispute.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P19_S9	If we lose our rights under these agreements, we may not be able to conduct any further activities with the product candidate or program that the license covered.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P19_S10	If this were to happen, we might not be able to develop our product candidates further, or following regulatory approval, if any, we might be prohibited from marketing or commercializing them.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P19_S11	In particular, patents previously licensed to us might after termination be used to stop us from conducting these activities.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P19_S12	We depend extensively on our patents and proprietary technology, and we must protect those assets in order to preserve our business.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P19_S13	Although we expect to seek patent protection for any compounds we discover and/or for any specific use we discover for new or previously known compounds, any or all of them may not be subject to effective patent protection.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P19_S14	Further, the development of regimens for the administration of pharmaceuticals, which generally involve specifications for the frequency, timing and amount of dosages, has been, and we believe, may continue to be, important to our effort, although those processes, as such, may not be patentable.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P19_S15	In addition, the issued patents may be declared invalid or our competitors may find ways to avoid the claims in the patents.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P19_S16	Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, protect our trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P19_S17	As of March 17, 2014, we were the exclusive licensee, sole assignee or co-assignee of twenty-nine (29) granted United States patents, seven (7) pending United States patent applications, two (2) pending Patent Cooperation Treaty international patent applications and granted patents and/or pending applications in several other major markets, including the European Union, Canada and Japan.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms like us is generally highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions, resulting in both an apparent inconsistency regarding the breadth of claims allowed in United States patents and general uncertainty as to their legal interpretation and enforceability.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Accordingly, patent applications assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not result in patents being issued, any issued patents assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not provide us with competitive protection or may be challenged by others, and the current or future granted patents of others may have an adverse effect on our ability to do business and achieve profitability.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Moreover, because some of the basic research relating to one or more of our patent applications and/or patents were performed at various universities and/or funded by grants, one or more universities, employees of such universities and/or grantors could assert that they have certain rights in such research and any resulting products.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Further, others may independently develop similar products, may duplicate our products, or may design around our patent rights.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In addition, as a result of the assertion of rights by a third-party or otherwise, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of others in or outside of the United States.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Any licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights may not be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P20_S6	If we do not obtain such licenses, we could encounter delays in product market introductions while our attempts to design around such patents or could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is foreclosed.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against us or in connection with patents to which we hold licenses or in bringing suit to protect our own patents against infringement.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We require employees and the institutions that perform our preclinical and clinical trials to enter into confidentiality agreements with us.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Those agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to a party to any such agreement during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third-parties, except in specific circumstances.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Any such agreement may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Our products may result in product liability exposure, and it is uncertain whether our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all claims.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	The use of our product candidates in clinical trials and for commercial applications, if any, may expose us to liability claims, in the event such product candidates cause injury or disease, or result in adverse effects.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P22_S5	These claims could be made directly by health care institutions, contract laboratories, patients or others using such products.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Although we have obtained liability insurance coverage for our ongoing clinical trials, this coverage may not be in amounts sufficient to protect us from any product liability claims or product recalls which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Further, adverse product and similar liability claims could negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our technology and product candidates under development.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P22_S8	If clinical trials or regulatory approval processes for our product candidates are prolonged, delayed or suspended, we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis, which would require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any revenue from potential product sales.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P22_S9	We cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or any regulatory authority to delay or suspend those clinical trials or delay the analysis of data derived from them.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P22_S10	A number of events, including any of the following, could delay the completion of our other ongoing and planned clinical trials and negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and to market and sell, a particular product candidate:
908259_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	failure of our third-party contractors to comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise meet their contractual obligations to us.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed by the imposition of additional conditions on our clinical trials by the FDA, EMA or another foreign regulatory authority or the requirement of additional supportive studies by the FDA, EMA or another foreign regulatory authority.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In addition, clinical trials require sufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the conduct of other clinical trials that compete for the same patients as our clinical trials, and the eligibility criteria for our clinical trials.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	completion of the clinical trial beyond our expectations.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In addition, the FDA and EMA could require us to conduct clinical trials with a larger number of subjects than we have projected for any of our product candidates.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in a timely or cost-effective manner.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Furthermore, enrolled patients may drop out of our clinical trials, which could impair the validity or statistical significance of the clinical trials.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P24_S4	We do not know whether our clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured, or will be completed on schedule, if at all.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Delays in our clinical trials will result in increased development costs for our product candidates, and our financial resources may be insufficient to fund any incremental costs.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P24_S6	In addition, if our clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be limited.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P24_S7	Our product candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory review even if they receive marketing approval, and if we fail to comply with continuing regulations, we could lose these approvals and the sale of any approved commercial products could be suspended.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P24_S8	Even if we receive regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, and record keeping related to the product will remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P24_S9	If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA, EMA and other applicable domestic and foreign regulatory authorities or previously unknown problems with any approved product, manufacturer, or manufacturing process are discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:
908259_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If physicians and patients do not accept our future products or if the market for indications for which any product candidate is approved is smaller than expected, we may be unable to generate significant revenue, if any.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Even if any of our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, and third-party payers.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Physicians may decide not to recommend our drugs for a variety of reasons including:
908259_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	ineffective marketing and distribution support of our products.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	If any of our product candidates are approved, but fail to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenue and our business would suffer.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The uncertainty associated with pharmaceutical reimbursement and related matters may adversely affect our business.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Market acceptance and sales of any one or more of our product candidates that we develop will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will cover and establish payment levels.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We cannot be certain that reimbursement will be available for any product candidates that we develop.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Also, we cannot be certain that reimbursement policies will not reduce the demand for, or the price paid for, our products.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	If reimbursement is not available or is available on a limited basis, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidates that we develop.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The legislation established Medicare Part D, which expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drug purchases by the elderly but provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The United States and several foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P30_S3	We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any products that we develop due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, ACA, became law in the U.S.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The goal of ACA is to reduce the cost of health care and substantially change the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	While we cannot predict what impact on federal reimbursement policies this legislation will have in general or on our business specifically, the ACA may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of, and the price we may charge for, any products we develop that receive regulatory approval.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	We also cannot predict the impact of ACA on us as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions, which have not yet been fully implemented.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Our facility with Lincoln Park Capital will not be sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements for all of our contemplated clinical trials.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In November 2011, we entered into a purchase agreement for the sale, from time to time, of up to $20,000,000 of our common stock to Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, or LPC, a Chicago-based institutional investor.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We do not have the ability to sell shares under this arrangement if we fail to maintain a minimum stock price of $6.00 or if we fail to maintain the effectiveness of a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	over a 36-month period, in amounts of up to $200,000, which amounts may be increased under certain circumstances.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The price of our common stock as of March 17, 2014 was $4.26 and therefore the facility is not available to us at this time and may not be available when needed, or at all, depending on the market price of our common stock.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The extent to which we rely on LPC as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors, including the prevailing market price of our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P33_S3	If obtaining sufficient funding from LPC were to prove impracticable or prohibitively dilutive, we will need to secure another source of funding in order to satisfy our working capital needs.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Even if we sell the maximum amount we are eligible to sell to LPC under the purchase agreement, we will still need additional capital to fully implement our business, operating and development plans.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P33_S6	Our facility with MLV will not be sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements for all of our contemplated clinical trials.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	On July 21, 2010, we entered into an at the market equity offering sales agreement, or ATM Agreement, with MLV Co. LLC (MLV), pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through MLV acting as our sales agent and underwriter.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Sales of our common stock through MLV are made on the principal trading market of our common stock by means of ordinary brokers transactions at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by MLV and us.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	MLV uses its commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock from time to time, based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits we may impose).
908259_14_ITEM1A_P34_S3	We pay MLV a commission rate of up to 7.0% of the gross sales price per share of any common stock sold through MLV as agent under the ATM Agreement.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P34_S4	As of March 17, 2014, the total dollar amount of common stock that we could sell under the ATM Agreement, during the next twelve months is approximately $264,000 under our current registration statement.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P34_S5	However, we are restricted by the terms of the securities purchase agreements that we entered into during 2013 and 2014 from making sales under this agreement until November 2014.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The funding available from MLV may not be available when needed, or at all, depending on the market price of our common stock.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	The extent to which we rely on MLV as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors, including the prevailing market price of our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If obtaining sufficient funding from MLV were to prove impracticable or prohibitively dilutive, we will need to secure another source of funding in order to satisfy our working capital needs.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Even if we sell the maximum amount we are eligible to sell to MLV under the purchase agreement, we will still need additional capital to fully implement our business, operating and development plans.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Our restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated by-laws, our stockholder rights agreement and Delaware law could deter a change of our management which could discourage or delay offers to acquire us.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P35_S6	Certain provisions of Delaware law and of our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated by-laws, could discourage or make it more difficult to accomplish a proxy contest or other change in our management or the acquisition of control by a holder of a substantial amount of our voting stock.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P35_S7	It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish, or could deter, transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interests or our best interests.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P35_S8	Further, the rights issued under the stockholder rights agreement would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our Board of Directors.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P35_S9	The price of our common stock is volatile, and is likely to continue to fluctuate due to reasons beyond our control.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P35_S10	The market price of our common stock has been, and likely will continue to be, highly volatile.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	announcements and government regulatory action affecting our potential products in both the United States and foreign countries, have had, and may continue to have, a significant effect on our results of operations and on the market price of our common stock.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We cannot assure you that an investment in our common stock will not fluctuate significantly.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	One or more of these factors could significantly harm our business and cause a decline in the price of our common stock in the public market.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Substantially all of the shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants have been registered for resale or are available for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may be sold from time to time.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Such sales, as well as future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders, or the perception that sales may occur at any time, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The low trading volume of our common stock may adversely affect the price of our shares.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Although our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock has historically experienced low trading volume.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Limited trading volume may subject our common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for investors to sell shares at a price that is attractive to them.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and the trading price of our stock.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If we cannot maintain effective controls and reliable financial reports, our business and operating results could be harmed.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	For example, during the third quarter of 2013, our management determined that we had a material weakness related to the operation of our controls over financial reporting primarily associated with a complex non-routine financing transaction in the second quarter of 2013.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P41_S3	We continue to work on improvements to our internal controls over financial reporting and there can be no assurance that this or another material weakness will not occur in the future.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Any failure to implement and maintain controls over our financial reporting or difficulties encountered in the implementation of improvements in our controls, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.
908259_14_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Any failure to improve our internal controls over financial reporting or to address identified weaknesses in the future, if they were to occur, could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock.
908259_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	headquarters is located in South San Francisco, California where it leases 5,275 square feet of general office space.
908259_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	The lease as amended expires on June 30, 2014.
908259_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Company s common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol OXGN .
908259_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices of our common stock (rounded to the nearest penny) on The NASDAQ Global Market and The NASDAQ Capital Market, as applicable, as reported by NASDAQ, for each quarterly period during the two most recent fiscal years and subsequent interim periods.
908259_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	In December 2012, the Company s board of directors voted unanimously to implement a 1:12 reverse stock split of the Company s common stock, following authorization of the reverse split by a shareholder vote on December 21, 2012.
908259_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	The reverse split became effective on December 28, 2012.
908259_14_ITEM5_P1_S2	All of the per share sales prices shown in the table below have been adjusted to reflect the effect of these reverse splits.
908259_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	On March 17, 2014, the closing price of the Company s common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market was $4.26 per share.
908259_14_ITEM5_P2_S1	As of March 17, 2014, there were approximately 67 stockholders of record of the 15,236,069 outstanding shares of the Company s common stock.
908259_14_ITEM5_P2_S2	The Company believes, based on the number of proxy statements and related materials distributed in connection with its 2013 Special Meeting of Stockholders, that there are approximately 9,000 beneficial owners of its common stock.
908259_14_ITEM5_P2_S3	The Company has not declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock since its inception in 1988, and does not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
908259_14_ITEM5_P2_S4	The Company presently intends to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of its business.
908259_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	data with respect to the Company for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2013.
908259_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	The selected financial data for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2013 has been derived from the audited financial statements of the Company.
908259_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
908259_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or outcomes to be materially different from those anticipated and discussed herein.
908259_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	Important factors that we believe may cause such differences are discussed in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report and in the cautionary statements accompanying the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report.
908259_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	In assessing forward-looking statements contained herein, readers are urged to read carefully all Risk Factors and cautionary statements contained in this Annual Report.
908259_14_ITEM7_P0_S4	Further, we operate in an industry sector where securities prices are volatile and may be influenced by regulatory and other factors beyond our control.
908259_14_ITEM7_P0_S5	Since the fall of 2011, we have focused our capital resources on our most promising early-stage clinical programs with the goal of maximizing our highest value clinical assets while reducing our cash utilization.
908259_14_ITEM7_P0_S6	Accordingly, during 2013 our resources were focused on supporting our ovarian Phase 2 clinical trial which is being conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group, or GOG, our Phase 1 clinical trial in acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, being conducted by the University of Florida, our distribution agreement for the compassionate use of ZYBRESTAT in anaplastic thyroid cancer, or ATC, and the manufacture of clinical supply of our product candidates to support our programs and preclinical programs.
908259_14_ITEM7_P0_S7	In 2012 and earlier years, we also spent resources completing our ATC trial (FACT trial) and designing a Phase 3 registrational study in ATC (FACT 2 trial), and while we were successful in receiving a SPA with the FDA for the FACT 2 trial, we have subsequently determined that this trial is not financially feasible.
908259_14_ITEM7_P0_S8	We are now focusing our efforts in this area on pursuing the commercialization of ZYBRESTAT in Europe for the treatment of ATC with the filing of a potential marketing authorization under exceptional or conditional circumstances, and have devoted some of our resources to the manufacture of ZYBRESTAT for registrational lots required for this filing in Europe.
908259_14_ITEM7_P0_S9	In addition to the FACT trial, which was a Phase 2/3 trial that enrolled 80 patients, we had also previously undertaken a clinical trial in non-small cell lung cancer (FALCON), a 63-patient Phase 2 trial, as well as other, smaller studies in solid tumors, ovarian cancer and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.
908259_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	In February 2010, and in September 2011, we announced restructuring plans both designed to focus our resources on our highest-value clinical assets and reduce our cash utilization.
908259_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	As a part of these restructurings we stopped enrollment of additional patients in the FACT trial and each time reduced our work force.
908259_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	We have now concluded these clinical trials, which is the primary reason for the reduction in our expenses in 2013 and 2012 as compared to 2011.
908259_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are committed to a disciplined financial strategy and as such maintain a limited employee and facilities base, with development, scientific, finance and administrative functions, which include, among other things, product development, regulatory oversight and clinical testing.
908259_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our research and development team members typically work on a number of development projects concurrently.
908259_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	Accordingly, we do not separately track the costs for each of these research and development projects to enable separate disclosure of these costs on a project-by-project basis.
908259_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	We conduct scientific activities pursuant to collaborative arrangements with universities.
908259_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	Regulatory and clinical testing functions and drug manufacturing are generally contracted out to third-party, specialty organizations.
908259_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Financial Resources We have experienced net losses every year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2013, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $235,508,000.
908259_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	We expect to incur significant additional operating losses over at least the next several years, principally as a result of our plans to develop and commercialize ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of ovarian cancer, neuroendocrine tumors and potentially ATC in Europe, continuing and new clinical trials and anticipated research and development expenditures.
908259_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	The principal source of our working capital to date has been the proceeds of private and public equity financings and to a lesser extent the exercise of warrants and stock options.
908259_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	We currently have no recurring material amount of licensing or other income.
908259_14_ITEM7_P4_S4	As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately $7.0 million in cash.
908259_14_ITEM7_P4_S5	We also raised $12.0 million in gross proceeds, or approximately $11.1 million in net proceeds after deducting placement agents fees, and before deducting other offering expenses, in a public offering of common stock and warrants in February 2014, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements.
908259_14_ITEM7_P4_S6	Currently, we have two potential vehicles for raising additional capital.
908259_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	We have an at the market equity offering sales agreement, or the ATM Agreement, with MLV Co. LLC, or MLV, pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through MLV who will act as our sales agent and underwriter.
908259_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	We are limited as to how many shares we can sell under the ATM Agreement due to limitations imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on the number of shares issuable pursuant to a Form S-3 registration statement in a primary offering by smaller reporting companies such as us.
908259_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	We are also restricted from making sales under this agreement until November 2014 due to the securities purchase agreements we entered into for the financings completed in February 2014 and in September 2013.
908259_14_ITEM7_P5_S3	Subject to these restrictions, as of March 17, 2014 the total dollar amount of common stock that we could sell under the ATM Agreement during the next twelve months is approximately $264,000 under our current registration statement.
908259_14_ITEM7_P5_S4	We may be able to sell more shares under this agreement over the next twelve months depending on several factors including our stock price, the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as well as the timing of the occurrence of the sales.
908259_14_ITEM7_P5_S5	Additionally, subject to a minimum purchase price of $6.00 per share and other conditions of the arrangement, we may sell up to a total of $20,000,000 of our common stock to Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, or LPC, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement.
908259_14_ITEM7_P5_S6	The price of our common stock as of March 17, 2014 was $4.26 and therefore the facility is not available to us at this time.
908259_14_ITEM7_P5_S7	After our financing in February 2014, and subsequent exercises of warrants to purchase our common stock, based on our ongoing and planned new programs and operations, we expect our existing cash to support our operations through at least the end of 2015.
908259_14_ITEM7_P5_S8	We expect this level of cash utilization to allow us to continue our ongoing programs, including wrap up costs of completing the GOG 186I trial, initial startup costs of planning for a pivotal Phase 3 study in ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of advanced relapsed ovarian cancer, initiation of a clinical trial in a Phase 2 trial of ZYBRESTAT in neuroendocrine tumors, and, if we finalize an agreement with a non-profit collaborator, to initiate and share in the costs of a Phase 1b/2 trial of ZYBRESTAT in relapsed ovarian cancer in combination with Votrient .
908259_14_ITEM7_P5_S9	Any significant further development of ZYBRESTAT such as conducting pivotal Phase 3 studies in ovarian cancer or other capital intensive activities will be contingent upon our ability to raise additional capital in addition to our existing financing arrangements, as to which we can give you no assurance.
908259_14_ITEM7_P5_S10	We will require significant additional funding to fund operations and to continue the development of our product candidates.
908259_14_ITEM7_P5_S11	Such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
908259_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	or we could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations.
908259_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	Any additional equity financing, which may not be available to us or may not be available on favorable terms, most likely will be dilutive to our current stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	If we access funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own, on terms that are not favorable to us.
908259_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_14_ITEM7_P6_S4	Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
908259_14_ITEM7_P6_S5	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
908259_14_ITEM7_P6_S6	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to intangible assets.
908259_14_ITEM7_P6_S7	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
908259_14_ITEM7_P6_S8	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
908259_14_ITEM7_P6_S9	While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our Financial Statements included in this report, we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.
908259_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	License Agreements On August 2, 1999, we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development, manufacture, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by Arizona State University.
908259_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	The carrying value is being amortized over the term of the license (approximately 15.5 years).
908259_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	Management is required to perform an impairment analysis of its long-lived assets if triggering events occur.
908259_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	We review for such triggering events, including triggering events such as a going concern opinion and continuing operating losses, periodically.
908259_14_ITEM7_P7_S4	In addition, the agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals, which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones as defined in the agreement.
908259_14_ITEM7_P7_S5	We expense these payments to research and development in the period that payment becomes both probable and estimable.
908259_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Share-based compensation We record the expense recognition of the estimated fair value of all share-based payments issued to employees.
908259_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	The valuation of employee stock options is an inherently subjective process, since market values are generally not available for long-term, non-transferable employee stock options.
908259_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	Accordingly, an option pricing model is utilized to derive an estimated fair value.
908259_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	In calculating the estimated fair value of our stock options, we used the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires certain input assumptions.
908259_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	We estimate the expected term of options based on an analysis of historical behavior of participants over time.
908259_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	We determine the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term.
908259_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	We are required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
908259_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	Accordingly, we perform a historical analysis of option awards that are forfeited prior to vesting, and record total stock option expense that reflects this estimated forfeiture rate.
908259_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	In December 2011, we established a distribution agreement to provide access to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of patients with ATC in certain specified territories on a compassionate use basis.
908259_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	provides a regulatory mechanism to allow healthcare professionals in the specified territories to prescribe ZYBRESTAT to individual ATC patients while it is still in development.
908259_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	Our agreement provides that upon the receipt of ZYBRESTAT by the distributor for distribution and sale to compassionate use patients, the distributor has 30 days to inspect the product for defects and to ensure that the product conforms to the warranties made by us.
908259_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	If the distributor does not notify us of any defective product within the 30-day period it will be deemed to have accepted the product.
908259_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	Revenue is recognized based on product accepted at the conclusion of the 30-day inspection period.
908259_14_ITEM7_P13_S4	Also, the distributor will pay to us, on a quarterly basis, an amount equal to 20% of the distributor s gross margin, as defined in the agreement, on its sales of ZYBRESTAT in the preceding quarter, less the cost of introductory drug provided at no cost.
908259_14_ITEM7_P13_S5	This revenue will be recognized upon notification from the distributor of the gross margin earned.
908259_14_ITEM7_P13_S6	Currently, our drug is expensed as manufactured, since it is still in development.
908259_14_ITEM7_P13_S7	As a result, the product provided to the distributor has a zero cost basis, and therefore no cost-of-goods sold has been recorded.
908259_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Valuation of preferred stock and warrants In April 2013, we issued Series A Preferred Stock, Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants in a private placement.
908259_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	The Series A Preferred Stock issued in the offering had a beneficial conversion feature and, as a result, we recognized approximately $2.48 million as a non-cash deemed dividend.
908259_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	In order to calculate the amount of the deemed dividend, we estimated the relative fair value of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series A Warrants and the Series B Warrants issued in order to determine the amount of the beneficial conversion feature present in the Series A Preferred Stock.
908259_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Series A Preferred Stock was valued using Level 2 inputs by reference to the market value of our common stock into which the Series A Preferred Stock was convertible.
908259_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	The Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants granted were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model and the following Level 3 input assumptions:
908259_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	In September 2013, we issued Series B Preferred Stock and Warrants in a private placement and, using a portion of the proceeds of the private placement, redeemed the remaining outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued in April 2013.
908259_14_ITEM7_P15_S3	As a result of the redemption, the fair value of the consideration transferred to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and the carrying amount of the Series A Preferred Stock were treated as a non-cash deemed dividend to the shareholders of the Series B Preferred Stock.
908259_14_ITEM7_P15_S4	We recognized approximately $2.31 million as a non-cash deemed dividend.
908259_14_ITEM7_P15_S5	In order to calculate the amount of the deemed dividend, we calculated the amount of the consideration transferred to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock which included the estimated value of the Series B Preferred Stock and Warrants.
908259_14_ITEM7_P15_S6	The fair value of the Series B Preferred Stock was valued using Level 2 inputs by reference to the market value of the Company s common stock into which the Series B Preferred Stock is convertible.
908259_14_ITEM7_P15_S7	The fair values for the Warrants granted were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model and the following Level 3 input assumptions:
908259_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 Product revenues We recognized $95,000 in product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to $156,000 and $0 in the year ended December 31, 2012and 2011, respectively.
908259_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	Product revenue in 2013 and 2012 represents amounts recognized under our distribution agreement for the distribution and sale of ZYBRESTAT to compassionate use patients, which we entered into in December 2011.
908259_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	Revenues from our distribution agreement can vary from year to year depending on how much drug is sold on a compassionate use basis by our distributor.
908259_14_ITEM7_P16_S3	In both years, we recognized product revenues after delivery of ZYBRESTAT for compassionate use to the distributor and the 30 day inspection period had expired at which point the drug was deemed accepted.
908259_14_ITEM7_P16_S4	Additionally, in 2012, we recognized approximately $8,000 as revenue for 20% of the distributor s gross margin, as defined in the agreement, on its sales in the preceding quarter, after the distributor notified us of the amount.
908259_14_ITEM7_P16_S5	In 2014, we expect approximately the same range of revenue as 2013 and 2012, although there can be no assurance of this and at this time, we have no future firm orders from the distributor.
908259_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	ZYBRESTAT is expensed in the period it is manufactured because it is in the development stage and does not have an alternative future use.
908259_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	As a result, the product provided to the distributor had a zero cost basis, and therefore there is no cost-of-goods sold.
908259_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	Our future revenues will depend upon our ability to establish collaborations with respect to, and generate revenues from, products currently under development by us.
908259_14_ITEM7_P17_S3	We expect that we will not generate meaningful revenue in the near term future, unless and until we enter into new collaborations providing for funding through the payment of licensing fees and up-front payments.
908259_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Research and development expenses The table below summarizes the most significant components of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated, in thousands, and provides the amount and percentage change in these components: Research and development expenses increased in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, and decreased in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
908259_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	In 2013, the increase as compared to 2012 is primarily due to external services costs for the manufacturing of drug product for clinical use and potentially for the filing of a European Marketing Authorization application for ZYBRESTAT in ATC.
908259_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	In 2012, the decrease as compared to 2011 was primarily related to completing many clinical programs from the prior two to three years and focusing our efforts on our most promising early-stage programs including restructuring and reducing our staff to reflect the decreased level of activity.
908259_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	The clinical programs we completed included trials in our ZYBRESTAT for oncology program, including those we conducted in ATC and non-small cell lung cancer, and to a lesser extent clinical trials in our OXi4503 program and our ZYBRESTAT for ophthalmology programs.
908259_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	External services include manufacturing for our drug product for clinical use, manufacturing for our drug product required for regulatory filings, clinical research organizations, clinical site services, labs and many other outside services.
908259_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	the year ended December 31, 2012, is primarily attributable to costs associated with manufacturing our drug product primarily for activities associated with the potential filing of a European Marketing Authorization application for ZYBRESTAT in ATC.
908259_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	Such drug is expensed as manufactured and the associated cost can be impacted by the timing of when we need drug product for research and clinical trials and supplying drug for the EMA filing.
908259_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	The increase in manufacturing expenses in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, was offset in part by a decrease in external services due to the completion of the clinical trials as referenced above.
908259_14_ITEM7_P20_S3	The decrease in external services expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 is due primarily to costs associated with our previous clinical programs that have been completed or suspended, including those we conducted in ATC as referenced above.
908259_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	Employee compensation and related expenses include employee compensation, temporary help, employee benefits and travel.
908259_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	The reduction in employee compensation and related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, was due to a reduction in clinical employees and related employee costs due to delays in initiating new clinical trials.
908259_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	The reduction for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, was primarily due to the reduction of research and development programs as noted above and associated restructuring and reduction of staff for the decreased level of activity.
908259_14_ITEM7_P21_S3	Employee stock-based compensation expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011, respectively, due primarily to the reduction in headcount as described above; this amount can also vary significantly from period to period due to the timing and vesting of option grants.
908259_14_ITEM7_P21_S4	Other expenses include facility expenses and licensing fees and amortization.
908259_14_ITEM7_P21_S5	Other expenses have decreased in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to a reduction in facilities and related expenses.
908259_14_ITEM7_P21_S6	Other expenses increased in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 due primarily to a license fee we expensed in the 2012 year.
908259_14_ITEM7_P21_S7	Based on our business strategy as outlined in the business section above, we expect research and development expenses to increase in the year ending December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
908259_14_ITEM7_P21_S8	We have initiated and may continue to incur costs for drug manufacturing activities associated with the potential EMA filing for a European Marketing Authorization application for ZYBRESTAT in ATC.
908259_14_ITEM7_P21_S9	Additionally, we expect to incur costs associated with the initiation of our Phase 2 trial of ZYBRESTAT in patients with recurrent GI-NETs with elevated biomarkers, and, if we finalize an agreement with a non-profit collaborator, we expect to share in the costs of initiating a Phase 1b/2 trial of ZYBRESTAT in relapsed ovarian cancer in combination with Votrient .
908259_14_ITEM7_P21_S10	Therefore, research and development expenses are expected to increase in 2014 as compared to 2013.
908259_14_ITEM7_P21_S11	As of December 31, 2013, we have a balance of unapplied purchase orders for expenditures related to drug manufacturing activities of approximately $2,077,000, of which approximately $162,000 was estimated and accrued at December 31, 2013 for services performed, leaving approximately $1,345,000 to be incurred.
908259_14_ITEM7_P21_S12	Of the $1,345,000 amount to be incurred, we may incur approximately $1,260,000 over the next twelve months, of which approximately $570,000 is committed under non-cancelable contracts.
908259_14_ITEM7_P21_S13	Including the proceeds from our recent financing in February 2014 and subsequent exercises of warrants to purchase our common stock, we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents to support our operations through at least the end of 2015.
908259_14_ITEM7_P21_S14	We expect this level of cash utilization to allow us to continue our ongoing programs, including wrap up costs of completing the GOG 186I trial, initial startup costs of planning for a pivotal Phase 3 study in ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of advanced relapsed ovarian cancer, initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial of ZYBRESTAT in patients with recurrent GI-NETs with elevated biomarkers and, if we finalize an agreement with a non-profit collaborator, to initiate and share in the costs of a Phase 1b/2 trial of ZYBRESTAT in relapsed ovarian cancer in combination with Votrient .
908259_14_ITEM7_P21_S15	However, this level of cash utilization does not allow for any additional significant projects, including a pivotal clinical trial in ovarian cancers, to further the development of our most advanced product candidates.
908259_14_ITEM7_P21_S16	Any significant further development of ZYBRESTAT or other capital intensive activities will be contingent upon our ability to raise additional capital in addition to our existing financing arrangements.
908259_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	General and administrative expenses The table below summarizes the most significant components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated, in thousands, and the amount and percentage change in these components Employee compensation and related expenses decreased in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 due primarily to not incurring transition costs we incurred in 2012 of consolidating our Massachusetts administrative offices, including our finance employees, to our California headquarters.
908259_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	Employee compensation and related expenses decreased in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 due primarily to a restructuring and reduction in headcount in September 2011.
908259_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	Employee stock-based compensation expense increased in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 due primarily to a grant of restricted stock to an officer having a value of approximately $200,000.
908259_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	Employee stock-based compensation expense decreased in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, due in part to the reduction in headcount.
908259_14_ITEM7_P22_S4	This amount can also vary significantly from period to period due to the timing and vesting of option grants.
908259_14_ITEM7_P22_S5	Consulting and professional services expenses increased in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, due primarily to legal costs associated with financing efforts which were delayed and therefore expensed, and board compensation for increased membership, offset in part by lower consulting costs associated with investor relations and shareholder meeting costs.
908259_14_ITEM7_P22_S6	Consulting and professional services expenses increased in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, due to administrative, legal and investor relations costs, in part due to our reverse stock split, and board fees which increased due to a revised Board compensation policy.
908259_14_ITEM7_P22_S7	Other expenses decreased in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 as compared to the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, due primarily to a reduction in facility related costs, including insurance, due to the closing of our administrative offices in Massachusetts and the consolidation of our offices in South San Francisco into a smaller space.
908259_14_ITEM7_P22_S8	The decrease in other expenses was in part offset by an increase in Delaware franchise tax fees in the year ended December 31, 2011 due to an increase in the number of authorized shares.
908259_14_ITEM7_P22_S9	We continue to evaluate general and administrative expenses and look for ways to decrease such costs.
908259_14_ITEM7_P22_S10	As discussed above, we expect to begin new clinical trials and may incur increased manufacturing costs in the 2014 fiscal year, in which case general and administrative expenses could increase in support of research and development activities.
908259_14_ITEM7_P22_S11	As a result, general and administrative expenses in the future could vary significantly from those incurred in the 2013 fiscal year.
908259_14_ITEM7_P22_S12	Restructuring expenses We recorded a restructuring charge of $1,226,000 in the year ended December 31, 2011 and recorded net adjustments to the charge of $15,000 in the year ended December 31, 2012.
908259_14_ITEM7_P22_S13	This charge was a result of a restructuring plan announced on September 1, 2011, which included a reduction in work force, and was designed to focus our capital resources on our most promising early-stage clinical programs and further reduce our cash utilization.
908259_14_ITEM7_P22_S14	The restructuring was completed in 2012.
908259_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Other Income and Expenses The table below summarizes the components of Other Income and Expenses for the periods indicated, in thousands:
908259_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	We recorded an unrealized (non-cash) gain in the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 as a result of the change in the estimated fair market value of our common stock warrants issued in connection with private placements of shares of our common stock.
908259_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Investment income primarily reflects increases and decrease in cash balances due to interest earned on our operating cash accounts.
908259_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	The Other (expense) income amounts primarily reflect foreign exchange gains and losses which can vary depending on exchange rates agreements with foreign vendors and the timing of expenditures.
908259_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	The table below summarizes the components of the change in fair value of warrants for the periods indicated, in thousands:
908259_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Tax Matters At December 31, 2013, we had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $212,591,000 for U.S. income tax purposes, which will begin to expire for U.S. purposes in 2020.
908259_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	Due to the degree of uncertainty related to the ultimate use of these loss carry-forwards, we have fully reserved this future benefit.
908259_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	Additionally, the future utilization of the U.S. net operating loss carry-forwards is subject to limitations under the change in stock ownership rules of the Internal Revenue Service.
908259_14_ITEM7_P26_S3	The valuation allowance increased by approximately $2,642,000 from the year ended December 31, 2012 to the year ended December 31, 2013 and decreased by approximately $195,000 from the year ended December 31, 2011 to the year ended December 31, 2012.
908259_14_ITEM7_P26_S4	The increase between years 2012 and 2013 was due primarily to the increase in the federal net operating loss.
908259_14_ITEM7_P26_S5	The decrease between years 2011 and 2012 was due primarily to the decrease in Massachusetts research and development credit carry-forwards and decrease in Massachusetts net operating loss carry-forwards due to discontinued operations in the state.
908259_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES To date, we have financed our operations principally through net proceeds received from private and public equity financings and through a strategic development arrangement with Symphony Capital Partners, L.P., which concluded in 2009.
908259_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	We have experienced negative cash flow from operations each year since our inception, except in the year 2000.
908259_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	We expect to continue to incur increased expenses, resulting in losses, over at least the next several years due to, among other factors, our continuing and planned clinical trials and anticipated research and development activities.
908259_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	We had cash of approximately $7,005,000 at December 31, 2013 and, after our recent financing in February 2014, we had cash as of February 28, 2014 of approximately $16,204,000.
908259_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	Additionally in March 2014, warrants were exercised for the purchase of 3,767,592 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $9,279,000 through March 17, 2014.
908259_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated, in thousands:
908259_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	The net cash used in operating activities was $7,001,000 in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $8,335,000 in the comparable period in 2012.
908259_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	The net cash used in both periods was primarily attributable to the net losses, adjusted to exclude certain non-cash items, primarily stock based compensation.
908259_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	Net cash used in operating activities in the year 2013 was also impacted by an increase in accounts payable, primarily for expenses related to the manufacturing of ZYBRESTAT .
908259_14_ITEM7_P30_S3	Net cash used in operating activities in the year 2012 was also impacted significantly by the pay down of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, as many of our clinical trial programs were winding down.
908259_14_ITEM7_P30_S4	The net cash used in operating activities was $8,335,000 in the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $11,784,000 in the comparable period in 2011.
908259_14_ITEM7_P30_S5	The net cash used in both periods was primarily attributable to the net losses, adjusted to exclude certain non-cash items, primarily in the year 2011 from a change in the fair value of warrants and other financial instruments of $2,222,000.
908259_14_ITEM7_P30_S6	Net cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2012 was also impacted by the pay down of our accrued restructuring costs and for both the 2012 and 2011 year end periods by the reduction of accrued liabilities offset in part by non-cash stock-based compensation.
908259_14_ITEM7_P30_S7	Net cash provided by financing activities was $9,095,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $3,317,000 in the comparable period in 2012.
908259_14_ITEM7_P30_S8	Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the sale of preferred stock and warrants in private placements in April and September 2013, net of the redemption of a portion of the preferred stock issued in April 2013, and to a lesser extent from the sale of common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement, as discussed below.
908259_14_ITEM7_P30_S9	Additionally, in the year ended December 31, 2013, we received proceeds from the exercise of our Series B Warrants.
908259_14_ITEM7_P30_S10	Net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2012 was attributable to net proceeds from the sale of common stock pursuant to the LPC Purchase Agreement and ATM Agreement described below.
908259_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	On April 16, 2013, we closed an offering pursuant to the terms of a private placement agreement, in which we raised $5,000,000 in gross proceeds, before deducting placement agents fees and other offering expenses, in a private placement of 5,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock.
908259_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Subject to certain ownership limitations, shares of Series A Preferred Stock were convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, into an aggregate of up to 1,377,412 shares of our common stock.
908259_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	The Series A Preferred Stock was not redeemable or contingently redeemable, did not have a dividend right, nor did it have any preferences over our common stock, including liquidation rights.
908259_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2013, the investor in the private placement converted 2,198 shares of Series A Preferred Stock into 605,422 shares of our common stock.
908259_14_ITEM7_P32_S3	On September 23, 2013, we agreed to redeem 2,802 shares of Series A Preferred Stock that remained outstanding as of that date, which had a redemption value of approximately $2,802,000.
908259_14_ITEM7_P32_S4	Also included in the April 2013 offering were warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, as follows: (A) Series A Warrants to purchase 1,377,412 shares of our common stock, which were exercisable immediately after issuance, have a five-year term and a per share exercise price of $3.40; and (B) Series B Warrants to purchase 1,377,412 shares of our common stock, which were exercisable immediately after issuance, have a two-year term and a per share exercise price of $3.40.
908259_14_ITEM7_P32_S5	At the closing, we also issued to the placement agent and related persons Series A Warrants to purchase 82,645 shares of our common stock.
908259_14_ITEM7_P32_S6	The Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants contain limitations that prevent the holder of any warrants from acquiring shares upon exercise of a warrant that would result in the number of shares beneficially owned by it and its affiliates exceeding 9.99% of the total number of shares of our common stock then issued and outstanding.
908259_14_ITEM7_P32_S7	In addition, upon certain changes in control of our Company, the holder of Series A Warrants or Series B Warrants can elect to receive, subject to certain limitations and assumptions, securities in a successor entity equal to the value of the warrant, or if holders of common stock are given a choice of cash or property, then cash or property equal to the value of the outstanding warrants.
908259_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	In connection with the April 2013 private placement, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC on April 24, 2013, pursuant to the terms of a Registration Rights Agreement with the investors, to register the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and upon exercise of the Series A Warrants and the Series B Warrants.
908259_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	After deducting costs associated with the offering, the net proceeds of this offering were approximately $4,192,000.
908259_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	The Series A Preferred Stock contained a beneficial conversion feature and, as a result, we recognized approximately $2.48 million as a non-cash deemed dividend.
908259_14_ITEM7_P33_S3	On September 23, 2013, we closed on another offering pursuant to the terms of a private placement agreement, in which we raised $5,800,000 in gross proceeds, before deducting placement agents fees and other offering expenses, in a private placement of 5,800 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock.
908259_14_ITEM7_P33_S4	On September 23, 2013, we also agreed to redeem the remaining outstanding balance of the Series A Preferred Stock of 2,802 shares which had a redemption value of approximately $2,802,000.
908259_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	Subject to certain ownership limitations, shares of Series B Preferred Stock were convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, into an aggregate of up to 2,452,431 shares of our common stock.
908259_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	The Series B Preferred Stock was not redeemable or contingently redeemable, did not have a dividend right, nor did it have any preferences over the common stock, including liquidation rights.
908259_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	During year ended December 31, 2013, the investor in the private placement converted 5,800 shares of Series B Preferred Stock into 2,452,431 shares of our common stock.
908259_14_ITEM7_P34_S3	Also included in the offering were warrants to purchase 2,452,431 shares of our common stock, which were exercisable immediately after issuance, have a five-year term and a per share exercise price of $2.24.
908259_14_ITEM7_P34_S4	At the closing, we also issued to our placement agent and related persons warrants to purchase 147,145 shares of our common stock, which were exercisable immediately after issuance, have a five-year term and a per share exercise price of $2.80.
908259_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	The warrants contain limitations that prevent the holders of any warrants from acquiring shares upon exercise of warrants that would result in the number of shares beneficially owned by it and its affiliates exceeding 9.99% of the total number of shares of our common stock then issued and outstanding.
908259_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	In addition, upon certain changes in control of our Company, the holder of a warrant can elect to receive, subject to certain limitations and assumptions, securities in a successor entity equal to the value of the warrant or if holders of common stock are given a choice of cash or property, then cash or property equal to the value of the outstanding warrants.
908259_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	In connection with the September 2013 private placement, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 on October 2, 2013, pursuant to the terms of a Registration Rights Agreement with the investors, to register the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock and upon exercise of the warrants.
908259_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	We used the proceeds of the September 2013 offering in part to redeem the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued in April 2013 (see above).
908259_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	As a result of the redemption, we recognized approximately $2.31 million as a non-cash deemed dividend.
908259_14_ITEM7_P36_S3	After deducting costs associated with the offering, and deducting the amount to redeem the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the net proceeds of this offering were approximately $2,142,000.
908259_14_ITEM7_P36_S4	On February 18, 2014, we closed on a public offering of common stock and warrants, in which we raised approximately $11,106,000 in net proceeds, after deducting placement agents fees, and before other offering expenses.
908259_14_ITEM7_P36_S5	Investors purchased an aggregate of approximately $12 million of units, in a registered public offering, at a price per unit of $2.05.
908259_14_ITEM7_P36_S6	Each unit consisted of one share of common stock and 0.5 of a warrant to purchase a share of our common stock.
908259_14_ITEM7_P36_S7	A total of 5,853,657 shares of common stock were issued and warrants for the purchase of 2,926,829 shares of common stock were issued.
908259_14_ITEM7_P36_S8	The warrants are exercisable immediately after issuance, have a five-year term and an exercise price of $2.75 per share.
908259_14_ITEM7_P36_S9	Also, in connection with the offering, we issued to our placement agent and related persons warrants to purchase 292,682 shares of our common stock, which are exercisable 180 days after issuance, have a five-year term and an exercise price of $2.56 per share.
908259_14_ITEM7_P36_S10	The warrants contain limitations that prevent the holders of the warrants from acquiring shares upon exercise of the warrants that would result in the number of shares beneficially owned by it and its affiliates exceeding 9.99% of the total number of shares of our common stock then issued and outstanding.
908259_14_ITEM7_P36_S11	In addition, upon certain changes in control of our Company, the holder of a warrant can elect to receive, subject to certain limitations and assumptions, securities in a successor entity equal to the value of the warrant or if holders of common stock are given a choice of cash or property, then cash or property equal to the value of the outstanding warrants.
908259_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	On July 21, 2010, we entered into an at the market equity offering sales agreement, or ATM Agreement, with MLV Co. LLC or MLV, pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through MLV acting as our sales agent and underwriter.
908259_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	Sales of our common stock through MLV are made on the principal trading market of our common stock by means of ordinary brokers transactions at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by MLV and us.
908259_14_ITEM7_P37_S2	MLV uses its commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock from time to time, based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits we may impose).
908259_14_ITEM7_P37_S3	We pay MLV a commission rate of up to 7.0% of the gross sales price per share of any common stock sold through MLV as agent under the ATM Agreement.
908259_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	The Company is limited as to how many shares it can sell pursuant to the ATM Agreement due to SEC limitations on the number of shares issuable pursuant to a Form S-3 registration statement in a primary offering by smaller reporting companies such as the Company.
908259_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	As of March 7, 2014, the total dollar amount of common stock that the Company could sell under the ATM Agreement during the next twelve months is approximately $264,000 under its current registration statement.
908259_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	However, the Company is restricted by the terms of the securities purchase agreements that it entered into during 2013 and 2014 from making sales under this agreement until November 2014 .
908259_14_ITEM7_P38_S3	Subject to these restrictions, the Company may be able to sell more shares over the next twelve months under this agreement depending on several factors, including the Company s stock price, the number of shares of our common stock outstanding and the timing of the occurrence of the sales.
908259_14_ITEM7_P38_S4	In connection with the ATM Agreement, the Company issued 422,206 shares of common stock for proceeds of approximately $1,936,000 net of issuance costs, during the year ended December 31, 2013.
908259_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Company issued 178,000 shares of common stock in connection with the ATM Agreement for proceeds of approximately $1,270,000 net of issuance costs, during the year ended December 31, 2012.
908259_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	In November 2011, we entered into a purchase agreement, the LPC Purchase Agreement, for the sale, from time to time, of up to $20,000,000 of our common stock to Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC or LPC, a Chicago-based institutional investor.
908259_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	We do not have the ability to sell shares under this arrangement if we fail to maintain a minimum stock price of $6.00 or if we fail to maintain the effectiveness of a registration statement filed with the SEC.
908259_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	With this restriction and because the price of our common stock as of March 17, 2014 was $4.26, the facility is not available to us at this time.
908259_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	If our stock price rises above $6.00 and the other conditions of the arrangement are met, we could direct LPC to purchase up to $20,000,000 worth of shares of our common stock under our agreement over a 36-month period, in amounts of up to $200,000, which amounts may be increased under certain circumstances.
908259_14_ITEM7_P40_S4	During the 36-month term of the LPC Purchase Agreement, we generally control the timing and amount of any sales to LPC in accordance with the LPC Purchase Agreement.
908259_14_ITEM7_P40_S5	LPC has no right to require us to sell any shares to LPC, but LPC is obligated to make purchases as we direct, subject to certain conditions, which include the continuing effectiveness of a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering the resale of the shares that may be issued to LPC and limitations related to the market value of our common stock.
908259_14_ITEM7_P40_S6	There is no guarantee that funding from LPC will be available when needed, or at all.
908259_14_ITEM7_P40_S7	There are no upper limits to the price LPC may pay to purchase our common stock and the purchase price of the shares related to any future sales will be based on the prevailing market prices of our shares immediately preceding the notice of sale to LPC without any fixed discount.
908259_14_ITEM7_P40_S8	The LPC Purchase Agreement may be terminated by us at any time, at our sole discretion, without any cost or penalty.
908259_14_ITEM7_P40_S9	Assuming that the purchase price per share is $6.00 or greater, the total dollar amount of common stock that we could sell under the LPC Purchase Agreement during the next twelve months is approximately $17,400,000, provided that we would be required to file and have declared effective an additional registration statement in order to sell more than an additional 66,862 shares of our common stock under the LPC Purchase Agreement.
908259_14_ITEM7_P40_S10	In connection with the LPC Purchase Agreement, the Company issued 294,000 shares of common stock for proceeds of approximately $2,047,000, net of issuance costs, during the year ended December 31, 2012, including 6,493 shares issued as a commitment fee.
908259_14_ITEM7_P40_S11	No shares of common stock were issued under this agreement during the year ended December 31, 2013.
908259_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	In December 2011, we established a distribution agreement with a Danish company, which was expanded in August 2012, to provide access to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of patients in certain specified territories with ATC on a compassionate use basis.
908259_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	Our Named Patient Program, managed by the Danish company, provides a regulatory mechanism to allow healthcare professionals in the specified territories to prescribe ZYBRESTAT to individual ATC patients while it is still in development.
908259_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	Under the terms of the agreement, we provide ZYBRESTAT to the Danish company.
908259_14_ITEM7_P41_S3	The Danish company serves as exclusive distributor for ZYBRESTAT in the specified territories for this purpose and provides ZYBRESTAT to physicians solely to treat ATC on a compassionate use basis in the specified territories until such time as ZYBRESTAT may obtain marketing approval in that territory.
908259_14_ITEM7_P41_S4	The specified territories include the European Union, including the Nordic countries and Switzerland, Canada, Israel and South Korea, and the agreement may also be expanded to include other countries on a country-by-country basis.
908259_14_ITEM7_P41_S5	OXiGENE and the Danish company will cooperate on regulatory activities relating to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of ATC within the specified territories.
908259_14_ITEM7_P41_S6	There will be no transfer of ownership of intellectual property rights for ZYBRESTAT to the Danish company under the terms of the agreement.
908259_14_ITEM7_P41_S7	We do not expect to receive significant income from the Danish company under this arrangement.
908259_14_ITEM7_P41_S8	In the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $95,000 and $156,000, respectively of product revenue under this agreement.
908259_14_ITEM7_P41_S9	After our recent financing in February 2014 and subsequent exercises of warrants to purchase our common stock, based on our limited ongoing and planned new programs and operations, we expect our existing cash to support our operations through at least the end of 2015.
908259_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	Phase 1b/2 trial of ZYBRESTAT in relapsed ovarian cancer in combination with Votrient .
908259_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	However, it does not allow for any pivotal clinical trial of ZYBRESTAT in ovarian cancer.
908259_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	Any significant further development of ZYBRESTAT or other capital intensive activities will be contingent upon our ability to raise additional capital in addition to our existing financing arrangements.
908259_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	We will require significant additional funding to fund operations and to continue the development of our product candidates.
908259_14_ITEM7_P42_S4	Our ongoing capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including: the progress and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates under development, including ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503; the costs of complying with FDA and other regulatory agency requirements; the progress of our research and development programs; the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals; the resources, if any, that we devote to develop manufacturing methods and advanced technologies; our ability to enter into licensing arrangements, including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs; the costs and expenses of filing, prosecuting and, if necessary, enforcing our patent claims, or defending against possible claims of infringement by third-party patent or other technology rights; the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, if any, undertaken by us; and, if and when approved, the demand for our products, which demand depends in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known, understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval, including the range of indications for which any product is granted approval.
908259_14_ITEM7_P42_S5	If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we will not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we will be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs or cease operations.
908259_14_ITEM7_P42_S6	We may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements.
908259_14_ITEM7_P42_S7	Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	If we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish, on terms that are not favorable to us, rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize.
908259_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	Our failure to raise capital when needed will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	The following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2013 in thousands:
908259_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	Payments under clinical development and related commitments are based on the completion of activities as specified in the contract.
908259_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	The amounts in the table above assume the successful completion, by the third-party contractor, of all of the activities contemplated in the agreements.
908259_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Our primary drug development programs are based on a series of natural products called Combretastatins.
908259_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	In August 1999, we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by Arizona State University.
908259_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	This agreement was subsequently amended in June 2002.
908259_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	From the inception of the agreement through December 31, 2013, we have paid a total of $2,500,000 in connection with this license.
908259_14_ITEM7_P45_S4	The agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals, which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones, as defined in the agreement.
908259_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	certain additional compounds, as defined in the agreement.
908259_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	Future milestone payments under this agreement could total $200,000.
908259_14_ITEM7_P46_S2	We are also required to pay royalties on future net sales of products associated with these patent rights.
908259_14_ITEM7_P46_S3	We also have an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, for the commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including among others, ZYBRESTAT .
908259_14_ITEM7_P46_S4	Under the BMS license, we have the right to grant sublicenses.
908259_14_ITEM7_P46_S5	Under the license agreement, BMS is entitled to low-single-digit royalty payments for all commercial sales plus any remuneration OXiGENE receives for sale of ZYBRESTAT under named patient or compassionate use programs.
908259_14_ITEM7_P46_S6	All licensing fees and milestone payments under the license agreement, in the aggregate amount of $1,080,000, have been paid.
908259_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	We bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the BMS license and have a right, but not a duty, of enforcing patents covered by the license.
908259_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	Either party may terminate the license upon material default of the other party.
908259_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We have adopted an Investment Policy, the primary objectives of which are to preserve principal, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields while preserving principal.
908259_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Although our investments are subject to credit risk, we follow procedures to limit the amount of credit exposure in any single issue, issuer or type of investment.
908259_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase.
908259_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	However, due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration, we believe that interest rate risk is mitigated.
908259_14_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in U.S. dollar accounts.
908259_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Although we may from time to time manufacture drugs and conduct trials and studies outside of the United States, we believe our exposure to foreign currency risk to be immaterial.
908259_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and report on the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
908259_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of December 31, 2013, to ensure that we record, process, summarize and report the information we must disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
908259_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting In connection with our restatement of the results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2013, we identified deficiencies in the design and operation of controls related to the financial statement close process.
908259_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management determined that the Company did not maintain effective controls over the process for evaluating the accounting impact of complex non-routine financing transactions.
908259_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	sufficient analysis to determine whether or not the Series A Preferred Stock had a beneficial conversion feature that required measurement and recognition.
908259_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	We determined that this deficiency constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.
908259_14_ITEM9A_P2_S2	In the third quarter of 2013, we completed the remediation of controls related to the process for evaluating the impact of complex non-routine financing transactions.
908259_14_ITEM9A_P2_S3	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, identified in connection with the evaluation of such control that occurred during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
908259_14_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
908259_14_ITEM9A_P2_S5	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 Framework) (COSO).
908259_14_ITEM9A_P2_S6	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013.
908259_14_ITEM9A_P2_S7	This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
908259_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC.
908259_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud.
908259_14_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time.
908259_14_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.
908259_14_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Because we are not an accelerated filer, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, Ernst Young LLP was not required to issue an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting and, therefore, did not perform for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 an audit of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.

908259_14_ITEM15_P53_S0	Form 10-K Item 15(a)(1) OXiGENE, Inc.
908259_14_ITEM15_P54_S0	The following financial statements of OXiGENE, Inc. are included in Item 8:
908259_14_ITEM15_P55_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of OXiGENE, Inc.
908259_14_ITEM15_P55_S1	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of OXiGENE, Inc. as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related statements of comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013.
908259_14_ITEM15_P55_S2	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
908259_14_ITEM15_P55_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
908259_14_ITEM15_P55_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
908259_14_ITEM15_P55_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
908259_14_ITEM15_P55_S6	We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
908259_14_ITEM15_P55_S7	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
908259_14_ITEM15_P55_S8	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
908259_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
908259_14_ITEM15_P56_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
908259_14_ITEM15_P56_S2	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of OXiGENE, Inc. at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
908259_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	OXiGENE, INC. Notes to Financial Statements December 31, 2013 1.
908259_14_ITEM15_P57_S1	Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business OXiGENE, Inc. (the Company ), is incorporated in the state of Delaware, and is a clinical-stage, biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics primarily to treat cancer.
908259_14_ITEM15_P57_S2	The Company s major focus is developing vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) that selectively disrupt abnormal blood vessels associated with solid tumor progression.
908259_14_ITEM15_P57_S3	The Company is dedicated to leveraging its intellectual property and therapeutic development expertise to bring life-extending and life-enhancing medicines to patients.
908259_14_ITEM15_P57_S4	The Company has two VDA drug candidates currently being tested in clinical trials, ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503.
908259_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	Capital Resources In December 2012, the Company s board of directors voted unanimously to implement a 1:12 reverse stock split of the Company s common stock, following authorization of the reverse split by a shareholder vote on December 21, 2012.
908259_14_ITEM15_P58_S1	The reverse split became effective on December 28, 2012.
908259_14_ITEM15_P58_S2	All of the share and per share amounts discussed and shown in the financial statements and notes have been adjusted to reflect the effect of this reverse split.
908259_14_ITEM15_P59_S0	In February 2011, the Company s board of directors voted unanimously to implement a 1:20 reverse stock split of the Company s common stock, following authorization of the reverse split by a shareholder vote on December 21, 2010.
908259_14_ITEM15_P59_S1	The reverse split became effective on February 22, 2011.
908259_14_ITEM15_P59_S2	All of the share and per share amounts discussed and shown in the financial statements and notes have been adjusted to reflect the effect of this reverse split.
908259_14_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Company has experienced net losses every year since inception and, as of December 31, 2013, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $238,508,000.
908259_14_ITEM15_P60_S1	The Company expects to incur significant additional operating losses over at least the next several years, principally as a result of the Company s continuing clinical trials and anticipated research and development expenditures.
908259_14_ITEM15_P61_S0	The principal source of the Company s working capital to date has been the proceeds of private and public equity financings and to a lesser extent the exercise of warrants and stock options.
908259_14_ITEM15_P61_S1	The Company currently has no recurring material amount of licensing or other income.
908259_14_ITEM15_P61_S2	As of December 31, 2013, the Company had approximately $7.0 million in cash.
908259_14_ITEM15_P61_S3	The Company also raised $12.0 million in gross proceeds in a public offering of common stock and warrants in February 2014, as described in Note 11.
908259_14_ITEM15_P61_S4	After the recent financing in February 2014 and subsequent exercises of warrants to purchase our common stock, and based on the Company s limited ongoing programs and planned new programs and operations, the Company expects its existing cash to support its operations through at least the end of 2015.
908259_14_ITEM15_P61_S5	The Company expects this level of cash utilization to allow it to continue its ongoing programs, including wrap up costs of completing the GOG 186I trial, initial startup costs of planning for a pivotal Phase 3 study in ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of advanced relapsed ovarian cancer, initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial of ZYBRESTAT in patients with recurrent GI-NETs with elevated biomarkers and, if it finalizes an agreement with a non-profit collaborator, to initiate and share in the costs of a Phase 1b/2 trial of ZYBRESTAT in relapsed ovarian cancer in combination with Votrient .
908259_14_ITEM15_P61_S6	However it does not allow for a pivotal clinical trial of ZYBRESTAT in ovarian cancer.
908259_14_ITEM15_P61_S7	Any significant further development of ZYBRESTAT or other capital intensive activities will be contingent upon the Company s ability to raise additional capital in addition to its existing financing arrangements.
908259_14_ITEM15_P61_S8	Additional funding may not be available to OXiGENE on acceptable terms, or at all.
908259_14_ITEM15_P61_S9	If the Company is unable to access additional funds when needed, it may not be able to continue the development of its product candidates or the Company could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of its development programs and other operations.
908259_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	available on favorable terms, would most likely be dilutive to its current stockholders and debt financing, if available, and may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_14_ITEM15_P62_S1	If the Company accesses funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, it may be required to relinquish rights to some of its technologies or product candidates that it would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on its own, on terms that are not favorable to the Company.
908259_14_ITEM15_P62_S2	The Company s ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, will materially harm its business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_14_ITEM15_P63_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
908259_14_ITEM15_P63_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
908259_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk The Company has no significant off balance sheet concentrations of credit risk.
908259_14_ITEM15_P64_S1	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents.
908259_14_ITEM15_P64_S2	The Company holds its cash and cash equivalents at one financial institution.
908259_14_ITEM15_P64_S3	Cash and Restricted Cash The Company has $0 and $20,000 of restricted cash as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively that is used to secure financing through a Company credit card.
908259_14_ITEM15_P64_S4	This amount is classified apart from cash on the Balance Sheets.
908259_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	Fair Value The Company is required to disclose information on all assets and liabilities reported at fair value that enables an assessment of the inputs used in determining the reported fair values.
908259_14_ITEM15_P65_S1	Fair value hierarchy is now established that prioritizes valuation inputs based on the observable nature of those inputs.
908259_14_ITEM15_P65_S2	The fair value hierarchy applies only to the valuation inputs used in determining the reported fair value of the Company s investments and is not a measure of the investment credit quality.
908259_14_ITEM15_P65_S3	The hierarchy defines three levels of valuation inputs:
908259_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company did not hold any assets or liabilities subject to measurement on a recurring basis, except the derivative liabilities and other financial instruments discussed below in Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to and Potentially Settled in the Company s Common Stock which are valued using level 3 inputs.
908259_14_ITEM15_P66_S1	The Company was required to measure, on a non-recurring basis, the fair value of its convertible preferred stock and warrants issued in the April 2013 and September 2013 financing transactions.
908259_14_ITEM15_P66_S2	The methods and assumptions used to value those instruments is disclosed in Note 6 to the financial statements.
908259_14_ITEM15_P67_S0	Furniture and Fixtures, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements Furniture and fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost.
908259_14_ITEM15_P67_S1	Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years, or the applicable lease term.
908259_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	The carrying value of the license agreement with Arizona State University (ASU) is being amortized over the term of the agreement, which is approximately 15.5 years (see Note 3).
908259_14_ITEM15_P68_S1	The technology licensed from ASU is related to the Company s ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503 programs.
908259_14_ITEM15_P69_S0	The Company is required to perform an impairment analysis of its long-lived assets if triggering events occur.
908259_14_ITEM15_P69_S1	The Company reviews for such triggering events, such as a going concern opinion and continuing losses, periodically.
908259_14_ITEM15_P69_S2	Both the ZYBRESTAT and OXi4503 programs utilize intellectual property under the license agreement, demonstrating alternative future use in other research and development projects.
908259_14_ITEM15_P69_S3	The Company determined that there are no indicators of impairment of the asset as of December 31, 2013.
908259_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	The license agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals, which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones as defined in the agreement.
908259_14_ITEM15_P70_S1	The Company expenses these payments to research and development in the period the obligation becomes both probable and estimable.
908259_14_ITEM15_P71_S0	Accrued Research and Development The Company charges all research and development expenses, both internal and external costs, to operations as incurred.
908259_14_ITEM15_P71_S1	The Company s research and development costs represent expenses incurred from the engagement of outside professional service organizations, product manufacturers and consultants associated with the development of the Company s potential product candidates.
908259_14_ITEM15_P71_S2	The Company recognizes expenses associated with these arrangements based on the completion of activities as specified in the applicable contracts.
908259_14_ITEM15_P71_S3	Costs incurred under fixed-fee contracts are expensed ratably over the contract period absent any knowledge that the services will be performed other than ratably.
908259_14_ITEM15_P71_S4	Costs incurred under contracts with clinical trial sites and principal investigators are generally accrued on a patient-treated basis consistent with the terms outlined in the contract.
908259_14_ITEM15_P71_S5	In determining costs incurred on some of these programs, the Company takes into consideration a number of factors, including estimates and input provided by internal program managers.
908259_14_ITEM15_P71_S6	Upon termination of such contracts, the Company is normally only liable for costs incurred and committed to date.
908259_14_ITEM15_P71_S7	As a result, accrued research and development expenses represent the Company s reasonably estimated contractual liability to outside service providers at any particular point in time.
908259_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	In December 2011, the Company established a distribution agreement to provide access to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of patients with ATC in certain specified territories on a compassionate use basis.
908259_14_ITEM15_P72_S1	The agreement provides that upon the receipt of ZYBRESTAT by the distributor for distribution and sale to compassionate use patients, the distributor has 30 days to inspect the product for defects and to ensure that the product conforms to the warranties made by the Company.
908259_14_ITEM15_P72_S2	If the distributor does not notify the Company of any defective products within the 30-day period it will be deemed to have accepted the products.
908259_14_ITEM15_P72_S3	Revenue is recognized based on products accepted at the conclusion of the 30-day inspection period.
908259_14_ITEM15_P72_S4	Also, the distributor will pay to the Company, on a quarterly basis, an amount equal to 20% of the distributor s gross margin, as defined in the agreement, on its sales of ZYBRESTAT in the preceding quarter, less the cost of introductory drug provided at no cost.
908259_14_ITEM15_P72_S5	This revenue will be recognized upon notification from the distributor of the gross margin earned.
908259_14_ITEM15_P73_S0	ZYBRESTAT was expensed at the time it was manufactured, because it is in the development stage and there was not an alternative future use.
908259_14_ITEM15_P73_S1	As a result, the product provided to the distributor has a zero cost basis, and therefore no cost-of-goods-sold has been recorded.
908259_14_ITEM15_P74_S0	The Company s comprehensive loss consists of net loss and other comprehensive income (loss).
908259_14_ITEM15_P75_S0	Comprehensive income (loss) may include changes in the unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities.
908259_14_ITEM15_P75_S1	For the periods presented, there are no components of other comprehensive income or accumulated comprehensive income and net loss is equal to comprehensive loss.
908259_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	Stock-based Compensation The Company expenses the estimated fair value of all share-based payments issued to employees over the vesting period.
908259_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	The Company has a 2005 Stock Plan ( 2005 Plan ), which superseded its 1996 Stock Option Plan that provides for the award of stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights to employees, directors and consultants to the Company.
908259_14_ITEM15_P77_S1	The Company also has a 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( 2009 ESPP ) which was suspended in 2012.
908259_14_ITEM15_P78_S0	The Company has filed applications for patents in connection with technologies being developed.
908259_14_ITEM15_P78_S1	The patent applications and any patents issued as a result of these applications are important to the protection of the Company s technologies that may result from its research and development efforts.
908259_14_ITEM15_P79_S0	Costs associated with patent applications and maintaining patents are expensed as general and administrative expense as incurred.
908259_14_ITEM15_P79_S1	Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes based upon the provisions of ASC 740 Income Taxes.
908259_14_ITEM15_P79_S2	Under ASC 740, deferred taxes are recognized using the liability method whereby tax rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes based on when and how they are expected to affect the tax return.
908259_14_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company reviews all activity subsequent to year end but prior to the issuance of the financial statements for events that could require disclosure or which could impact the carrying value of assets or liabilities as of the balance sheet date.
908259_14_ITEM15_P81_S0	Furniture and Fixtures, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements Furniture and fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements consisted of the following at the dates indicated below (in thousands):
908259_14_ITEM15_P82_S0	License Agreements In August 1999, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement for the commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by Arizona State University.
908259_14_ITEM15_P82_S1	From the inception of the agreement through December 31, 2013, the Company has paid a total of $2,500,000 in connection with this license.
908259_14_ITEM15_P82_S2	The Company capitalized the net present value of the total amount paid under the initial terms of the license, or $1,500,000, and is amortizing this amount over the patent life or 15.5 years.
908259_14_ITEM15_P82_S3	The Company expects to record amortization expense related to this license agreement of approximately $7,800 per month through December 2014.
908259_14_ITEM15_P82_S4	The net book value at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $93,000 and $191,000 respectively.
908259_14_ITEM15_P83_S0	Restructuring On September 1, 2011, the Company announced a restructuring plan designed to focus the Company s capital resources on its most promising early-stage clinical programs and further reduce its cash utilization.
908259_14_ITEM15_P83_S1	In connection with this restructuring, the Company recognized approximately $721,000 of research and development restructuring expenses and approximately $505,000 of general and administrative restructuring expenses in the year ended December 31, 2011.
908259_14_ITEM15_P83_S2	In the year ended 2012, the Company made adjustments to the accrual of approximately $20,000 to increase the restructuring charge for general and administrative expenses and approximately $5,000 to decrease research and development expenses.
908259_14_ITEM15_P83_S3	The restructuring expenses include severance payments, health and medical benefits and related taxes.
908259_14_ITEM15_P83_S4	Activities under the 2011 restructuring plan were complete as of November 2012, therefore there were no further restructuring expenses recorded in the year ended December 31, 2013.
908259_14_ITEM15_P83_S5	The following table sets forth the components of the Company s restructuring for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):
908259_14_ITEM15_P84_S0	5. Accrued Other Accrued other consisted of the following at the dates indicated below (in thousands):

908259_14_ITEM15_P86_S0	Subject to certain ownership limitations, shares of Series A Preferred Stock were convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, into an aggregate of up to 1,377,412 shares of the Company s common stock.
908259_14_ITEM15_P86_S1	The Series A Preferred Stock was not redeemable or contingently redeemable, did not have a dividend right, nor did it have any preferences over the common stock, including liquidation rights.

908259_14_ITEM15_P110_S4	The difference between these items was recorded as a gain on the transaction of $690,000.
908259_14_ITEM15_P110_S5	On the date of the subsequent closing, the fair value of the Series E warrants was equal to the value of the 38,128 shares of common stock issued in the exchange, and therefore there was no gain or loss on this component of the transaction.
908259_14_ITEM15_P110_S6	The table below summarizes the factors used to determine the value of the Series A and C warrants outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2011.
908259_14_ITEM15_P111_S0	The Company established the fair value of the Series A and C warrants using the Black-Scholes option valuation model: Management determined the fair value of the Series E Warrants on the date of the initial closing to be $1,555,000.
908259_14_ITEM15_P111_S1	This fair value was estimated based upon the $48.00 per share fair value of the 38,128 shares of common stock expected to be exchanged for the Series E Warrants upon shareholder approval adjusted for a 15% discount for lack of marketability which existed until the expected shareholder vote.
908259_14_ITEM15_P111_S2	Management determined the fair value of the Series E warrants on the date of the subsequent closing to be $993,000.
908259_14_ITEM15_P111_S3	This fair value was estimated based upon the $26.04 per share fair value of the 38,128 shares of common stock exchanged for the Series E Warrants.
908259_14_ITEM15_P112_S0	Direct Registration Warrants On July 20, 2009, the Company raised approximately $10,000,000 in gross proceeds, before deducting placement agents fees and other offering expenses, in a registered direct offering (the Offering ) relating to the sale of 26,041 units, each unit consisting of (i) one share of common stock, (ii) a five-year warrant ( Direct Registration Series I ) to purchase 0.45 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $504.00 per share of common stock and (iii) a short-term warrant ( Direct Registration Series II ) to purchase 0.45 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $384.00 per share of common stock (the Units ).
908259_14_ITEM15_P112_S1	The short-term warrants expired on September 24, 2010 consistent with the terms of the warrant, without being exercised.
908259_14_ITEM15_P113_S0	The Company determined that the Direct Registration Series I warrants should be classified as a liability as they require delivery of registered shares of common stock and thus could require net-cash settlement in certain circumstances.
908259_14_ITEM15_P113_S1	Accordingly, these warrants were recorded as a liability at their fair value as of the date of their issuance and are revalued at each subsequent reporting date.
908259_14_ITEM15_P114_S0	The fair value of the direct registration warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation model applying the following assumptions: Committed Equity Financing Facility ( CEFF ) with Kingsbridge Capital Limited In February 2008, the Company entered into a Committed Equity Financing Facility ( CEFF ) with Kingsbridge Capital Limited ( Kingsbridge ), which was subsequently amended in February 2010 to increase the commitment period, increase the draw down discount price and increase the maximum draw period.
908259_14_ITEM15_P114_S1	Effective October 14, 2011, the CEFF was terminated by the Company.
908259_14_ITEM15_P114_S2	Under the terms of the amended CEFF, Kingsbridge committed to purchase, subject to certain conditions, up to 23,783 shares of the Company s common stock during the period ending May 15, 2012.
908259_14_ITEM15_P114_S3	While the CEFF was effective, the Company was able to draw down in tranches at discounts as described in detail in the common stock purchase agreement.
908259_14_ITEM15_P114_S4	In connection with the CEFF, the Company issued a warrant to Kingsbridge to purchase 1,041 shares of its common stock at a price of $657.60 per share exercisable beginning six months after February 19, 2008 and for a period of five years thereafter.
908259_14_ITEM15_P114_S5	The CEFF was terminated during 2011.
908259_14_ITEM15_P114_S6	As a result, shares of the Company s common stock are no longer available for sale under this facility.
908259_14_ITEM15_P115_S0	Due to the initially indeterminate number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants issued in connection with the Company s private placement on March 11, 2010, the Company concluded that the CEFF warrants should be recorded as a liability effective with the date of the private placement.
908259_14_ITEM15_P115_S1	The fair value of the warrants on this date was reclassified from equity to derivative liabilities.
908259_14_ITEM15_P115_S2	Changes in the fair market value from the date of the private placement to the reporting date were recorded as a gain or loss in Change in fair value of warrants in the Statements of Comprehensive Loss.
908259_14_ITEM15_P116_S0	Effective with the warrant exchange agreements executed in January 2011 as described above, the number of shares underlying the warrants issued in connection with the Company s private placement was no longer indeterminable, and the CEFF warrants were reclassified to equity.
908259_14_ITEM15_P117_S0	The Company revalued these warrants on the effective date of the exchange and recorded the gain in the Statements of Comprehensive Loss.
908259_14_ITEM15_P117_S1	The Company established the fair value of the CEFF warrants using the Black-Scholes option valuation model as reflected in the table below: Options and restricted stock The Company s 2005 Stock Plan, as amended at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in May 2012 (the 2005 Plan ) provides for the award of options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights to acquire up to 833,333 shares of the Company s common stock in the aggregate.
908259_14_ITEM15_P117_S2	Currently, the 2005 Plan allows for awards of up to 200,000 shares that may be granted to any one participant in any fiscal year.
908259_14_ITEM15_P117_S3	For options subject to graded vesting, the Company elected the straight-line method of expensing these awards over the service period.
908259_14_ITEM15_P117_S4	The following is a summary of the Company s stock option activity under its 2005 Plan for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013:
908259_14_ITEM15_P118_S0	As of December 31, 2013 there was approximately $95,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards that is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of approximately 2.61 years.
908259_14_ITEM15_P119_S0	The following stock options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:
908259_14_ITEM15_P119_S1	The fair values for the stock options granted were estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for the three years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:
908259_14_ITEM15_P120_S0	In calculating the estimated fair value of its stock options, the Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires the consideration of the following six variables for purposes of estimating fair value:
908259_14_ITEM15_P121_S0	the risk-free interest rate for the expected option term.
908259_14_ITEM15_P121_S1	The closing market price of its common stock on the date of grant.
908259_14_ITEM15_P122_S0	The expected term of options represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on an analysis of historical behavior of participants over time.
908259_14_ITEM15_P122_S1	The expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Company s stock price is expected to fluctuate during the term of the option granted.
908259_14_ITEM15_P122_S2	The Company determines the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of its common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term.
908259_14_ITEM15_P122_S3	Expected Dividends Because the Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on any of its common stock and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future, the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option.
908259_14_ITEM15_P123_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury issues with a remaining life consistent with the option s expected term on the date of grant.
908259_14_ITEM15_P123_S1	The Company is required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
908259_14_ITEM15_P124_S0	awards that are not yet vested, including awards granted prior to January 1, 2006.
908259_14_ITEM15_P124_S1	Accordingly, the Company performed a historical analysis of option awards that were forfeited prior to vesting, and ultimately recorded total stock option expense that reflected this estimated forfeiture rate.
908259_14_ITEM15_P124_S2	The Company recorded an expense of $259,913 during the year ended December 31, 2013 related to restricted stock awards granted from the Company s 2005 Stock Plan.
908259_14_ITEM15_P124_S3	16,769 shares granted to board of directors as board compensation were valued at $60,000, while 72,993 shares granted to an officer related to a restricted stock award were valued at $199,913.
908259_14_ITEM15_P124_S4	The restricted stock awards were valued based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the grant date and the shares were fully vested upon grant.
908259_14_ITEM15_P124_S5	In 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded expenses of $0 and $20,000 related to restricted stock awards.
908259_14_ITEM15_P124_S6	As of December 31, 2013, the Company did not have any non-vested restricted common stock outstanding.
908259_14_ITEM15_P124_S7	The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which was suspended in 2012.
908259_14_ITEM15_P124_S8	Under the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 2009 ESPP ), employees have the option to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at 85% of the closing price on the first day of each purchase period or the last day of each purchase period (as defined in the 2009 ESPP), whichever is lower, up to specified limits.
908259_14_ITEM15_P124_S9	Eligible employees are given the option to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, on a tax-favored basis, through regular payroll deductions in compliance with Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
908259_14_ITEM15_P124_S10	Currently, an aggregate of 10,417 shares of common stock may be issued under the 2009 ESPP, subject to adjustment each year pursuant to the terms of the 2009 ESPP.
908259_14_ITEM15_P125_S0	Basic and diluted net loss per share was calculated by dividing the net loss per share attributed to the Company s common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
908259_14_ITEM15_P125_S1	Diluted net loss per share includes the effect of all dilutive, potentially issuable common equivalent shares as defined using the treasury stock method.
908259_14_ITEM15_P125_S2	All of the Company s common stock equivalents are anti-dilutive due to the Company s net loss position for all periods presented.
908259_14_ITEM15_P125_S3	Accordingly, common stock equivalents of approximately 192,000, 143,000, and 83,000 stock options and 5,178,000, 13,000 and 13,000 warrants at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares for diluted net loss per share.
908259_14_ITEM15_P125_S4	The components of the Company s deferred tax assets at December 31, 2013 and 2012 are as follows: (Amounts in thousands):
908259_14_ITEM15_P126_S0	After consideration of the available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company has determined that a full valuation allowance at December 31, 2013 and 2012, is necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.
908259_14_ITEM15_P126_S1	The valuation allowance increased by approximately $2,642,000 and decreased by approximately $195,000 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
908259_14_ITEM15_P126_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2013, the increase was due primarily to the increase in the federal net operating loss.
908259_14_ITEM15_P126_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2012 the decrease was due primarily to the decrease in Massachusetts research and development credit carry-forwards and decrease in Massachusetts net operating loss carry-forwards due to discontinued operations in the state.
908259_14_ITEM15_P126_S4	At December 31, 2013, the Company had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $212,591,000 for U.S. income tax purposes, which will begin to expire in 2020 and state operating loss carry-forwards of $38,606,000 in California that will begin to expire in 2017.

908259_14_ITEM15_P126_S8	The future utilization of the net operating loss carry-forwards and credit carry-forwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership changes that could have occurred in the past or that may occur in the future under the provisions of IRC Section 382 or 383 of the internal revenue code.
908259_14_ITEM15_P127_S0	The Company provides for income taxes under the liability method in accordance with the FASB s guidance on accounting for income taxes.

908259_14_ITEM15_P130_S0	It is the Company s practice to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
908259_14_ITEM15_P130_S1	As of December 31, 2013 the Company has no accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

908259_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	We are a biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development of vascular disrupting agents, or VDAs, for the treatment of cancer.
908259_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	We have two clinical stage product candidates that are currently being developed in three potential oncology indications.
908259_15_ITEM1_P0_S2	Our lead compound, fosbretabulin tromethamine, or fosbretabulin, is being tested in two indications, recurrent ovarian cancer and gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors, or GI-NETs, and our second compound, OXi4503, is currently being tested in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
908259_15_ITEM1_P0_S3	We have been granted orphan drug designation for fosbretabulin in the treatment of ovarian cancer in the United States and the European Union, and for OXi4503 in the treatment of AML in the United States.
908259_15_ITEM1_P0_S4	To date, we have observed fosbretabulin to be well tolerated in over 450 patients and to have clinical activity in a variety of indications including ovarian cancer.
908259_15_ITEM1_P0_S5	We are pursuing what we believe to be a cost-efficient, risk-mitigated development strategy.
908259_15_ITEM1_P0_S6	In the United States and Europe, we are pursuing collaborations with established pharmaceutical companies with products whose efficacy we believe can be enhanced by the addition of our lead product candidate, fosbretabulin, and with non-profit research organizations such as The Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (UK), an international leader in cancer research and development, and the Gynecologic Oncology Group, or GOG, now part of NRG Oncology (NCI), an organization dedicated to clinical research in the field of gynecologic cancer, for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer.
908259_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	Fosbretabulin Development Program Fosbretabulin is a reversible tubulin binding agent that selectively targets the endothelial cells that make up the blood vessel walls in most solid tumors and causes them to swell, obstructing the flow of blood and starving the tumor of vital nutrients including oxygen.
908259_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	This deprivation, also known as tumor hypoxia, results in rapid downstream tumor cell death.
908259_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	Ovarian Cancer Ovarian cancer affects approximately 22,000 women in the U.S. each year.
908259_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	This form of cancer begins in the ovaries and often spreads to the rest of the pelvis and abdomen prior to detection, resulting in a relatively poor prognosis.
908259_15_ITEM1_P2_S2	In fact, more than 60% of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer are in stage III or IV, making ovarian cancer difficult to treat and often fatal, with a five-year survival rate of approximately 45% a rate which is largely unchanged since the 1990s.
908259_15_ITEM1_P2_S3	Overall, approximately 80% of patients diagnosed with ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer will relapse after first-line platinum-based and taxane-based chemotherapy.
908259_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	When treating recurrent ovarian cancer, the time between receiving the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy and disease recurrence is used to help determine the choice of chemotherapy used in the next line of treatment.
908259_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	Patients are said to have platinum-resistant disease if the disease worsens within six months of completing platinum-based chemotherapy.
908259_15_ITEM1_P3_S2	One quarter of those who relapse after initial treatment, or more than 4,300 women, will have platinum-resistant cancer, the most difficult-to-treat form of the disease.
908259_15_ITEM1_P3_S3	Additionally, a majority of patients who are not initially platinum-resistant and who may achieve a full remission following first-line therapy will also develop recurrent disease.
908259_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	There are relatively few cancer therapies that have been approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer including platinum-resistant cancer.
908259_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	Approved drugs include carboplatin and cisplatin, gemcitabine, doxorubicin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab.
908259_15_ITEM1_P4_S2	Many patients eventually become resistant to platinum-based therapies, and new treatment agents are needed.
908259_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Due to the unmet need in the treatment of ovarian cancer and the small patient size of the indication in terms of number of patients, we have been granted an orphan drug designation in both the U.S. and Europe for the use of fosbretabulin in the treatment of ovarian cancer.
908259_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Fosbretabulin in combination with AVASTIN (bevacizumab) Completed Phase 2 Trial Genentech / Roche s AVASTIN (bevacizumab) is an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, monoclonal antibody.
908259_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	We believe that using fosbretabulin in combination with AVASTIN (bevacizumab) may provide an equally effective yet potentially better tolerated alternative to the current standard of care, cytotoxic chemotherapy, for relapsed ovarian cancer.
908259_15_ITEM1_P6_S2	This belief is supported by the recently completed Phase 2 trial with this combination in recurrent ovarian cancer.
908259_15_ITEM1_P6_S3	In November 2014, the positive study results from the Phase 2 GOG-0186I clinical trial were presented at the 15th Biennial International Gynecologic Cancer Society (IGCS) conference in Melbourne, Australia.
908259_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	The GOG-0186I clinical trial was conducted by the GOG, now part of NRG Oncology, under the sponsorship of the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and was a randomized, two-arm Phase 2 trial evaluating AVASTIN (bevacizumab) alone, as compared to AVASTIN (bevacizumab) plus fosbretabulin, in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.
908259_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	The trial enrolled a total of 107 patients with both platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer at 67 clinical sites in the United States.
908259_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	The results indicated a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival (PFS) in the combination arm, which was the primary endpoint of the trial, with a p-value of 0.049 (pre-specified analysis using a one-sided test; 10% level of significance).
908259_15_ITEM1_P7_S3	The hazard ratio was 0.685, with a 90% 2-sided confidence interval (CI) of 0.47 ~1.00.
908259_15_ITEM1_P7_S4	Median PFS was 7.3 months for AVASTIN (bevacizumab) plus fosbretabulin (n=54), compared to 4.8 months with AVASTIN (bevacizumab) alone (n= 53).
908259_15_ITEM1_P7_S5	Patients in both arms were treated until disease progression or adverse effects prohibited further therapy.
908259_15_ITEM1_P7_S6	In a post-hoc subgroup analysis presented at the IGCS conference, data showed that patients who were platinum-resistant also had a statistically significant improvement in PFS with the combination.
908259_15_ITEM1_P7_S7	Among the 27 patients who were platinum-resistant, median PFS was 6.7 months for those receiving AVASTIN (bevacizumab) and fosbretabulin compared to 3.4 months for those receiving AVASTIN (bevacizumab) alone, with a p-value of 0.01.
908259_15_ITEM1_P7_S8	Although the subgroup included a relatively small number of patients, these findings suggest that adding fosbretabulin to AVASTIN (bevacizumab) has a potentially greater effect in this difficult-to-treat patient group than for platinum-sensitive patients.
908259_15_ITEM1_P7_S9	Also in the post-hoc subgroup analysis, while not statistically significant, among the 80 patients who were platinum-sensitive, median PFS was 7.6 months for those receiving AVASTIN (bevacizumab) and fosbretabulin compared to 6.1 months for those receiving AVASTIN (bevacizumab) alone, with a p-value of 0.139 and a hazard ratio of 0.67.
908259_15_ITEM1_P7_S10	In the study, patients with measurable disease who received the combination of fosbretabulin and AVASTIN (bevacizumab) also achieved a higher objective response rate, or ORR, a secondary endpoint in the study, measured according to RECIST criteria.
908259_15_ITEM1_P7_S11	Although not a statistically significant result, patients receiving the combination had an ORR of 35.7% (n=42; CI 90% 23.5 ~ 49.5%) compared to 28.2 percent for patients on AVASTIN (bevacizumab) alone (n=39; CI 90% 16.7 ~ 42.3%).
908259_15_ITEM1_P7_S12	In the small subgroup of platinum-resistant patients, the addition of fosbretabulin to AVASTIN (bevacizumab) treatment increased ORR to 40.0 percent (n=10) compared to 12.5 percent (n=8) for AVASTIN (bevacizumab) alone.
908259_15_ITEM1_P7_S13	Additional secondary endpoints in the study included safety and overall survival.
908259_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	All adverse events in the study were manageable, with one Grade 4 event occurring in each treatment arm.
908259_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	Consistent with prior clinical experience with fosbretabulin, patients in the combination arm experienced an increased incidence of Grade 3 hypertension compared to the control arm (10 cases for AVASTIN (bevacizumab) as compared to 17 for the combination).
908259_15_ITEM1_P8_S2	One patient on the combination regimen had a Grade 3 thromboembolic event.
908259_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	All cases of hypertension were managed with antihypertensive treatments, as specified in the study protocol.
908259_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	Patients continue to be followed for overall survival (OS).
908259_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	A preliminary analysis after 33 events did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in OS between the study arms.
908259_15_ITEM1_P9_S3	However, we believe that the OS data currently available is not sufficiently mature to yield any definitive conclusions.
908259_15_ITEM1_P9_S4	Further analysis of this secondary endpoint will be conducted as the data matures.
908259_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	AVASTIN (bevacizumab) is approved in the US in combination with chemotherapy (paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or topotecan) for the treatment of women with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer, based on results from the Phase III AURELIA trial, the approval of which was based on progression free survival.
908259_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	AVASTIN (bevacizumab) is also approved in the EU in combination with different chemotherapy regimens for platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, the approval of which was based on progression free survival.
908259_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	Our current clinical development plan in ovarian cancer is as follows: Fosbretabulin in combination with AVASTIN (bevacizumab) Potential Future Development In light of the results from the GOG-0186I trial, which demonstrated a prospectively defined statistically significant increase in progression-free survival from the combination of AVASTIN (bevacizumab) plus fosbretabulin as compared to AVASTIN (bevacizumab) alone, we are currently evaluating the potential development pathway, including the potential for a pivotal phase 3 clinical trial, for fosbretabulin in ovarian cancer.
908259_15_ITEM1_P11_S2	The subgroup analysis in platinum-resistant patients from the GOG-0186I trial suggests that adding fosbretabulin to AVASTIN (bevacizumab) has a potentially greater effect in this difficult-to-treat patient group than for platinum-sensitive patients, and therefore we currently plan to focus our potential development pathway on platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients.
908259_15_ITEM1_P11_S3	We are also conducting discussions regarding our development pathway in ovarian cancer with leading experts in this indication and anticipate discussions with regulatory agencies in the second quarter of 2015 to determine a possible path forward for fosbretabulin in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
908259_15_ITEM1_P11_S4	Depending on the feedback from the FDA, we may file a special protocol assessment (SPA) relating to the development of fosbretabulin in this indication during the third quarter of 2015.
908259_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	Fosbretabulin in combination with VOTRIENT (pazopanib) GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) s VOTRIENT (pazopanib) is an anti-angiogenic oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and soft tissue sarcoma (STS), with compelling early clinical data in the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer.
908259_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	We believe that using fosbretabulin in combination with VOTRIENT (pazopanib) may provide a clinically active yet potentially better tolerated alternative to the current standard of care, cytotoxic chemotherapy, for relapsed ovarian cancer.
908259_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	In October 2014, the first patient was enrolled in a Phase 1b/2 trial of VOTRIENT (pazopanib) with and without fosbretabulin, in advanced recurrent ovarian cancer.
908259_15_ITEM1_P12_S3	The study is sponsored by The Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and coordinated by the Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Trials Coordination Unit, or MAHSC-CTU, with additional support from The University of Manchester, the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and Mount Vernon Cancer Centre (part of the East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust).
908259_15_ITEM1_P12_S4	The trial design consists of a Phase 1b dose escalation portion with the combination of VOTRIENT (pazopanib) and fosbretabulin and a randomized Phase 2 portion comparing VOTRIENT (pazopanib) alone versus VOTRIENT (pazopanib) plus fosbretabulin in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer.
908259_15_ITEM1_P12_S5	The study is expected to enroll approximately 128 patients at sites in the U.K.
908259_15_ITEM1_P12_S6	The primary endpoint of the trial is progression-free survival, and secondary endpoints include safety, overall survival, objective response rate, and CA125 response rate.
908259_15_ITEM1_P12_S7	As in the combination therapy trial of fosbretabulin with AVASTIN (bevacizumab), which was sponsored and substantially funded by the National Cancer Institute, we believe that the cooperative relationship among the participants in this trial, with VOTRIENT (pazopanib) supplied by GSK and fosbretabulin supplied by us, will minimize our costs associated with this trial.
908259_15_ITEM1_P12_S8	We will incur limited costs as required by the U.K. s National Health Service (NHS) and the participating institutions for the duration of this trial and the costs of supplying fosbretabulin for the trial.
908259_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	The incidence of neuroendocrine tumors, or NETs, in 2004 in the US was approximately 5 per 100,000 people, indicating 14,000 new cases per year, and the incidence is increasing.
908259_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	Since patients with NETs can have prolonged survival rates of over 5 years, it is estimated that the prevalence is much higher, approximating 100,000 people in the US.
908259_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	The most common site of occurrence of NETs in the US population is in the gastrointestinal tract, with over half the tumors located at this site.
908259_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	These tumors can produce increased amounts of materials including peptides, many of which are biologically active and can, in around 10 -20% of patients, result in debilitating symptoms including flushing, diarrhea, weight loss and, less frequently, bronchoconstriction and heart failure.
908259_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	These particular symptoms are caused by overproduction of biologically active substances such as serotonin and kallikrein, which are released directly into systemic circulation, bypassing hepatic degradation.
908259_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	While drug treatment with somatostatin analogs, such as Sandostatin , helps to control the symptoms, patients who are or become unresponsive to somatostatin or its analogs have limited therapeutic options.
908259_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	It is our belief, based on the available preclinical data, that by reducing blood flow to the tumors using fosbretabulin, we may be able to reduce the production of tumor-derived materials, including these biologically active substances.
908259_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	Although our initial focus in NETs is on GI-NETs, we believe that if our clinical development in this area is successful, this approach may have utility in other NETs and other hormone-producing tumors.
908259_15_ITEM1_P16_S2	In September 2014, we enrolled the first patient in a Phase 2 monotherapy clinical trial of fosbretabulin in patients with GI-NETs with elevated biomarkers.
908259_15_ITEM1_P16_S3	This trial is designed to enroll 20 GI-NET patients with increased biomarker levels at five sites in the United States.
908259_15_ITEM1_P16_S4	The primary endpoint of the trial is a reduction in biomarkers and secondary endpoints include symptom control and changes in quality of life as assessed by validated measures.
908259_15_ITEM1_P16_S5	We estimate that the trial will complete enrollment by the end of 2015.
908259_15_ITEM1_P16_S6	We also believe that there is the potential to receive interim data from this clinical trial by the end of 2015.
908259_15_ITEM1_P16_S7	Patients who participate in this trial are eligible to enroll in a rollover clinical trial which is designed to treat patients for one year after they complete the Phase 2 clinical trial if they have responded to our drug.
908259_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Background A preclinical study of fosbretabulin in a transgenic mouse model of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, or PNETs, was presented at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, Boston, MA, in a poster session on October 20, 2013.
908259_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	This placebo-controlled preclinical study was designed to evaluate the activity of systemic administration of fosbretabulin for the treatment of functional insulinomas in a transgenic mouse model of PNETs.
908259_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	PNETs are highly vascularized tumors which originate in the pancreas.
908259_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	Functional PNETs make hormones that can cause a cascade of disease symptoms, resulting in significant morbidity for the patient.
908259_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	An insulinoma is a PNET that causes the over-secretion of the hormone insulin.
908259_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	The animals in the treatment group received fosbretabulin three times per week for four weeks, and the animals in the control group received a placebo at the same schedule.
908259_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	After four weeks, tumor size, serum insulin levels and other efficacy parameters, including apoptosis (cell death), cell proliferation and effects on tumor vasculature, were assessed.
908259_15_ITEM1_P19_S3	Treatment with fosbretabulin in this animal model resulted in a significant and sustained decrease in circulating insulin of more than 90% over four weeks of treatment with fosbretabulin.
908259_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	Treatment with fosbretabulin was not shown to be associated with any obvious toxicity, and was shown to disrupt tumor vasculature, induce apoptosis and inhibit tumor cell proliferation.
908259_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer, or ATC At this time our main focus with fosbretabulin is pursuing our programs in ovarian cancer and GI-NETs.
908259_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	While we have had discussions with the European regulatory agencies regarding the potential to submit a special marketing approval known as an MAA in the European Union for ATC under the exceptional circumstances pathway, and have received useful feedback, given our current priorities and resources, we have decided not to actively pursue such a filing at this time.
908259_15_ITEM1_P21_S2	Although this pathway continues to remain open to us, our near term priorities for fosbretabulin are focused on our development programs in ovarian cancer and completing our Phase 2 clinical trial in GI-NETs.
908259_15_ITEM1_P21_S3	In addition to pursuing development of fosbretabulin, we are also pursuing the development of a second product candidate, OXi4503, a novel, dual-mechanism VDA, which not only has been shown to reduce tumor blood flow but which also forms a potentially antiproliferative metabolite.
908259_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	We believe that this dual mechanism differentiates OXi4503 from other VDAs and may result in enhanced anti-tumor activity in certain tumor types as compared with other VDA drug candidates.
908259_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	Based on preclinical data, we believe that OXi4503 may be particularly active in hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, and leukemias of the myeloid lineage, all of which have relatively high levels of the enzymes that facilitate the conversion of OXi4503 into a chemical that directly kills tumor cells.
908259_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	Similar to fosbretabulin, OXi4503 has shown potent anti- tumor activity in preclinical studies of solid tumors and AML, and in two clinical studies in advanced solid tumors and liver tumors, both as a single agent and in combination with other antiproliferative agents.
908259_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	Our current development program for OXi4503 is as follows: Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, or AML AML is a relatively rare cancer of the myeloid blood cells, with approximately 10,500 new cases each year in the United States and accounting for approximately 1.2% of cancer deaths.
908259_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	AML is characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that pollute bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells.
908259_15_ITEM1_P24_S2	Due to an unmet need in the treatment of AML and the small size of the indication, we have been granted orphan drug designation in the United States for the use of OXi4503 in the treatment of AML.
908259_15_ITEM1_P24_S3	We intend to seek orphan drug designation in the EU.
908259_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	OXi4503 Investigator Sponsored Trial OXi4503 has been under development in an ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 1 trial of OXi4503 in patients with AML or MDS, a disorder of the normal blood formation process, being conducted at the University of Florida and with support by The Leukemia Lymphoma Society s Therapy Acceleration Program.
908259_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	This open-label, dose-escalating study was intended to treat up to 36 patients and evaluate the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose and biologic activity of OXi4503 in these patients.
908259_15_ITEM1_P25_S2	As of March 18, 2015, 16 patients have been enrolled into this study, and a maximum tolerated dose had not been observed.
908259_15_ITEM1_P25_S3	In an effort to increase enrollment at a faster rate, we are planning to close this trial and initiate our own sponsored clinical trial with additional sites as described below.
908259_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	In 2015 we intend to close the investigator sponsored Phase 1 trial of OXi4503 in patients with AML or MDS and initiate our own Phase 1/2 trial which will initially be an open-label, dose-escalating study intended to treat up to an additional 20 patients, at 3-6 sites and evaluate the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose and biologic activity of OXi4503 in these patients.
908259_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	Background Updated data from the investigator trial was presented at the December 2013 annual meeting of ASH in New Orleans, Louisiana.
908259_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Among the first 13 patients treated at the two lowest dose levels, two patients showed stable disease, one patient had a partial remission and one patient achieved a complete bone marrow response.
908259_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	Side effects included increases in D-dimer, which is a substance in the blood that is released when a blood clot breaks up, bone pain, fever, chills and flu-like symptoms.
908259_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	Accordingly, OXi4503 appears to be well tolerated based on these results to date in patients with relapsed and refractory AML and MDS.
908259_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	Biological activity associated with OXi4503 includes temporary increases in D-dimer which may be related to anti-leukemic activity of the drug.
908259_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	According to Cancer Research UK, a non-profit cancer research organization in the United Kingdom, nearly 90% of all cancers are solid tumors that are dependent upon a continually evolving vascular supply for their growth and survival.
908259_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	Similarly, in the ophthalmology field, abnormal neovascularization characterizes a variety of ophthalmological diseases and conditions, including wet age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, and diabetic retinopathy.
908259_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	Since 2004, a number of anti-angiogenic drugs, which refers to drugs that interfere with blood vessel growth, as described further in the table below, have been approved for a variety of cancer and ophthalmology indications, and development of approved anti-angiogenic drugs for new indications continues.
908259_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	Physician adoption of these first-generation anti-vascular drugs has been rapid and continues to accelerate.
908259_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	While fosbretabulin exerts a therapeutic effect similar to existing anti-angiogenic agents, depriving tumors (or, in the case of eye disease, ocular lesions) of blood supply, its mechanism of action is quite different.
908259_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	Consequently, we believe that our VDA drug candidates are second-generation anti-vascular drugs that are potentially complementary to, rather than directly competitive with, existing anti-angiogenic agents, a stance which is supported by the data we have gathered showing an improvement in patient outcomes when both agents are used in combination.
908259_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	Several preclinical studies, as well as the results of the Phase 2 GOG-0186I clinical trial, have confirmed the potential of this approach.
908259_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	As illustrated in the table below, VDA and anti-angiogenic drugs act via different mechanisms to produce complementary biological and anti-vascular effects with mostly non-overlapping side effects.
908259_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	In preclinical studies, VDA plus anti-angiogenic drug combinations demonstrate robust and additive anti-tumor effects.
908259_15_ITEM1_P35_S2	Results from initial human clinical studies conducted by us with combinations of fosbretabulin and AVASTIN (bevacizumab), provide support and initial clinical validation for combining these agents to significantly increase clinical activity without significantly increasing side-effects.
908259_15_ITEM1_P35_S3	Additionally, positive study results from the Phase 2 GOG-0186I clinical trial indicated a statistically significant increase in PFS with the combination of fosbretabulin and bevacizumab.
908259_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Chronic-chronic hypertension with long- term use; Acute- impairment in wound healing; Hemorrhage, hemoptysis, gastrointestinal perforation, proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, thromboembolic events, etc.
908259_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	Mostly hypertension, effectively controlled; Effects on hematopoiesis and white blood cell counts We believe our VDA drug candidates act on tumor blood vessels via two complementary mechanisms, tubulin depolymerization and disengagement of the junctional protein VE-cadherin, which cause shape change in tumor vascular endothelial cells, vessel occlusion and collapse, and the subsequent blockage of blood-flow to the tumor, which deprives it of oxygen and nutrients essential for survival.
908259_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	In vitro studies have demonstrated that our VDA drug candidates act in a reversible fashion on a protein called tubulin inside newly-formed and growing endothelial cells, such as the vascular endothelial cells comprising tumor vasculature.
908259_15_ITEM1_P37_S2	By binding to the tubulin, fosbretabulin is able to collapse the structural framework that maintains the cells flat shape.
908259_15_ITEM1_P37_S3	When this occurs, the shape of the cells changes from flat to round, initiating a cascade of events resulting in physical blockage of the blood vessels.
908259_15_ITEM1_P37_S4	The resulting shutdown in blood-flow then deprives tumor cells of the oxygen and nutrients necessary for maintenance and growth and also prevents tumor cells from being able to excrete toxic metabolic waste products.
908259_15_ITEM1_P37_S5	The consequence of the blockage is extensive tumor cell death, as demonstrated in animal studies and suggested in imaging studies of human patients treated with fosbretabulin and OXi4503.
908259_15_ITEM1_P37_S6	Preclinical research, published in the November 2005 issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation, showed that fosbretabulin also disrupts the molecular engagement of VE-cadherin, a junctional protein important for endothelial cell survival and function.
908259_15_ITEM1_P37_S7	The authors of the research article conclude that this effect only occurs in endothelial cells which lack contact with smooth muscle cells, a known feature of abnormal vasculature associated with tumors and other disease processes.
908259_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	The disengagement of VE-cadherin leads to endothelial cell detachment, which in turn, can cause permanent physical blockage of vessels.
908259_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	Preclinical and clinical study results indicate that fosbretabulin exerts anti-vascular effects rapidly, within hours of administration, and the half-life of the active form of fosbretabulin in humans is approximately four hours.
908259_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	Because the half-life of the active form of fosbretabulin is relatively short, the effects of fosbretabulin on tubulin are reversible, and fosbretabulin is typically administered no more frequently than once per week, the side-effects of fosbretabulin are typically transient in nature, limited to the period of time following administration when the active form of fosbretabulin is in the body in significant concentrations.
908259_15_ITEM1_P39_S2	This contrasts with drugs that interfere with blood vessel growth, known as anti-angiogenic agents, which are typically administered on a chronic basis so as to constantly maintain levels of drug in the body, exert their tumor blood-vessel growth inhibiting effects over days to weeks, and as a result can cause a variety of chronic side-effects that are not limited to the immediate period following administration.
908259_15_ITEM1_P39_S3	In contrast with anti-angiogenic agents, which can cause a variety of chronic side-effects, side-effects associated with fosbretabulin are typically transient and manageable.
908259_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	effects include infusion-related side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache and fatigue, and tumor pain, which is consistent with the drug s mechanism-of-action.
908259_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	Like approved anti-angiogenic drugs, fosbretabulin also exhibits cardiovascular effects, which in the majority of patients are mild and transient in nature.
908259_15_ITEM1_P40_S2	Approximately 10-20% of patients treated with fosbretabulin experience clinically-significant and transient hypertension that can be readily managed and prevented after initial occurrence with straightforward oral anti-hypertensive therapy.
908259_15_ITEM1_P40_S3	In an analysis undertaken by us, the incidence of serious cardiovascular side-effects such as angina and myocardial ischemia observed across all studies to date (including early studies in which hypertension management and prevention was not employed) was less than 3%, a frequency comparable to that reported with approved anti-angiogenic agents such as bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib.
908259_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our strategy is to develop innovative therapeutics for oncology.
908259_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	Our principal focus is to advance the clinical development and commercialization of our drug candidates fosbretabulin and OXi4503 and to identify new preclinical candidates that are complementary to our VDAs.
908259_15_ITEM1_P41_S2	To advance our strategy, we have established relationships with universities, research organizations and other institutions in these fields.
908259_15_ITEM1_P41_S3	We intend to continue to rely on these relationships, rather than expand our in-house research and development staff.
908259_15_ITEM1_P41_S4	In general, these programs are created, developed and controlled by our internal management.
908259_15_ITEM1_P41_S5	Currently, we have collaborative agreements and arrangements with a number of institutions in the United States and abroad, which we utilize to perform the day-to-day activities associated with drug development.
908259_15_ITEM1_P41_S6	In 2014, collaborations and agreements were ongoing with a variety of university and research institutions, including the following:
908259_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	In December 2011, we established a distribution agreement with a Danish company, Azanta Danmark A/S, or Azanta, to provide access to fosbretabulin for the treatment of patients with ATC on a compassionate use basis in certain specified territories, which was expanded to include additional territories in August 2012.
908259_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	This agreement was terminated effective December 31, 2014.
908259_15_ITEM1_P42_S2	The specified territories included the European Union, including the Nordic countries and Switzerland, Canada, Israel and South Korea.
908259_15_ITEM1_P42_S3	This program, which was managed by Azanta, provided a regulatory mechanism to allow healthcare professionals in the specified territories to prescribe fosbretabulin to individual ATC patients while it is still in development.
908259_15_ITEM1_P42_S4	Under the terms of the agreement, we provided fosbretabulin to the Danish company, and they served as our exclusive distributor for fosbretabulin in the specified territories for this purpose.
908259_15_ITEM1_P42_S5	The Danish company provided fosbretabulin to physicians solely to treat ATC on a compassionate use basis in the specified territories until such time as fosbretabulin may have obtained marketing approval in that territory.
908259_15_ITEM1_P42_S6	The Danish company was responsible for all regulatory activities necessary to distribute and sell fosbretabulin on a compassionate use basis for the treatment of ATC within the specified territories.
908259_15_ITEM1_P42_S7	There was no transfer of ownership of intellectual property rights for fosbretabulin to the Danish company under the terms of the agreement.
908259_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	We have secured a technology license from Arizona State University, or ASU.
908259_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	The ASU license is an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license for commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including among others, fosbretabulin and OXi4503.
908259_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	Combretastatins were originally isolated from the bark of the South African Bush Willow tree by researchers from Arizona State University but are now created by synthetic means and have tubulin-dependent anti-vascular and antiproliferative properties.
908259_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	Under the ASU license, we have the right to grant sublicenses.
908259_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	ASU is entitled to single-digit royalty and milestone payments under the license agreement.
908259_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	We bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the ASU license.
908259_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	Under the license agreement, we have agreed to diligently proceed with the development, manufacture and sale of products using the licensed technology.
908259_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	ASU has the first responsibility of enforcing patents under the license agreement.
908259_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	Either party may terminate the license agreement upon material default or bankruptcy of the other party.
908259_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	In addition, we may terminate the agreement by either (i) determining that filing for regulatory approval is not warranted by the clinical testing date or (ii) by providing two months written notice of our intent to terminate the agreement.
908259_15_ITEM1_P47_S3	Payments made to ASU to date have amounted to $2,600,000.
908259_15_ITEM1_P47_S4	The agreement remains in force until the expiration of the last to expire patent subject to the ASU license.
908259_15_ITEM1_P47_S5	Under a sponsored research agreement with Baylor University, we are pursuing discovery and development of additional novel, small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, including small-molecule cathepsin-L inhibitors and hypoxia-activated VDAs.
908259_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Cathepsin-L is an enzyme involved in protein degradation and has been shown to be closely involved in the processes of angiogenesis and metastasis.
908259_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	Small molecule inhibitors may have the potential to slow tumor growth and metastasis in a manner we believe could be complementary with our VDA therapeutics.
908259_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	We believe that our hypoxia-activated VDAs could serve as line-extension products to fosbretabulin and/or OXi4503.
908259_15_ITEM1_P49_S2	We also have an exclusive license from Baylor University to all novel compositions developed for the treatment of vascular disorders, inflammation, parasitic diseases and infections, fungal diseases and infections and/or cancer.
908259_15_ITEM1_P49_S3	We have the right to grant sublicenses under the Baylor license.
908259_15_ITEM1_P49_S4	The agreement with Baylor stipulates that low-single-digit royalties will be paid by us should sales be generated through use of Baylor s compounds.
908259_15_ITEM1_P49_S5	Further, commencing in the first year that we provide no research funding to Baylor University we must pay a minimum annual royalty payment of $40,000.
908259_15_ITEM1_P49_S6	We are not required to pay Baylor for use of Baylor s compounds other than pursuant to this royalty arrangement.
908259_15_ITEM1_P49_S7	We are entitled to file, prosecute and maintain patent applications on products for which we have a license under this agreement.
908259_15_ITEM1_P49_S8	We have made a one-time payment of $50,000 for the licensing fee that was used as a credit against research expenses generated by Baylor.
908259_15_ITEM1_P49_S9	Either party may terminate the license agreement upon material default of the other party.
908259_15_ITEM1_P49_S10	The term of the license shall end upon the expiration of the licensed patents.
908259_15_ITEM1_P49_S11	The latest U.S. patent licensed under this agreement is scheduled to expire in November 2030.
908259_15_ITEM1_P49_S12	We also have an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, for commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including among others, fosbretabulin.
908259_15_ITEM1_P49_S13	Under the BMS license, we have the right to grant sublicenses.
908259_15_ITEM1_P49_S14	Under the license agreement, BMS is entitled to low-single-digit royalty payments for all commercial sales plus any remuneration OXiGENE receives for sale of fosbretabulin under named patient or compassionate use programs.
908259_15_ITEM1_P49_S15	All licensing fees and milestone payments under the license agreement, in the aggregate amount of $1,080,000, have been paid.
908259_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	We bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the BMS license and have a right, but not a duty, of enforcing patents covered by the license.
908259_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	Either party may terminate the license upon material default of the other party.
908259_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	The term of the license shall end upon the expiration of the licensed patents.
908259_15_ITEM1_P50_S3	The latest United States patent licensed under this agreement is scheduled to expire in December 2021, excluding a patent term extension available under the Hatch-Waxman Act.
908259_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	In June 2012, we secured a royalty-bearing, transferable, worldwide, exclusive license from Angiogene Pharmaceuticals Ltd. to make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, and sell a vascular disrupting agent, such as fosbretabulin, for treating neuroendocrine tumors and associated symptoms and syndromes.
908259_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	Under the Angiogene license, we have the right to grant sublicenses.
908259_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	Angiogene is entitled to low single-digit royalty payments and milestone payments under the agreement.
908259_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	for a product using Angiogene intellectual property.
908259_15_ITEM1_P53_S1	We have the sole right to and bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the Angiogene license.
908259_15_ITEM1_P53_S2	Payments to Angiogene under this license to date have amounted to $300,000.
908259_15_ITEM1_P53_S3	The term of the royalty payable under the license will expire on the sooner of (i) ten years from the regulatory approval of a product subject to the license or (ii) launch by a third party of a generic version of the vascular disrupting agent.
908259_15_ITEM1_P53_S4	After the expiry of the royalty term, the license will become fully paid, irrevocable and perpetual.
908259_15_ITEM1_P53_S5	Either party may terminate the license upon material default of the other party, and we may terminate the agreement at will upon sixty days prior notice to Angiogene.
908259_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	We are a Delaware corporation, originally incorporated in 1988 in the state of New York and reincorporated in 1992 in the state of Delaware, with our principal corporate office in the United States at 701 Gateway Boulevard, Suite 210, South San Francisco, California 94080 (telephone: (650) 635-7000, fax: (650) 635-7001).
908259_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, are available to you free of charge through the Investors Media section of our web site as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
908259_15_ITEM1_P54_S2	Information contained on our web site does not form a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. REGULATORY MATTERS Government Regulation and Product Approval Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing.
908259_15_ITEM1_P54_S3	Our drugs must be approved by FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States.
908259_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations.
908259_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
908259_15_ITEM1_P55_S2	Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions.
908259_15_ITEM1_P55_S3	These sanctions could include the FDA s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusal of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties.
908259_15_ITEM1_P55_S4	Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
908259_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
908259_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA.
908259_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
908259_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development it enters the preclinical testing stage.
908259_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies.
908259_15_ITEM1_P58_S2	An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND.
908259_15_ITEM1_P58_S3	The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation.
908259_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	Preclinical testing continues even after the IND is submitted.
908259_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold.
908259_15_ITEM1_P59_S2	In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.
908259_15_ITEM1_P59_S3	Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
908259_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practice regulations.
908259_15_ITEM1_P60_S1	These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
908259_15_ITEM1_P60_S2	Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution.
908259_15_ITEM1_P60_S3	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
908259_15_ITEM1_P60_S4	The IRB also approves the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the study until completed.
908259_15_ITEM1_P60_S5	Each new clinical protocol must be submitted to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval.
908259_15_ITEM1_P60_S6	Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and efficacy in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.
908259_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
908259_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
908259_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
908259_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	Phase 2: Involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate preliminary efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
908259_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites.
908259_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling.
908259_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	During the development of a new drug, sponsors may, under certain circumstances request a special protocol assessment, or SPA, from the FDA.
908259_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	For example, a sponsor may request an SPA of a protocol for a clinical trial that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in an NDA.
908259_15_ITEM1_P65_S2	The request, which must be made prior to commencing the trial, must include the proposed protocol and protocol-specific questions that the sponsor would like the FDA to answer regarding the protocol design, study goals and data analysis for the proposed investigation.
908259_15_ITEM1_P65_S3	After receiving the request, the FDA will consider whether the submission is appropriate for an SPA.
908259_15_ITEM1_P65_S4	If an SPA is appropriate, the FDA will base its assessment on the questions posed by the sponsor.
908259_15_ITEM1_P65_S5	Comments from the FDA review team are supposed to be sent to the sponsor within 45 calendar days of receipt of the request.
908259_15_ITEM1_P65_S6	The sponsor may request a meeting to discuss the comments and any remaining issues and uncertainties regarding the protocol.
908259_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	agreement will be documented and made part of the administrative record.
908259_15_ITEM1_P66_S1	This agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins, except (1) with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or (2) if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began.
908259_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA.
908259_15_ITEM1_P67_S1	IND Safety Reports must be submitted to the FDA, IRBs and the investigators for (a) any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected; (b) any findings from epidemiological studies, pooled analysis of multiple studies, or clinical studies (other than those already reported in (a)); (c) any findings from animal or in vitro testing, whether or not conducted by the sponsor, that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug, such as reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure; and (d) any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
908259_15_ITEM1_P67_S2	Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
908259_15_ITEM1_P67_S3	The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
908259_15_ITEM1_P67_S4	Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
908259_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
908259_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug.
908259_15_ITEM1_P68_S2	Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
908259_15_ITEM1_P68_S3	The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product.
908259_15_ITEM1_P68_S4	The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances, which may include orphan drug status and the first NDA application for a company.
908259_15_ITEM1_P68_S5	In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective.
908259_15_ITEM1_P68_S6	The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
908259_15_ITEM1_P68_S7	Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
908259_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing.
908259_15_ITEM1_P69_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing.
908259_15_ITEM1_P69_S2	In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information.
908259_15_ITEM1_P69_S3	The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
908259_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
908259_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
908259_15_ITEM1_P70_S2	The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
908259_15_ITEM1_P70_S3	The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information.
908259_15_ITEM1_P70_S4	Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
908259_15_ITEM1_P70_S5	Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
908259_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA.
908259_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product s identity, strength, quality and purity.
908259_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.
908259_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	The FDA will also inspect selected clinical sites that participated in the clinical studies and may inspect the testing facilities that performed the GLP toxicology studies cited in the NDA.
908259_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	NDAs receive either standard or priority review.
908259_15_ITEM1_P74_S1	A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review.
908259_15_ITEM1_P74_S2	In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
908259_15_ITEM1_P74_S3	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials.
908259_15_ITEM1_P74_S4	Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process.
908259_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
908259_15_ITEM1_P75_S1	In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized.
908259_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	Orphan Drug Designation Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug.
908259_15_ITEM1_P76_S1	Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA.
908259_15_ITEM1_P76_S2	After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
908259_15_ITEM1_P76_S3	Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
908259_15_ITEM1_P76_S4	If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years.
908259_15_ITEM1_P76_S5	Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor s product for the same indication or disease.
908259_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	In the European Union and Japan, orphan drug exclusivity regulations provide for 10 years of marketing exclusivity for orphan drugs that are approved for the treatment of rare diseases or conditions.
908259_15_ITEM1_P77_S1	Fosbretabulin was awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of anaplastic, medullary, Stage IV papillary and Stage IV follicular thyroid cancers and ovarian cancer.
908259_15_ITEM1_P77_S2	OXi4503 was awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia.
908259_15_ITEM1_P77_S3	Fosbretabulin was also awarded orphan drug status by the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer and ovarian cancer.
908259_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	Expedited Review and Approval The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints.
908259_15_ITEM1_P79_S0	will not later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened.
908259_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments.
908259_15_ITEM1_P81_S0	Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied.
908259_15_ITEM1_P81_S1	Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review.
908259_15_ITEM1_P82_S0	Drugs that receive an accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect of a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
908259_15_ITEM1_P82_S1	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials.
908259_15_ITEM1_P83_S0	Foreign Regulation Before our products can be marketed outside of the United States, they are subject to regulatory approval similar to that required in the United States, although the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, including additional clinical trials that may be required, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country.
908259_15_ITEM1_P83_S1	No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country.
908259_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval.
908259_15_ITEM1_P84_S1	In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved.
908259_15_ITEM1_P84_S2	The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted.
908259_15_ITEM1_P84_S3	Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices may not be approved for such product.
908259_15_ITEM1_P85_S0	In Europe, marketing authorizations may be submitted through a centralized, a decentralized or mutual recognition procedure.
908259_15_ITEM1_P85_S1	The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all European Union members states.
908259_15_ITEM1_P85_S2	The centralized procedure is also mandatory for cancer indications and orphan drug products.
908259_15_ITEM1_P85_S3	Based on these requirements, the centralized procedure would be used for our two current product candidates, fosbretabulin and OXi4503.
908259_15_ITEM1_P86_S0	In Europe, alternative pathways for marketing approval include conditional approval or approval under exceptional circumstances.
908259_15_ITEM1_P86_S1	These pathways are available for drugs to treat serious or debilitating diseases and/or orphan drugs.
908259_15_ITEM1_P87_S0	Both conditional approval and approval under exceptional circumstances require a positive risk/benefit balance.
908259_15_ITEM1_P87_S1	Under conditional approval it is expected that additional clinical studies would support the lack of comprehensive clinical data provided at the time of the filing.
908259_15_ITEM1_P87_S2	Approval under exceptional circumstances is possible when the indication is so rare that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive clinical data.
908259_15_ITEM1_P87_S3	We have evaluated the potential benefits of seeking approval under exceptional circumstances for the use of fosbretabulin in ATC.
908259_15_ITEM1_P87_S4	However, given our current priorities and resources, we have decided not to actively pursue such a filing at this time.
908259_15_ITEM1_P87_S5	We actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including chemical species, compositions and forms, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, as well as modified forms of naturally-expressed receptors, in the United States and other jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets.
908259_15_ITEM1_P87_S6	We also rely upon trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information.
908259_15_ITEM1_P87_S7	As of March 18, 2015, we were the exclusive licensee, sole assignee or co-assignee of twenty-seven (27) granted U.S. patents, six (6) pending U.S. patent applications, and granted patents and/or pending applications in several other major markets, including the European Union, Canada and Japan.
908259_15_ITEM1_P87_S8	Our policy is to file U.S. and foreign patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business.
908259_15_ITEM1_P88_S0	patent applications will result in the grant of a patent either in the United States or elsewhere, or that any patents granted will be valid and enforceable, or will provide a competitive advantage or will afford protection against competitors with similar technologies.
908259_15_ITEM1_P88_S1	We also intend to rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel drugs.
908259_15_ITEM1_P88_S2	We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements.
908259_15_ITEM1_P88_S3	We consider the following U.S. patents and applications owned by or exclusively licensed to us to be particularly important to the protection of our most advanced product candidates.
908259_15_ITEM1_P89_S0	**** Patent filed, awaiting grant In addition to these patents, for some of our product candidates, we have patents and/or applications that cover a particular form or composition, use for a particular indication, use as part of combination therapy or method of preparation or use, as well as other pending patent applications.
908259_15_ITEM1_P89_S1	These issued patents, including any patents that issue from pending applications, could provide additional or a longer period of protection.
908259_15_ITEM1_P89_S2	We also have patent applications pending that seek equivalent or substantially comparable protection for our product candidates in jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets.
908259_15_ITEM1_P90_S0	The patent expiration dates referenced above do not reflect any potential patent term extension that we may receive under the federal Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
908259_15_ITEM1_P90_S1	The Hatch-Waxman Act generally permits a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
908259_15_ITEM1_P90_S2	Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years.
908259_15_ITEM1_P91_S0	The patent term restoration period is generally one-half of the time between the effective date of an investigational new drug application, or IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date and approval date of an NDA.
908259_15_ITEM1_P91_S1	Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent.
908259_15_ITEM1_P92_S0	The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for patent term extension.
908259_15_ITEM1_P93_S0	COMPETITION The industry in which we are engaged is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition.
908259_15_ITEM1_P93_S1	Our competitors include, among others, major pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, many of which have financial, technical and marketing resources significantly greater than ours.
908259_15_ITEM1_P93_S2	In addition, many of the small companies that compete with us have also formed collaborative relationships with large, established companies to support research, development, clinical trials and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours.
908259_15_ITEM1_P93_S3	Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or through joint ventures or other collaborations.
908259_15_ITEM1_P94_S0	We are aware of a limited number of companies involved in the development of VDAs.
908259_15_ITEM1_P94_S1	Such companies include Bionomics, Immune Pharmaceuticals, and MediciNova, all of which have VDAs that we believe are at an earlier or similar stage of clinical development than our lead drug candidate, fosbretabulin.
908259_15_ITEM1_P94_S2	We expect that, if any of our products gain regulatory approval for sale, they will compete primarily on the basis of product efficacy, safety, patient convenience, reliability, price and patent protection.
908259_15_ITEM1_P94_S3	Our competitive position will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop effective proprietary products and implement joint ventures or other alliances with large pharmaceutical companies in order to jointly market and manufacture our products.
908259_15_ITEM1_P94_S4	EMPLOYEES We expect to continue to maintain a relatively small number of executives and other employees.
908259_15_ITEM1_P94_S5	We rely on outsourcing for much of our research, development, preclinical testing and clinical trial activity, although we maintain managerial and quality control over our clinical trials.
908259_15_ITEM1_P94_S6	As of March 25, 2015, we had a total of 13 full-time employees and 1 employee working on a part-time basis.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Statements in this Annual Report under the captions Business and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as oral statements that may be made by us or by officers, directors or employees acting on our behalf, that are not historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from the historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors set forth below.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS We will be required to raise additional funds to finance our operations and continue the development of our product candidates; we may not be able to do so when necessary, and/or the terms of any financings may not be advantageous to us.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Negative cash flows from our operations are expected to continue over at least the next several years.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our cash utilization amount is highly dependent on the progress of our product development programs, particularly, the results of our preclinical and clinical studies and those of our partners, the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory approval for our product candidates, the terms and conditions of our contracts with service providers for these programs, and the rate of recruitment of patients in our human clinical trials.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P1_S5	In addition, the further development of our ongoing clinical trials will depend on upcoming analysis and results of those studies and our financial resources at that time.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P1_S6	We are pursuing forms of capital infusion including public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements with organizations that have capabilities and/or products that are complementary to our own capabilities and/or products, in order to continue the development of our product candidates.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P1_S7	However, there can be no assurances that we will complete any financings, strategic alliances or collaborative development agreements, and the terms of such arrangements may not be advantageous to us.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P1_S8	After our financing in March 2015, we expect our existing cash to support our operations through approximately the end of 2017.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P1_S9	We expect this level of cash utilization to allow us to advance our ongoing programs, including completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of fosbretabulin in patients with recurrent GI-NETs with elevated biomarkers including a rollover clinical trial designed to treat patients for one year after they complete the Phase 2 clinical trial if they have responded to fosbretabulin; the initiation and completion of the Phase 1 portion, and initiation of the Phase 2 portion, of an open-label clinical trial of OXi4503 in patients with AML to be sponsored by us; and supporting a Phase 1b/2 trial of fosbretabulin in relapsed ovarian cancer in combination with Votrient (pazopanib), being sponsored by two UK-based nonprofit organizations.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	existing cash will support the planning for a follow-on clinical program in fosbretabulin for the treatment of ovarian cancer, any significant further clinical development of fosbretabulin in advanced recurrent ovarian cancer, including the potential development of a special protocol assessment with the FDA, and conducting follow-on clinical studies or other capital intensive activities, will be contingent upon our ability to raise additional capital in addition to our existing financing arrangements or from a collaborative research agreement with a third-party, as to which we can give you no assurance.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our ongoing capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including: the progress and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates under development; the costs of complying with FDA and other regulatory agency requirements; the progress of our research and development programs and those of our partners; the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals; our ability to enter into licensing arrangements, including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs; the costs and expenses of filing, prosecuting and, if necessary, enforcing our patent claims, or defending against possible claims of infringement by third-party patent or other technology rights; the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, if any, undertaken by us; and, if and when approved, the demand for our products, which demand depends in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known, understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval, including the range of indications for which any product is granted approval.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	While we potentially have access to certain amounts of financing through an At Market Issuance Sales Arrangement, which we refer to as the ATM, with MLV Co.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	LLC, these arrangements alone will not be sufficient to fund a late-stage clinical trial of fosbretabulin in any indication.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	In addition, we may be restricted by the terms of financing arrangements that we may enter into from making sales under the ATM Agreement.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P2_S5	If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we will not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we will be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs or cease operations.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P2_S6	We may seek to raise funds through public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Any additional equity financing, whether through the ATM or otherwise, may be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish, on terms that are not favorable to us, rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our failure to raise capital when needed will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our ability to raise additional capital could also be impaired if our common shares lose their status on The NASDAQ Capital Market.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Due in part to our limited financial resources, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates or those that are in-licensed, and/or we may be unable to pursue the clinical trials that we would like to pursue.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P3_S4	We have limited technical, managerial and financial resources to determine the indications on which we should focus the development efforts related to our product candidates.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Due to our limited available financial resources, we have curtailed clinical development programs and activities that might otherwise have led to more rapid progress of our product candidates through the regulatory and development processes.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P3_S6	We may make incorrect determinations with regard to the indications and clinical trials on which to focus the available resources that we do have.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P3_S7	Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P3_S8	We or our partners currently are pursuing clinical trials in various indications, but we are required by our financial resources to engage only in limited clinical activities.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P3_S9	The decisions to allocate our research, management and financial resources toward particular indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P3_S10	Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate drug development programs may also cause us to miss valuable opportunities.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	candidates to supplement our internal development activities.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Those activities may use resources that otherwise would have been devoted to our internal programs.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We cannot assure you that any resources that we devote to acquired or in-licensed programs will result in any products that are superior to our internally developed products.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	If we are unable to obtain required regulatory approvals, we will be unable to market and sell our product candidates.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Our product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to development, clinical trials, manufacturing, oversight of clinical investigators, recordkeeping and commercialization.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory review and approval process are required to be successfully completed in the United States, in the European Union and in many other foreign jurisdictions before a new drug can be sold.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain, and subject to unanticipated delays.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P4_S7	The time required to obtain approval by the FDA or EMA is unpredictable and often exceeds five years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the complexity of the product candidate.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P4_S8	In connection with the clinical development of our product candidates, we face risks that:
908259_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	the results from clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance or clinical benefit-to-risk ratio required by the FDA, EMA or other regulatory agencies for marketing approval.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Only a small percentage of product candidates for which clinical trials are initiated are the subject of NDAs and even fewer receive approval for commercialization.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Furthermore, even if we do receive regulatory approval to market a product candidate, any such approval may be subject to limitations such as those on the indicated uses for which we may market the product.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	If we or the third parties on which we rely for the conduct of our clinical trials and results do not perform our clinical trial activities in accordance with good clinical practices and related regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We use independent clinical investigators and, in many cases, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct and/or oversee the clinical trials of our product candidates and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P5_S5	We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Nonetheless, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the FDA s requirements and our general investigational plan and protocol.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Currently, we have clinical trial activities involving fosbretabulin and OXi4503 being conducted by physician clinical investigators who are independent of us, but with whom we have agreements for them to provide the results of their clinical trials to us.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P5_S8	In order for us to rely on data from these ongoing studies in support of a marketing application, or NDA, for approval of any of our product candidates by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the independent investigators are required to comply with FDA requirements applicable to their studies.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or the respective trial plans and protocols.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates or result in enforcement action against us.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In February 2012, we were inspected by the FDA, and in March 2012, we received a Form FDA 483 containing observations from that inspection.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The Form FDA 483 noted observations of certain deficiencies in the conduct of our FACT trial in ATC, which was conducted from July 2007 February 2010.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	These observations related to the FDA s good clinical practice requirements and included the failure to insure proper monitoring of third-party clinical investigators who were participants in our FACT trial, the failure to promptly bring non-compliant clinical investigators into compliance, and also found that some of the clinical trial monitors selected by our clinical research organizations, or CROs, outside the United States were not sufficiently qualified by experience and training to monitor clinical trials.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	The Form FDA 483 also included observations related to the failure to address the improper storage of a drug that was being used in the trial, and the failure to maintain records and case histories in compliance with FDA regulations.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The issues noted in the Form FDA 483 had previously been identified and addressed by our management as part of an internal review of our systems, practices and procedures governing the areas of vendor oversight, quality, and regulatory compliance and were initially disclosed by us in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2009.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our response to the Form FDA 483 describes the corrective actions that we have taken and will continue to take in response to this matter.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	On February 10, 2014, we received correspondence from the FDA informing us that we appear to have taken corrective action to prevent the recurrence of the conditions that led to the issuance of the Form FDA 483 and that the related inspection is now closed.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	While we have taken and continue to take steps to strengthen our procedures in order to ensure that these issues will not recur in any future clinical trials sponsored by us for any of our product candidates, we cannot assure you that the FDA will be satisfied with our procedures, that the FDA will not issue a warning letter or take other enforcement action against us, or that similar issues will not recur in the future.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	In addition, the steps we take to strengthen our procedures and conduct future clinical trials necessary for approval will be time-consuming and expensive.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P8_S5	We may encounter difficulties in expanding our operations successfully if and when we evolve from a company that is primarily involved in clinical development to a company that is also involved in commercialization.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P8_S6	As we advance our product candidates through clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P8_S7	As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with such third parties, as well as additional collaborators, distributors, marketers and suppliers.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P8_S8	Maintaining third party relationships for these purposes will impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management and other personnel.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P8_S9	We must be able to: manage our development efforts effectively; manage our participation in the clinical trials in which our product candidates are involved effectively; and improve our managerial, development, operational and finance systems, all of which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P8_S10	If, following any approval of our product candidates, we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing or distribution services, any product revenues that we receive, or the profitability of these product revenues to us, are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P8_S11	In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our products or in doing so on terms that are favorable to us.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P8_S12	We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P8_S13	If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our products.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	If we were to file for a new drug application for our drug candidates in the United States or in the EU, we would need to undertake commercial scale manufacturing activities at significant expense to us in order to proceed with the application for approval for commercialization.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We or our external vendors may encounter technical difficulties that preclude us from successfully manufacturing the required registration and validation batches of active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and/or drug product and we may be unable to recover any financial losses associated with the manufacturing activities.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Further, our research or product development efforts may not be successfully completed, any compounds currently under development by us may not be successfully developed into drugs, any potential products may not receive regulatory approval on a timely basis, if at all, and competitors may develop and bring to market products or technologies that render our potential products obsolete.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If any of these problems occur, our business would be materially and adversely affected.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P9_S4	We have no manufacturing capacity and have relied on, and expect to continue to rely on, third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P9_S5	We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates or any of the compounds that we are testing in our preclinical programs, and we lack the resources and the capabilities to do so.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P9_S6	As a result, we currently rely, and we expect to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party manufacturers to supply our product candidates.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our product candidates or products ourselves, including:
908259_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	the possible termination or non-renewal of the manufacturing agreements by the third-party, at a time that is costly or inconvenient to us.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If we do not maintain our developed important manufacturing relationships, we may fail to find replacement manufacturers or develop our own manufacturing capabilities, which could delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products and substantially increase our costs or deplete profit margins, if any.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If we do find replacement manufacturers, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us, and there could be a substantial delay before new facilities could be qualified and registered with the FDA, EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The FDA, EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities require manufacturers to register manufacturing facilities.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The FDA and corresponding foreign regulators also inspect these facilities to confirm compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Contract manufacturers may face manufacturing or quality control problems causing drug substance production and shipment delays or a situation where the contractor may not be able to maintain compliance with the applicable cGMP requirements.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Any failure to comply with cGMP requirements or other FDA, EMA and comparable foreign regulatory requirements could adversely affect our clinical research activities and our ability to develop our product candidates and market our products after approval.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop our product candidates and commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely basis.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Our product candidates have not completed clinical trials, and may never demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in order to do so.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Our product candidates are in the clinical stage of development.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P11_S7	In order to achieve profitable operations, we alone or in collaboration with others, must successfully develop, manufacture, introduce and market our products.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P11_S8	The time frame necessary to achieve market success for any individual product is long and uncertain.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The products currently under development by us may require significant additional research and development and additional preclinical and clinical testing prior to application for commercial use.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	A number of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after showing promising results in early or later-stage studies or clinical trials.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Although we have obtained some favorable results to-date in preclinical studies and clinical trials of certain of our potential products, such results may not be indicative of results that will ultimately be obtained in or throughout such clinical trials, and clinical trials may not show any of our products to be safe or capable of producing a desired result.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Additionally, we may encounter problems in our clinical trials that may cause us to delay, suspend or terminate those clinical trials.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Our product candidates have been tested in over 450 patients to date, and adverse events associated with fosbretabulin and OXi4503 have been found to be mainly low grade, reversible, transient and manageable.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P13_S4	However, we will be required to continue to test and evaluate the safety of our product candidates in additional clinical trials, and to demonstrate their safety to the satisfaction of appropriate regulatory agencies, as a condition to receipt of any regulatory approvals.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In clinical trials to date, transient mild to moderate hypertension believed to be associated with fosbretabulin has been effectively managed through pre-treatment with antihypertensive medication.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to make the necessary demonstrations of safety to allow us to receive regulatory approval for our product candidates in any indication.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We only have a limited number of employees to manage and operate our business.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	As of March 25, 2015, we had a total of 13 full-time employees and 1 employee working on a part-time basis.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our focus on reducing cash utilization requires us to manage and operate our business in a highly efficient manner.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We have a history of losses, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We have experienced net losses every year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2014, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $251,155,000.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P15_S4	We anticipate continuing to incur substantial additional losses over at least the next several years due to, among other factors, our continuing clinical trials and development activities with respect to our VDA drug candidates, technologies, and anticipated research and development activities and the general and administrative expenses associated with those activities.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P15_S5	We have not yet commercialized any product candidates.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Our ability to attain profitability will depend upon our ability to develop and commercialize products that are effective and commercially viable, to obtain regulatory approval for the manufacture and sale of our products and to license or otherwise market our products successfully.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P15_S7	We may never achieve profitability, and even if we do, we may not be able to sustain being profitable.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P15_S8	We depend heavily on our executive officers, directors, and principal consultants and the loss of their services would materially harm our business.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P15_S9	We believe that our success depends, and will likely continue to depend, upon our ability to retain the services of our current executive officers, directors, principal consultants and others.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P15_S10	The loss of the services of any of these individuals would have a material adverse effect on our business.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P15_S11	In addition, we have established relationships with universities, hospitals and research institutions, which have historically provided, and continue to provide, us with access to research laboratories, clinical trials, facilities and patients.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P15_S12	Additionally, we believe that we may, at any time and from time to time, materially depend on the services of consultants and other unaffiliated third parties.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P15_S13	We cannot assure you that consultants and other unaffiliated third parties will provide the level of service to us that we require in order to achieve our business objectives.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P15_S14	Our industry is highly competitive, and our product candidates may become obsolete.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P15_S15	We are engaged in a rapidly evolving field.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P15_S16	Competition from other pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and research and academic institutions is intense and likely to increase.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P15_S17	Many of those companies and institutions have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	trials, obtaining regulatory approval and in manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for competitive products.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We are aware of at least three other companies that currently have a clinical-stage VDA for use in an oncology indication.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Some of these competitive products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing the desired therapeutic effect than products being developed by us.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Our competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective and/or cost competitive than those we are developing, or that would render our product candidates less competitive or even obsolete.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	In addition, one or more of our competitors may achieve product commercialization or patent protection earlier than we do, which could materially adversely affect us.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S4	We depend extensively on our patents and proprietary technology and the patents and proprietary technology we license from others, and we must protect those assets in order to preserve our business.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S5	We have licensed in rights to fosbretabulin, OXi4503 and other programs from third parties.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S6	If our license agreements terminate or expire, we may lose the licensed rights to our product candidates, including fosbretabulin and OXi4503, and we may not be able to continue to develop them or, if they are approved, market or commercialize them.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S7	We depend on license agreements with third-parties for certain intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates, including patent rights.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Currently, we have licensed in patent rights from Arizona State University, or ASU, and the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company for fosbretabulin and OXi4503 and from Baylor University and Angiogene Pharmaceuticals Ltd. for other programs.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S9	In general, our license agreements require us to make payments and satisfy performance obligations in order to keep these agreements in effect and retain our rights under them.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S10	These payment obligations can include upfront fees, maintenance fees, milestones, royalties, patent prosecution expenses, and other fees.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S11	These performance obligations typically include diligence obligations.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S12	If we fail to pay, be diligent or otherwise perform as required under our license agreements, we could lose the rights under the patents and other intellectual property rights covered by the agreements.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S13	While we are not currently aware of any dispute with any licensors under our material agreements with them, if disputes arise under any of our in-licenses, including our in-licenses from ASU, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Baylor University and Angiogene Pharmaceuticals Ltd., we could lose our rights under these agreements.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S14	Any such dispute may not be resolvable on favorable terms, or at all.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S15	Whether or not any disputes of this kind are favorably resolved, our management s time and attention and our other resources could be consumed by the need to attend to and seek to resolve these disputes and our business could be harmed by the emergence of such a dispute.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S16	If we lose our rights under these agreements, we may not be able to conduct any further activities with the product candidate or program that the license covered.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S17	If this were to happen, we might not be able to develop our product candidates further, or following regulatory approval, if any, we might be prohibited from marketing or commercializing them.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S18	In particular, patents previously licensed to us might after termination be used to stop us from conducting these activities.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S19	We depend extensively on our patents and proprietary technology, and we must protect those assets in order to preserve our business.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S20	Although we expect to seek patent protection for any compounds we discover and/or for any specific use we discover for new or previously known compounds, any or all of them may not be subject to effective patent protection.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S21	Further, the development of regimens for the administration of pharmaceuticals, which generally involve specifications for the frequency, timing and amount of dosages, has been, and we believe, may continue to be, important to our effort, although those processes, as such, may not be patentable.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S22	In addition, the issued patents may be declared invalid or our competitors may find ways to avoid the claims in the patents.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P18_S23	Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, protect our trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms like us is generally highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions, resulting in both an apparent inconsistency regarding the breadth of claims allowed in United States patents and general uncertainty as to their legal interpretation and enforceability.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Accordingly, patent applications assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not result in patents being issued, any issued patents assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not provide us with competitive protection or may be challenged by others, and the current or future granted patents of others may have an adverse effect on our ability to do business and achieve profitability.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Moreover, because some of the basic research relating to one or more of our patent applications and/or patents were performed at various universities and/or funded by grants, one or more universities, employees of such universities and/or grantors could assert that they have certain rights in such research and any resulting products.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Further, others may independently develop similar products, may duplicate our products, or may design around our patent rights.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P19_S4	In addition, as a result of the assertion of rights by a third-party or otherwise, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of others in or outside of the United States.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Any licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights may not be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P19_S6	If we do not obtain such licenses, we could encounter delays in product market introductions while our attempts to design around such patents or could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is foreclosed.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P19_S7	In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against us or in connection with patents to which we hold licenses or in bringing suit to protect our own patents against infringement.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P19_S8	We require employees and the institutions that perform our preclinical and clinical trials to enter into confidentiality agreements with us.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P19_S9	Those agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to a party to any such agreement during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third-parties, except in specific circumstances.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P19_S10	Any such agreement may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P19_S11	Our products may result in product liability exposure, and it is uncertain whether our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all claims.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P19_S12	The use of our product candidates in clinical trials and for commercial applications, if any, may expose us to liability claims, in the event such product candidates cause injury or disease, or result in adverse effects.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P19_S13	These claims could be made directly by health care institutions, contract laboratories, patients or others using such products.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P19_S14	Although we have obtained liability insurance coverage for our ongoing clinical trials, this coverage may not be in amounts sufficient to protect us from any product liability claims or product recalls which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P19_S15	Further, adverse product and similar liability claims could negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our technology and product candidates under development.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P19_S16	If clinical trials or regulatory approval processes for our product candidates are prolonged, delayed or suspended, we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis, which would require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any revenue from potential product sales.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P19_S17	We cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or any regulatory authority to delay or suspend those clinical trials or delay the analysis of data derived from them.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P19_S18	A number of events, including any of the following, could delay the completion of our other ongoing and planned clinical trials and negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and to market and sell, a particular product candidate:
908259_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	failure of our third-party contractors to comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise meet their contractual obligations to us.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed by the imposition of additional conditions on our clinical trials by the FDA, EMA or another foreign regulatory authority or the requirement of additional supportive studies by the FDA, EMA or another foreign regulatory authority.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, clinical trials require sufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the conduct of other clinical trials that compete for the same patients as our clinical trials, and the eligibility criteria for our clinical trials.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Our failure to enroll patients in our clinical trials could delay the completion of the clinical trial beyond our expectations.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In addition, the FDA and EMA could require us to conduct clinical trials with a larger number of subjects than we have projected for any of our product candidates.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P20_S5	We may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in a timely or cost-effective manner.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Furthermore, enrolled patients may drop out of our clinical trials, which could impair the validity or statistical significance of the clinical trials.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P20_S7	We do not know whether our clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured, or will be completed on schedule, if at all.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Delays in our clinical trials will result in increased development costs for our product candidates, and our financial resources may be insufficient to fund any incremental costs.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P20_S9	In addition, if our clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be limited.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P20_S10	Our product candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory review even if they receive marketing approval, and if we fail to comply with continuing regulations, we could lose these approvals and the sale of any approved commercial products could be suspended.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P20_S11	Even if we receive regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, and record keeping related to the product will remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P20_S12	If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA, EMA and other applicable domestic and foreign regulatory authorities or previously unknown problems with any approved product, manufacturer, or manufacturing process are discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:
908259_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	If physicians and patients do not accept our future products or if the market for indications for which any product candidate is approved is smaller than expected, we may be unable to generate significant revenue, if any.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Even if any of our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, and third-party payers.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Physicians may decide not to recommend our drugs for a variety of reasons including:
908259_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	ineffective marketing and distribution support of our products.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If any of our product candidates are approved, but fail to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenue and our business would suffer.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	The uncertainty associated with pharmaceutical reimbursement and related matters may adversely affect our business.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Market acceptance and sales of any one or more of our product candidates that we develop will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will cover and establish payment levels.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We cannot be certain that reimbursement will be available for any product candidates that we develop.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Also, we cannot be certain that reimbursement policies will not reduce the demand for, or the price paid for, our products.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If reimbursement is not available or is available on a limited basis, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidates that we develop.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The legislation established Medicare Part D, which expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drug purchases by the elderly but provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The United States and several foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P27_S3	We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any products that we develop due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, ACA, became law in the U.S.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	While we cannot predict what impact on federal reimbursement policies this legislation will have in general or on our business specifically, the ACA may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of, and the price we may charge for, any products we develop that receive regulatory approval.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We also cannot predict the impact of ACA on us as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions, which have not yet been fully implemented.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Our facility with MLV will not be sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements for all of our contemplated clinical trials.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	On July 21, 2010, we entered into an at the market equity offering sales agreement, or ATM Agreement, with MLV Co. LLC, or MLV, pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through MLV acting as our sales agent and underwriter.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Sales of our common stock through MLV are made on the principal trading market of our common stock by means of ordinary brokers transactions at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by MLV and us.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	MLV uses its commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock from time to time, based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits we may impose).
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S3	We pay MLV a commission rate of up to 7.0% of the gross sales price per share of any common stock sold through MLV as agent under the ATM Agreement.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S4	The amount that we could sell under the ATM Agreement may be limited as to how many shares we can sell under the ATM Agreement due to limitations imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on the number of shares issuable pursuant to a Form S-3 registration statement in a primary offering by smaller reporting companies such as us.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Additionally the amount we could sell may be limited depending on the price of our common stock and the shares outstanding, among other factors, to the extent it is available at all.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S6	The funding available from MLV may not be available when needed, or at all, depending on the market price of our common stock.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S7	The extent to which we rely on MLV as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors, including the prevailing market price of our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S8	If obtaining sufficient funding from MLV were to prove impracticable or prohibitively dilutive, we will need to secure another source of funding in order to satisfy our working capital needs.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S9	Even if we sell the maximum amount we are eligible to sell to MLV under the purchase agreement, we will still need additional capital to fully implement our business, operating and development plans.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S10	Should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S11	In addition, we are restricted for 90 days under the terms of our last financing which closed on March 25, 2015, and in the future we may be restricted by the terms of other financing arrangements that we may enter into from making sales under the ATM Agreement.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S12	Our restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law could deter a change of our management which could discourage or delay offers to acquire us.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S13	Certain provisions of Delaware law and of our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated by-laws, could discourage or make it more difficult to accomplish a proxy contest or other change in our management or the acquisition of control by a holder of a substantial amount of our voting stock.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S14	It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish, or could deter, transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interests or our best interests.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S15	The price of our common stock is volatile, and is likely to continue to fluctuate due to reasons beyond our control.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S16	The market price of our common stock has been, and likely will continue to be, highly volatile.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S17	Factors, including our financial results or our competitors financial results, clinical trial and research development announcements and government regulatory action affecting our potential products in both the United States and foreign countries, have had, and may continue to have, a significant effect on our results of operations and on the market price of our common stock.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S18	We cannot assure you that an investment in our common stock will not fluctuate significantly.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P30_S19	One or more of these factors could significantly harm our business and cause a decline in the price of our common stock in the public market.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants have been registered for resale or are available for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and may be sold from time to time.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Such sales, as well as future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders, or the perception that sales may occur at any time, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and the trading price of our stock.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	If we cannot maintain effective controls and reliable financial reports, our business and operating results could be harmed.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	For example, during the third quarter of 2013, our management determined that we had a material weakness related to the operation of our controls over financial reporting associated with a complex non-routine financing transaction in the second quarter of 2013.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P33_S3	We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 Framework) (COSO).
908259_15_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P33_S5	We continue to work on improvements to our internal controls over financial reporting and there can be no assurance that another material weakness will not occur in the future.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P33_S6	Any failure to implement and maintain controls over our financial reporting or difficulties encountered in the implementation of improvements in our controls, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P33_S7	Any failure to improve our internal controls over financial reporting or to address identified weaknesses in the future, if they were to occur, could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P33_S8	Issuance of additional equity securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P33_S9	We are currently authorized to issue 70,000,000 shares of our common stock.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P33_S10	As of March 25, 2015, we had 26,544,934 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, excluding shares issuable upon the exercise of our outstanding warrants and options, and we had no shares of preferred stock outstanding.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P33_S11	As of March 25, 2015, we also had 10,598,854 warrants and 689,431 options outstanding, of which 315,014 options are currently fully vested or vest within the next 60 days.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	To the extent that shares of common stock are issued or options and warrants are exercised, holders of our common stock will experience dilution.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	In addition, in the event of any future issuances of equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, holders of our common stock may experience dilution.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Moreover, our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Our board of directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, conversion rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or if we liquidate, dissolve or wind up our business and other terms.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P34_S4	If we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decrease.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Any provision permitting the conversion of any such preferred stock into our common stock could result in significant dilution to the holders of our common stock.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P34_S6	We also consider from time to time various strategic alternatives that could involve issuances of additional common stock, including but not limited to acquisitions and business combinations, but do not currently have any definitive plans to enter into any of these transactions.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P34_S7	We have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, and you may not receive funds without selling your common stock.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P34_S8	We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, nor do we expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	to pay cash dividends on our common stock at this time.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Any future determination to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, any contractual restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Accordingly, our investors may have to sell some or all of their common stock in order to generate cash from your investment.
908259_15_ITEM1A_P35_S3	You may not receive a gain on your investment when you sell our common stock and may lose the entire amount of your investment.
908259_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	The space will meet our needs for the foreseeable future.

908259_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	data with respect to the Company for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2014.
908259_15_ITEM6_P0_S1	The selected financial data for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2014 has been derived from the audited financial statements of the Company.
908259_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
908259_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or outcomes to be materially different from those anticipated and discussed herein.
908259_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	Important factors that we believe may cause such differences are discussed in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report and in the cautionary statements accompanying the forward- looking statements in this Annual Report.
908259_15_ITEM7_P0_S3	In assessing forward-looking statements contained herein, readers are urged to read carefully all Risk Factors and cautionary statements contained in this Annual Report.
908259_15_ITEM7_P0_S4	Further, we operate in an industry sector where securities prices are volatile and may be influenced by regulatory and other factors beyond our control.
908259_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are a biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development of vascular disrupting agents, or VDAs, for the treatment of cancer.
908259_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	We have two clinical stage product candidates that we are currently developing in three potential oncology indications.
908259_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	Our lead compound, fosbretabulin, is currently being tested in two indications, recurrent ovarian cancer and gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors, or GI-NETs, and our second compound, OXi4503, is currently being tested in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
908259_15_ITEM7_P1_S3	We have been granted orphan drug designation for fosbretabulin in the treatment of ovarian cancer in the United States and the European Union, and for OXi4503 in the treatment of AML in the United States.
908259_15_ITEM7_P1_S4	To date, we have observed fosbretabulin to be well tolerated in over 450 patients and to have clinical activity in a variety of indications including ovarian cancer.
908259_15_ITEM7_P1_S5	We are pursuing what we believe to be a cost-efficient, risk-mitigated development strategy.
908259_15_ITEM7_P1_S6	In the United States and Europe, we are pursuing collaborations with established pharmaceutical companies with products whose efficacy we believe can be enhanced by the addition of fosbretabulin, and with non-profit research organizations such as The Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, an international leader in cancer research and development, and the Gynecologic Oncology Group(GOG), now part of NRG Oncology, an organization dedicated to clinical research in the field of gynecologic cancer, for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer.
908259_15_ITEM7_P1_S7	During 2014 our resources were focused primarily on evaluating the potential clinical pathway for fosbretabulin in ovarian cancer after receiving positive study results in ovarian cancer from the Phase 2 clinical trial which was conducted by the GOG, the initiation of our Phase 2 clinical trial testing of fosbretabulin in GI-NETs, supporting the initiation of the Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in ovarian cancer being conducted by The Christie Hospital NHS Foundation comparing fosbretabulin in combination with pazopanib, and the manufacture of fosbretabulin for clinical supply and possibly to support any regulatory filings.
908259_15_ITEM7_P1_S8	We also continued to support our Phase 1 clinical trial testing OXi4503 in AML, being conducted by the University of Florida, and our distribution agreement for the compassionate use of fosbretabulin in ATC (which was terminated effective December 31, 2014).
908259_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	During 2013 and 2012 we focused our capital resources on our most promising early-stage clinical programs with the goal of maximizing our highest value clinical assets while reducing our cash utilization.
908259_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	our resources were focused on supporting our ovarian cancer Phase 2 clinical trial which was being conducted by the GOG, our Phase 1 clinical trial in AML, being conducted by the University of Florida, our distribution agreement for the compassionate use of fosbretabulin in ATC, and the manufacture of fosbretabulin for clinical supply and possibly to support any regulatory filings.
908259_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	In 2012 and earlier years, we also spent resources completing our ATC trial, or the FACT trial, and designing a Phase 3 registrational study in ATC, or the FACT 2 trial, and while we were successful in receiving a SPA with the FDA for the FACT 2 trial, we subsequently determined that this trial was not financially feasible.
908259_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	As a result, we explored the possibility with the European regulatory agencies regarding the potential to submit a special marketing approval, or MAA, in the European Union for ATC under the exceptional circumstances pathway, and while we received useful feedback, given our current priorities and resources, we decided in 2014 not to actively pursue such a filing at this time.
908259_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	We are committed to a disciplined financial strategy and as such maintain a limited employee and facilities base, with development, scientific, finance and administrative functions, which include, among other things, product development, regulatory oversight and clinical testing.
908259_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our research and development team members typically work on a number of development projects concurrently.
908259_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	Accordingly, we do not separately track the costs for each of these research and development projects to enable separate disclosure of these costs on a project-by-project basis.
908259_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	We conduct scientific activities pursuant to collaborative arrangements with universities.
908259_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Regulatory and clinical testing functions and drug manufacturing are generally contracted out to third-party, specialty organizations.
908259_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Financial Resources We have experienced net losses every year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2014, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $251,155,000.
908259_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	We expect to incur significant additional operating losses over the next several years, principally as a result of our plans to develop and commercialize fosbretabulin for the treatment of ovarian cancer and neuroendocrine tumors, and OXi4503 for the treatment of AML, continuing and new clinical trials and anticipated research and development expenditures.
908259_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	The principal source of our working capital to date has been the proceeds of private and public equity financings, the exercise of warrants and to a lesser extent the exercise of stock options.
908259_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	We currently have no recurring material amount of income.
908259_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $30,031,000 in cash.
908259_15_ITEM7_P7_S3	We also raised $10.0 million in gross proceeds, or approximately $9.35 million in net proceeds after deducting placement agents fees, and before deducting other offering expenses, in a registered direct offering of common stock and warrants in March 2015, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements.
908259_15_ITEM7_P7_S4	Currently, we have an at the market equity offering sales agreement, or the ATM Agreement, in place for raising additional capital.
908259_15_ITEM7_P7_S5	The ATM Agreement is with MLV Co. LLC, or MLV, pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through MLV who will act as our sales agent and underwriter.
908259_15_ITEM7_P7_S6	We are limited as to how many shares we can sell under the ATM Agreement due to limitations imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on the number of shares issuable pursuant to a Form S-3 registration statement in a primary offering by smaller reporting companies such as us.
908259_15_ITEM7_P7_S7	We may be able to sell more shares under this agreement depending on several factors including our stock price, the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as well as the timing of the occurrence of the sales.
908259_15_ITEM7_P7_S8	We will be required to file a new Form S-3 registration statement before June 14, 2015, as our current Form S-3 will be expiring on that date pursuant to SEC rules.
908259_15_ITEM7_P7_S9	After our financing in March 2015, we expect our existing cash to support our operations through approximately the end of 2017.
908259_15_ITEM7_P7_S10	We expect this level of cash utilization to allow us to advance our ongoing programs, including completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of fosbretabulin in patients with recurrent GI-NETs with elevated biomarkers including a rollover clinical trial designed to treat patients for one year after they complete the Phase 2 clinical trial if they have responded to fosbretabulin; the initiation and completion of the Phase 1 portion, and initiation of the Phase 2 portion, of an open label clinical trial of OXi4503 in patients with AML to be sponsored by us; and supporting a Phase 1b/2 trial of fosbretabulin in relapsed ovarian cancer in combination with Votrient (pazopanib) being sponsored by two UK-based nonprofit organizations.
908259_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	ovarian cancer, any significant further clinical development of fosbretabulin in advanced recurrent ovarian cancer, including the potential development of a special protocol assessment with the FDA, and conducting follow-on clinical studies or other capital intensive activities, will be contingent upon our ability to raise additional capital in addition to our existing financing arrangements or from a collaborative research agreement with a third-party, as to which we can give you no assurance.
908259_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	We will require significant additional funding to fund operations and to continue the development of our product candidates.
908259_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	Such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
908259_15_ITEM7_P8_S3	If we are unable to access additional funds when needed, we may not be able to continue the development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations.
908259_15_ITEM7_P8_S4	Any additional equity financing, which may not be available to us or may not be available on favorable terms, most likely will be dilutive to our current stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_15_ITEM7_P8_S5	If we access funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own, on terms that are not favorable to us.
908259_15_ITEM7_P8_S6	Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_15_ITEM7_P8_S7	Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
908259_15_ITEM7_P8_S8	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
908259_15_ITEM7_P8_S9	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to intangible assets.
908259_15_ITEM7_P8_S10	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
908259_15_ITEM7_P8_S11	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
908259_15_ITEM7_P8_S12	While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our Financial Statements included in this report, we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.
908259_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Share-based compensation We record the expense recognition of the estimated fair value of all share-based payments issued to employees.
908259_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	The valuation of employee stock options is an inherently subjective process, since market values are generally not available for long-term, non-transferable employee stock options.
908259_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	Accordingly, an option pricing model is utilized to derive an estimated fair value.
908259_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	In calculating the estimated fair value of our stock options, we used the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires certain input assumptions.
908259_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	We estimate the expected term of options based on an analysis of historical behavior of participants over time.
908259_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	We determine the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term.
908259_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	We are required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
908259_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	Accordingly, we perform a historical analysis of option awards that are forfeited prior to vesting, and record total stock option expense that reflects this estimated forfeiture rate.
908259_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	In December 2011, we established a distribution agreement to provide access to fosbretabulin for the treatment of patients with ATC in certain specified territories on a compassionate use basis.
908259_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	The agreement was terminated effective December 31, 2014.
908259_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our agreement provided that upon the receipt of fosbretabulin by the distributor for distribution and sale to compassionate use patients, the distributor had 30 days to inspect the product for defects and to ensure that the product conforms to the warranties made by us.
908259_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	If the distributor did not notify us of any defective product within the 30-day period it was deemed to have accepted the product.
908259_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	Revenue was recognized based on product accepted at the conclusion of the 30-day inspection period.
908259_15_ITEM7_P14_S3	Also, the distributor paid to us, on a quarterly basis, an amount equal to 20% of the distributor s gross margin, as defined in the agreement, on its sales of fosbretabulin in the preceding quarter, less the cost of introductory drug provided at no cost.
908259_15_ITEM7_P14_S4	This revenue was recognized upon notification from the distributor of the gross margin earned.
908259_15_ITEM7_P14_S5	Currently, our drug is expensed as manufactured, since it is still in development.
908259_15_ITEM7_P14_S6	As a result, the product provided to the distributor had a zero cost basis, and therefore no cost-of-goods sold has been recorded.
908259_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Valuation of preferred stock and warrants In April 2013, we issued Series A Preferred Stock, Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants in a private placement.
908259_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	The Series A Preferred Stock issued in the offering had a beneficial conversion feature and, as a result, we recognized approximately $2.48 million as a non-cash deemed dividend.
908259_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	In order to calculate the amount of the deemed dividend, we estimated the relative fair value of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series A Warrants and the Series B Warrants issued in order to determine the amount of the beneficial conversion feature present in the Series A Preferred Stock.
908259_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	The Series A Preferred Stock was valued using Level 2 inputs by reference to the market value of our common stock into which the Series A Preferred Stock was convertible.
908259_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	The Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants granted were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model and the following Level 3 input assumptions:
908259_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	In September 2013, we issued Series B Preferred Stock and Warrants in a private placement and, using a portion of the proceeds of the private placement, redeemed the remaining outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued in April 2013.
908259_15_ITEM7_P16_S3	As a result of the redemption, the fair value of the consideration transferred to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and the carrying amount of the Series A Preferred Stock were treated as a non-cash deemed dividend to the shareholders of the Series B Preferred Stock.
908259_15_ITEM7_P16_S4	We recognized approximately $2.31 million as a non-cash deemed dividend.
908259_15_ITEM7_P16_S5	In order to calculate the amount of the deemed dividend, we calculated the amount of the consideration transferred to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock which included the estimated value of the Series B Preferred Stock and Warrants.
908259_15_ITEM7_P16_S6	The fair value of the Series B Preferred Stock was valued using Level 2 inputs by reference to the market value of the Company s common stock into which the Series B Preferred Stock is convertible.
908259_15_ITEM7_P16_S7	The fair values for the Warrants granted were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model and the following Level 3 input assumptions:
908259_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 Product revenues We did not recognize any product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $95,000 and $156,000 in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
908259_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	Product revenues in 2013 and 2012 represent amounts recognized under our distribution agreement with a Danish company which we entered into in December 2011.
908259_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	Product revenues were recognized after delivery of fosbretabulin to the Danish company and the expiration of the 30 day inspection period had expired at which point the drug was deemed accepted.
908259_15_ITEM7_P17_S3	Additionally, in 2012, we recognized approximately $8,000 as revenue for 20% of the distributor s gross margin, as defined in the agreement, on its sales in the preceding quarter, after the distributor notified us of the amount.
908259_15_ITEM7_P17_S4	The agreement was terminated effective December 31, 2014.
908259_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Research and development expenses The table below summarizes the most significant components of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated, in thousands, and provides the amount and percentage change in these components: Research and development expenses increased in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 as compared to the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
908259_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	In 2014, the increase as compared to 2013 is primarily due to external services costs related to the GI-NET Phase 2 clinical trial that was initiated in 2014 and for the manufacturing of drug product primarily for clinical use and potentially to support any regulatory filings.
908259_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	In 2013, the increase as compared to 2012 is primarily due to external services costs for the manufacturing of drug product for clinical use and potentially to support any regulatory filings.
908259_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	External services include manufacturing for our drug product for clinical use, manufacturing for our drug product required for regulatory filings, clinical research organizations, clinical site services, labs and other outside services.
908259_15_ITEM7_P18_S4	The cost of drug product is expensed as manufactured and the associated cost can be impacted by the timing of when we need drug product for research and clinical trials and supplying drug for potential regulatory filings.
908259_15_ITEM7_P18_S5	The increase in external services expense in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, is primarily attributable to clinical research organization, clinical site services and consulting costs related to the GI-NET Phase 2 clinical trial that was initiated in 2014 and for the manufacturing of drug product for clinical use and potentially to support any regulatory filings.
908259_15_ITEM7_P18_S6	To a lesser extent, the increase in external services is also due to our use of consultant services related to the evaluation of our ovarian cancer program and the results from the GOG-0186I Phase 2 clinical trial in ovarian cancer and planning related to our AML clinical program.
908259_15_ITEM7_P18_S7	The increase in external services expense in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, is primarily attributable to costs associated with manufacturing our drug product primarily for clinical use and potentially to support any regulatory filings.
908259_15_ITEM7_P18_S8	The increase in manufacturing expenses in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, was offset in part by a decrease in external services due to the completion of the previous clinical trials as referenced above.
908259_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Employee compensation and related expenses include employee compensation, incentive compensation, temporary help, employee benefits and travel.
908259_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	additional research and development personnel and an employee incentive compensation program established in 2014.
908259_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	The reduction in employee compensation and related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, was due to a reduction in clinical employees and related employee costs due to delays in initiating new clinical trials.
908259_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	Employee stock-based compensation expense increased in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to December 31, 2013 and decreased in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.
908259_15_ITEM7_P20_S3	The increase in 2014 is primarily due to additional personnel while the decrease in 2013 is due primarily to the reduction in the number of personnel as described above; this amount can also vary significantly from period to period due to the timing and vesting of option grants.
908259_15_ITEM7_P20_S4	Other expenses include facility expenses and licensing fees and amortization.
908259_15_ITEM7_P20_S5	The increase in other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 is due primarily to licensing fees.
908259_15_ITEM7_P20_S6	The decrease in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, is primarily due to a reduction in facilities and related expenses.
908259_15_ITEM7_P20_S7	Based on our business strategy as outlined in the business section above, we expect research and development expenses to increase in the year ending December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
908259_15_ITEM7_P20_S8	The costs of our GI-NET clinical program will increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 as we incur costs associated with the Phase 2 clinical trial for an entire year as compared to a partial year in 2014 and incur costs associated with a rollover clinical trial which is designed to treat patients for one year after they complete the Phase 2 clinical trial if they have responded to fosbretabulin.
908259_15_ITEM7_P20_S9	Additionally, we expect to incur costs associated with sponsoring our AML Phase 1/2 clinical trial in-house and closing down the AML Phase 1 trial sponsored by the University of Florida.
908259_15_ITEM7_P20_S10	Therefore, research and development expenses are expected to increase in 2015 as compared to 2014.
908259_15_ITEM7_P20_S11	General and administrative expenses The table below summarizes the most significant components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated, in thousands, and the amount and percentage change in these components Employee compensation and related expenses increased in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to severance expense recorded in 2014 related to the departure of an officer and an employee incentive compensation program established in 2014, offset in part by a bonus paid to an officer in 2013 as compensation for income taxes related to a restricted stock grant.
908259_15_ITEM7_P20_S12	Employee compensation and related expenses decreased in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, because in 2012 we incurred transition costs related to the consolidation of our Massachusetts administrative offices, including consolidating our finance department, to our California headquarters.
908259_15_ITEM7_P20_S13	Employee stock-based compensation expense decreased in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, and increased in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to a restricted stock grant to an officer in 2013 valued at $200,000.
908259_15_ITEM7_P20_S14	This amount can also vary significantly from period to period due to the timing and vesting of option grants.
908259_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	offset in part by decreases related to legal and accounting fees.
908259_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Consulting and professional services increased in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, due primarily to legal costs associated with financing efforts which were delayed and therefore expensed, and board compensation for increased membership, offset in part by lower consulting costs associated with investor relations and shareholder meeting costs.
908259_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Other expense decreased in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the decrease of expenditures related to corporate fees such as Delaware franchise tax and transfer agent fees, offset in part by the increase in NASDAQ fees associated with the listing of additional shares, as a result of our February and May 2014 financing transactions and exercises of warrants.
908259_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	Other expenses decreased in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 due primarily to a reduction in facility related costs, including insurance, due to the closing of our administrative offices in Massachusetts and the consolidation of our offices in South San Francisco into a smaller space.
908259_15_ITEM7_P21_S4	We continue to evaluate general and administrative expenses and look for ways to decrease such costs.
908259_15_ITEM7_P21_S5	As discussed above, we have increased our research and development activities in 2014 and expect to increase them further in the 2015 fiscal year, in which case general and administrative expenses could increase in support of research and development activities.
908259_15_ITEM7_P21_S6	As a result, general and administrative expenses in the future could vary significantly from those incurred in the 2014 fiscal year.
908259_15_ITEM7_P21_S7	Restructuring expenses We recorded a restructuring charge of $1,226,000 in the year ended December 31, 2011 and recorded net adjustments to the charge of $15,000 in the year ended December 31, 2012.
908259_15_ITEM7_P21_S8	This charge was a result of a restructuring plan announced on September 1, 2011, which included a reduction in work force, and was designed to focus our capital resources on our most promising early-stage clinical programs and further reduce our cash utilization.
908259_15_ITEM7_P21_S9	The restructuring was completed in 2012.
908259_15_ITEM7_P21_S10	Other Income and Expenses The table below summarizes the components of Other Income and Expenses for the periods indicated, in thousands:
908259_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	We recorded an unrealized (non-cash) gain in the years ended December 31, 2012 as a result of the change in the estimated fair market value of our common stock warrants issued in connection with private placements of shares of our common stock.
908259_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Investment income primarily reflects increases and decrease in cash balances due to interest earned on our operating cash accounts.
908259_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	Other (expense) income primarily reflect foreign exchange gains and losses which can vary depending on exchange rates agreements with foreign vendors and the timing of expenditures.
908259_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	Tax Matters At December 31, 2014, we had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $224,291,000 for U.S. income tax purposes, which will begin to expire for U.S. purposes in 2020.
908259_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	related to the ultimate use of these loss carry-forwards, we have fully reserved this future benefit.
908259_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	Additionally, the future utilization of the U.S. net operating loss carry-forwards is subject to limitations under the change in stock ownership rules of the Internal Revenue Service.
908259_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	The valuation allowance increased by approximately $3,878,000 from the year ended December 31, 2013 to the year ended December 31, 2014 and increased by approximately $2,642,000 from the year ended December 31, 2012 to the year ended December 31, 2013.
908259_15_ITEM7_P24_S3	The increase for both 2013 and 2014 was due primarily to the increase in the federal net operating loss.
908259_15_ITEM7_P24_S4	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES To date, we have financed our operations principally through net proceeds received from private and public equity financings and through a strategic development arrangement which concluded in 2009.
908259_15_ITEM7_P24_S5	We have experienced negative cash flow from operations each year since our inception, except in the year 2000.
908259_15_ITEM7_P24_S6	As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $251,155,000.
908259_15_ITEM7_P24_S7	We expect to continue to incur increased expenses, resulting in losses, over at least the next several years due to, among other factors, our continuing and planned clinical trials and anticipated research and development activities.
908259_15_ITEM7_P24_S8	We had cash of approximately $30,031,000 at December 31, 2014.
908259_15_ITEM7_P24_S9	The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated, in thousands:
908259_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	The net cash used in operating activities was $12,151,000 in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $7,001,000 in the comparable period in 2013.
908259_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	The net cash used in both periods was primarily attributable to the net losses, adjusted to exclude certain non-cash items, primarily stock based compensation.
908259_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	Net cash used in the 2014 period was also impacted by an increase in accrued compensation offset in part by prepaid expenses related primarily to clinical research organization fees.
908259_15_ITEM7_P25_S3	The net cash used in operating activities was $7,001,000 in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $8,335,000 in the comparable period in 2012.
908259_15_ITEM7_P25_S4	The net cash used in both periods was primarily attributable to the net losses, adjusted to exclude certain non-cash items, primarily stock based compensation.

908259_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	Net cash used in operating activities in the year 2012 was also impacted significantly by the pay down of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, as many of our clinical trial programs were winding down.

908259_15_ITEM7_P26_S5	Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the sale of preferred stock and warrants in private placements in April and September 2013, net of the redemption of a portion of the preferred stock issued in April 2013, and to a lesser extent from the sale of common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement, as discussed below.

908259_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	We are limited as to how many shares we can sell pursuant to the ATM Agreement due to SEC limitations on the number of shares issuable pursuant to a Form S-3 registration statement in a primary offering by smaller reporting companies.
908259_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	Subject to these restrictions, we may be able to sell more shares under this agreement depending on several factors, including the Company s stock price, the number of shares of our common stock outstanding and the timing of the occurrence of the sales.
908259_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	In connection with the ATM Agreement, we issued 422,000 shares of common stock for proceeds of approximately $1,936,000 net of issuance costs, during the year ended December 31, 2013 and issued no shares of common stock under this agreement during the year ended December 31, 2014.

908259_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	This agreement expired January 11, 2015.
908259_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	We did not have the ability to sell shares under this arrangement if we failed to maintain a minimum stock price of $6.00 or if we failed to maintain the effectiveness of a registration statement filed with the SEC.
908259_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	If our stock price rose above $6.00 and the other conditions of the arrangement were met, we could direct LPC to purchase up to $20,000,000 worth of shares of our common stock under our agreement over a 36-month period ending January 11, 2015, in amounts of up to $200,000, which amounts could be increased under certain circumstances.
908259_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	During the term of the LPC Purchase Agreement, we generally controlled the timing and amount of any sales to LPC in accordance with the LPC Purchase Agreement.
908259_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	LPC had no right to require us to sell any shares to LPC, but LPC was obligated to make purchases as we directed, subject to certain conditions, which included the continuing effectiveness of a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering the resale of the shares that may be issued to LPC and limitations related to the market value of our common stock.

908259_15_ITEM7_P38_S7	The warrants contain limitations that prevent each holder of warrants from acquiring shares upon exercise of the warrants that would cause the number of shares beneficially owned by it and its affiliates to exceed 4.99% of the total number of shares of our common stock then issued and outstanding, provided that, upon prior notice to us, a holder may increase or decrease this limitation provided any increase does not exceed 9.99% of the total number of shares of our common stock then issued and outstanding.
908259_15_ITEM7_P38_S8	In addition, upon certain changes in control of the Company, each holder of a warrant can elect to receive, subject to certain limitations and assumptions, securities in a successor entity.
908259_15_ITEM7_P38_S9	None of the warrants issued on March 25, 2015 have been exercised.
908259_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	After our financing in March 2015, we expect our existing cash to support our operations through approximately the end of 2017.
908259_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	We expect this level of cash utilization to allow us to continue our ongoing programs, including completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of fosbretabulin in patients with recurrent GI-NETs with elevated biomarkers, including a rollover clinical trial designed to treat patients for one year after they complete the Phase 2 clinical trial if they have responded to fosbretabulin, the initiation and completion of the Phase 1 portion, and initiation of the Phase 2 portion of an open label clinical trial of OXi4503 in patients with AML to be sponsored by us and supporting a Phase 1b/2 trial of fosbretabulin in relapsed ovarian cancer in combination with Votrient (pazopanib) being sponsored by two UK based nonprofit organizations.
908259_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	While our existing cash will support the planning for a follow-on clinical program in fosbretabulin for the treatment of advanced recurrent ovarian cancer, it does not allow for conducting any follow-on clinical studies of fosbretabulin in advanced ovarian cancer.
908259_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	Any significant further development of fosbretabulin or other capital intensive activities will be contingent upon our ability to raise additional capital in addition to the capital available to us under our existing financing arrangements.
908259_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	unapplied purchase orders for expenditures related to clinical research activities and outsourced drug manufacturing of approximately $4,803,000, of which approximately $92,000 was estimated and accrued at December 31, 2014 for services performed, leaving approximately $4,711,000 to be incurred.
908259_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	Of the $4,711,000 amount to be incurred, we may incur approximately $2,353,000 over the next twelve months.
908259_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	We will require significant additional funding to fund operations and to continue the development of our product candidates.
908259_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	Our ongoing capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including: the progress and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates under development, including fosbretabulin and OXi4503; the costs of complying with FDA and other regulatory agency requirements; the progress of our research and development programs; the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals; the resources, if any, that we devote to develop manufacturing methods and advanced technologies; our ability to enter into licensing arrangements, including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs; the costs and expenses of filing, prosecuting and, if necessary, enforcing our patent claims, or defending against possible claims of infringement by third-party patent or other technology rights; the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, if any, undertaken by us; and, if and when approved, the demand for our products, which demand depends in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known, understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval, including the range of indications for which any product is granted approval.
908259_15_ITEM7_P40_S4	If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we will not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we will be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs or cease operations.
908259_15_ITEM7_P40_S5	We may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements.
908259_15_ITEM7_P40_S6	Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	If we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish, on terms that are not favorable to us, rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize.
908259_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	Our failure to raise capital when needed will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	The following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2014 (in thousands):
908259_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Payments under clinical development and related commitments are based on the completion of activities as specified in the contract.
908259_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	The amounts in the table above assume the successful completion, by the third-party contractor, of all of the activities contemplated in the agreements.
908259_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Our primary drug development programs are based on a series of natural products called Combretastatins.
908259_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	In August 1999, we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by Arizona State University.
908259_15_ITEM7_P43_S2	This agreement was subsequently amended in June 2002.
908259_15_ITEM7_P43_S3	From the inception of the agreement through December 31, 2013, we have paid a total of $2,600,000 in connection with this license.
908259_15_ITEM7_P43_S4	The agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals, which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones, as defined in the agreement.
908259_15_ITEM7_P43_S5	The license agreement also provides for additional payments upon our election to develop certain additional compounds, as defined in the agreement.
908259_15_ITEM7_P43_S6	Future milestone payments under this agreement could total $100,000.
908259_15_ITEM7_P43_S7	We are also required to pay royalties on future net sales of products associated with these patent rights.
908259_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	We also have an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, for the commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including among others, fosbretabulin.
908259_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	Under the BMS license, we have the right to grant sublicenses.
908259_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	Under the license agreement, BMS is entitled to low-single-digit royalty payments for all commercial sales plus any remuneration OXiGENE receives for sale of fosbretabulin under named patient or compassionate use programs.
908259_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	All licensing fees and milestone payments under the license agreement, in the aggregate amount of $1,080,000, have been paid.
908259_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	We bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the BMS license and have a right, but not a duty, of enforcing patents covered by the license.
908259_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	Either party may terminate the license upon material default of the other party.
908259_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We have adopted an Investment Policy, the primary objectives of which are to preserve principal, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields while preserving principal.
908259_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Although our investments are subject to credit risk, we follow procedures to limit the amount of credit exposure in any single issue, issuer or type of investment.
908259_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase.
908259_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	However, due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration, we believe that interest rate risk is mitigated.
908259_15_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in U.S. dollar accounts.
908259_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Although we may from time to time manufacture drugs and conduct trials and studies outside of the United States, we believe our exposure to foreign currency risk to be immaterial.
908259_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	See Item 15 for a list of our Financial Statements and Schedules and Supplementary Information filed as part of this Annual Report.
908259_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	under the Exchange Act and report on the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
908259_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of December 31, 2014, to ensure that we record, process, summarize and report the information we must disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
908259_15_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, identified in connection with the evaluation of such control that occurred during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
908259_15_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
908259_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 Framework) (COSO).
908259_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014.
908259_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
908259_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC.
908259_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud.
908259_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time.
908259_15_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.
908259_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Because we are not an accelerated filer, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, Ernst Young LLP was not required to issue an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting and, therefore, did not perform for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 an audit of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

908259_15_ITEM15_P36_S0	The following financial statements of OXiGENE, Inc. are included in Item 8:
908259_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of OXiGENE, Inc.
908259_15_ITEM15_P37_S1	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of OXiGENE, Inc. as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related statements of comprehensive loss, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014.
908259_15_ITEM15_P37_S2	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
908259_15_ITEM15_P37_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
908259_15_ITEM15_P37_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
908259_15_ITEM15_P37_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
908259_15_ITEM15_P37_S6	We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
908259_15_ITEM15_P37_S7	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
908259_15_ITEM15_P37_S8	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
908259_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
908259_15_ITEM15_P38_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
908259_15_ITEM15_P38_S2	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of OXiGENE, Inc. at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
908259_15_ITEM15_P39_S0	Statements of Cash Flows (All amounts in thousands) See accompanying notes.
908259_15_ITEM15_P40_S0	OXiGENE, INC. Notes to Financial Statements December 31, 2014 1.
908259_15_ITEM15_P40_S1	Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business OXiGENE, Inc. (the Company ), is incorporated in the state of Delaware, and is a clinical-stage, biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics primarily to treat cancer.
908259_15_ITEM15_P40_S2	The Company s major focus is developing vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) that selectively disrupt abnormal blood vessels associated with solid tumor progression.
908259_15_ITEM15_P40_S3	The Company is dedicated to leveraging its intellectual property and therapeutic development expertise to bring life-extending and life-enhancing medicines to patients.
908259_15_ITEM15_P40_S4	The Company has two VDA drug candidates currently being tested in clinical trials, fosbretabulin and OXi4503.
908259_15_ITEM15_P41_S0	Capital Resources The Company has experienced net losses every year since inception and, as of December 31, 2014, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $251,155,000 the Company expects to incur significant additional operating losses over at least the next several years, principally as a result of the Company s continuing clinical trials and anticipated research and development expenditures.
908259_15_ITEM15_P41_S1	The principal source of the Company s working capital to date has been the proceeds of private and public equity financings and to a lesser extent the exercise of warrants and stock options.
908259_15_ITEM15_P41_S2	The Company currently has no recurring material amount of income.
908259_15_ITEM15_P41_S3	As of December 31, 2014, the Company had approximately $30,031,000 in cash.
908259_15_ITEM15_P41_S4	The company also raised $10.0 million in gross proceeds, or approximately $9.35 million in net proceeds after deducting placement agents fees, and before deducting other offering expenses, in a registered direct offering of common stock and warrants in March 2015, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements.
908259_15_ITEM15_P41_S5	The Company expects its existing cash to support its operations through approximately the end of 2017.
908259_15_ITEM15_P41_S6	The Company expects this level of cash utilization to allow it to continue its ongoing programs, including completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of fosbretabulin in patients with recurrent GI-NETs with elevated biomarkers, including a rollover clinical trial designed to treat patients for one year after they complete the Phase 2 clinical trial if they have responded to fosbretabulin, the initiation and completion of the Phase 1 portion, and initiation of the Phase 2 portion, of an open label clinical trial of OXi4503 in patients with AML to be sponsored by the Company; and supporting a Phase 1b/2 trial of fosbretabulin in relapsed ovarian cancer in combination with Votrient (pazopanib), being sponsored by two UK-based nonprofit organizations.
908259_15_ITEM15_P41_S7	While the Company s existing cash will support the planning for a follow-on clinical program in fosbretabulin for the treatment of ovarian cancer, any significant further development of fosbretabulin in advanced recurrent ovarian cancer, including the potential development of a special protocol assessment with the FDA, and conducting follow-on clinical studies or other capital intensive activities, will be contingent upon the Company s ability to raise additional capital in addition to its existing financing arrangements or from a collaborative research agreement with a third-party, as to which the Company can give no assurance.
908259_15_ITEM15_P41_S8	Additional funding may not be available to OXiGENE on acceptable terms, or at all.
908259_15_ITEM15_P41_S9	If the Company is unable to access additional funds when needed, it may not be able to continue the development of its product candidates or the Company could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of its development programs and other operations.
908259_15_ITEM15_P41_S10	Any additional equity financing, if available to the Company, may not be available on favorable terms, would most likely be dilutive to its current stockholders and debt financing, if available, and may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_15_ITEM15_P41_S11	If the Company accesses funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, it may be required to relinquish rights to some of its technologies or product candidates that it would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on its own, on terms that are not favorable to the Company.
908259_15_ITEM15_P41_S12	The Company s ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, will materially harm its business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_15_ITEM15_P41_S13	The Company s ability to raise additional capital could also be impaired if it is unable to comply with the listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market and instead has to trade its common shares in the over-the-counter market.
908259_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
908259_15_ITEM15_P42_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
908259_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk The Company has no significant off balance sheet concentrations of credit risk.
908259_15_ITEM15_P43_S1	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash.
908259_15_ITEM15_P43_S2	The Company holds its cash and cash equivalents at one financial institution.
908259_15_ITEM15_P43_S3	Fair Value The Company is required to disclose information on all assets and liabilities reported at fair value that enables an assessment of the inputs used in determining the reported fair values.
908259_15_ITEM15_P43_S4	Fair value hierarchy is now established that prioritizes valuation inputs based on the observable nature of those inputs.
908259_15_ITEM15_P43_S5	The fair value hierarchy applies only to the valuation inputs used in determining the reported fair value of the Company s investments and is not a measure of the investment credit quality.
908259_15_ITEM15_P43_S6	The hierarchy defines three levels of valuation inputs:
908259_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company did not hold any assets or liabilities subject to measurement on a recurring basis.
908259_15_ITEM15_P44_S1	The Company was required to measure, on a non-recurring basis, the fair value of its convertible preferred stock and warrants issued in the April 2013 and September 2013 financing transactions.
908259_15_ITEM15_P44_S2	The methods and assumptions used to value those instruments are disclosed in Note 6 to the financial statements.
908259_15_ITEM15_P45_S0	Furniture and Fixtures, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements Furniture and fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost.
908259_15_ITEM15_P45_S1	Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years, or the applicable lease term.
908259_15_ITEM15_P45_S2	The carrying value of the license agreement with Arizona State University (ASU) was amortized over the term of the agreement, which was approximately 15.5 years (see Note 3), and now has a carrying value of $0.
908259_15_ITEM15_P45_S3	The technology licensed from ASU is related to the Company s fosbretabulin and OXi4503 programs.
908259_15_ITEM15_P46_S0	The Company is required to perform an impairment analysis of its long-lived assets if triggering events occur.
908259_15_ITEM15_P46_S1	The Company reviews for such triggering events, such as a going concern opinion and continuing losses, periodically.
908259_15_ITEM15_P47_S0	Both the fosbretabulin and OXi4503 programs utilize intellectual property under the license agreement, demonstrating alternative future use in other research and development projects.
908259_15_ITEM15_P48_S0	The license agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals, which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones as defined in the agreement.
908259_15_ITEM15_P48_S1	The Company expenses these payments to research and development in the period the obligation becomes both probable and estimable.
908259_15_ITEM15_P49_S0	Accrued Research and Development The Company charges all research and development expenses, both internal and external costs, to operations as incurred.
908259_15_ITEM15_P49_S1	The Company s research and development costs represent expenses incurred from the engagement of outside professional service organizations, product manufacturers and consultants associated with the development of the Company s potential product candidates.
908259_15_ITEM15_P49_S2	The Company recognizes expenses associated with these arrangements based on the completion of activities as specified in the applicable contracts.
908259_15_ITEM15_P49_S3	Costs incurred under fixed-fee contracts are expensed ratably over the contract period absent any knowledge that the services will be performed other than ratably.
908259_15_ITEM15_P49_S4	Costs incurred under contracts with clinical trial sites and principal investigators are generally accrued on a patient-treated basis consistent with the terms outlined in the contract.
908259_15_ITEM15_P49_S5	In determining costs incurred on some of these programs, the Company takes into consideration a number of factors, including estimates and input provided by internal program managers.
908259_15_ITEM15_P49_S6	Upon termination of such contracts, the Company is normally only liable for costs incurred and committed to date.
908259_15_ITEM15_P49_S7	As a result, accrued research and development expenses represent the Company s reasonably estimated contractual liability to outside service providers at any particular point in time.
908259_15_ITEM15_P50_S0	In December 2011, the Company established a distribution agreement to provide access to fosbretabulin for the treatment of patients with ATC in certain specified territories on a compassionate use basis.
908259_15_ITEM15_P50_S1	This agreement was terminated effective December 31, 2014.
908259_15_ITEM15_P50_S2	The agreement provided that upon the receipt of fosbretabulin by the distributor for distribution and sale to compassionate use patients, the distributor had 30 days to inspect the product for defects and to ensure that the product conformed to the warranties made by the Company.
908259_15_ITEM15_P50_S3	If the distributor did not notify the Company of any defective products within the 30-day period it was deemed to have accepted the products.
908259_15_ITEM15_P50_S4	Revenue was recognized based on products being accepted at the conclusion of the 30-day inspection period.
908259_15_ITEM15_P50_S5	Also, the distributor was obligated to pay to the Company, on a quarterly basis, an amount equal to 20% of the distributor s gross margin, as defined in the agreement, on its sales of fosbretabulin in the preceding quarter, less the cost of introductory drug provided at no cost.
908259_15_ITEM15_P50_S6	This revenue was recognized upon notification from the distributor of the gross margin earned.
908259_15_ITEM15_P51_S0	Fosbretabulin was expensed at the time it was manufactured, because it is in the development stage and there was not an alternative future use.
908259_15_ITEM15_P51_S1	As a result, the product provided to the distributor has a zero cost basis, and therefore no cost-of-goods-sold has been recorded.
908259_15_ITEM15_P51_S2	For the periods presented, there are no components of other comprehensive income or accumulated comprehensive income and net loss is equal to comprehensive loss.
908259_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	Stock-based Compensation The Company expenses the estimated fair value of all share-based payments issued to employees on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

908259_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	The Company has filed applications for patents in connection with technologies being developed.
908259_15_ITEM15_P54_S1	The patent applications and any patents issued as a result of these applications are important to the protection of the Company s technologies that may result from its research and development efforts.
908259_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	Costs associated with patent applications and maintaining patents are expensed as general and administrative expense as incurred.
908259_15_ITEM15_P56_S0	Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes based upon the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes.
908259_15_ITEM15_P56_S1	Under ASC 740, deferred taxes are recognized using the liability method whereby tax rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes based on when and how they are expected to affect the tax return.
908259_15_ITEM15_P57_S0	The Company reviews all activity subsequent to year end but prior to the issuance of the financial statements for events that could require disclosure or which could impact the carrying value of assets or liabilities as of the balance sheet date.

908259_15_ITEM15_P77_S1	Currently, the 2005 Plan allows for awards of up to 200,000 shares that may be granted to any one participant in any fiscal year.
908259_15_ITEM15_P77_S2	For options subject to graded vesting, the Company elected the straight-line method of expensing these awards over the service period.
908259_15_ITEM15_P78_S0	The following is a summary of the Company s stock option activity under its 2005 Plan for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014: As of December 31, 2014 there was approximately $515,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards that is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of approximately 2.68 years.
908259_15_ITEM15_P78_S1	The following stock options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012:
908259_15_ITEM15_P79_S0	The fair values for the stock options granted were estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for the three years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012:
908259_15_ITEM15_P80_S0	In calculating the estimated fair value of its stock options, the Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires the consideration of the following six variables for purposes of estimating fair value:
908259_15_ITEM15_P81_S0	the risk-free interest rate for the expected option term.
908259_15_ITEM15_P81_S1	The closing market price of its common stock on the date of grant.
908259_15_ITEM15_P82_S0	The expected term of options represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on an analysis of historical behavior of participants over time.
908259_15_ITEM15_P82_S1	The expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Company s stock price is expected to fluctuate during the term of the option granted.
908259_15_ITEM15_P82_S2	The Company determines the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of its common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term.
908259_15_ITEM15_P82_S3	Expected Dividends Because the Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on any of its common stock and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future, the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option.
908259_15_ITEM15_P83_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury issues with a remaining life consistent with the option s expected term on the date of grant.
908259_15_ITEM15_P83_S1	The Company is required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
908259_15_ITEM15_P83_S2	This requirement applies to all awards that are not yet vested, including awards granted prior to January 1, 2006.
908259_15_ITEM15_P83_S3	Accordingly, the Company performed a historical analysis of option awards that were forfeited prior to vesting, and ultimately recorded total stock option expense that reflected this estimated forfeiture rate.
908259_15_ITEM15_P83_S4	The Company recorded expenses of $20,000, $259,913 and $0 during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, related to restricted stock awards granted from the Company s 2005 Stock Plan.

908259_15_ITEM15_P83_S6	As of December 31, 2014, the Company did not have any non-vested restricted common stock outstanding.
908259_15_ITEM15_P83_S7	The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which was suspended in 2012.

908259_15_ITEM15_P83_S10	Currently, an aggregate of 10,417 shares of common stock may be issued under the 2009 ESPP, subject to adjustment each year pursuant to the terms of the 2009 ESPP.
908259_15_ITEM15_P84_S0	Basic and diluted net loss per share was calculated by dividing the net loss per share attributed to the Company s common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
908259_15_ITEM15_P85_S0	share includes the effect of all dilutive, potentially issuable common equivalent shares as defined using the treasury stock method.
908259_15_ITEM15_P85_S1	All of the Company s common stock equivalents are anti-dilutive due to the Company s net loss position for all periods presented.

908259_15_ITEM15_P86_S2	The increase for both 2013 and 2014 was due primarily to the increase in the federal net operating loss.
908259_15_ITEM15_P86_S3	At December 31, 2014, the Company had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $224,291,000 for U.S. income tax purposes, which will begin to expire in 2020 and state operating loss carry-forwards of $55,365,000 in California that will begin to expire in 2017.

908259_15_ITEM15_P88_S0	A reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the Company s effective tax rate is as follows: ASC 740-10-50 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
908259_15_ITEM15_P88_S1	ASC 740-10-50 also provides guidance on de-recognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.

908259_15_ITEM15_P90_S1	As of December 31, 2014, due to a valuation allowance against the Company s deferred tax assets, none of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the Company s effective tax rate.
908259_15_ITEM15_P90_S2	There are currently no federal or state audits in progress, tax years still subject to examination for Federal and the State authorities include all prior years due to the existence of net operating loss carry-forwards.

908259_15_ITEM15_P129_S0	The company has developed and maintains a system of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are executed in accordance with management s authorization, are properly recorded and posted, and are in compliance with regulatory requirements.
908259_15_ITEM15_P129_S1	The system of internal controls within the company includes written policies and procedures, budgetary controls, supervisory review and monitoring, and various other checks and balances, and safeguards.
908259_15_ITEM15_P129_S2	The company has also developed and maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that all of the information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.
908259_15_ITEM15_P129_S3	Associates are expected to be familiar with, and to adhere strictly to, these internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures.
908259_15_ITEM15_P130_S0	Responsibility for compliance with these internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures rests not solely with the company s accounting personnel, but with all associates involved in approving transactions, supplying documentation for transactions, and recording, processing, summarizing and reporting of transactions and other information required by periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
908259_15_ITEM15_P130_S1	Because the integrity of the company s external reports to shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission depends on the integrity of the company s internal reports and record-keeping, all associates must adhere to the highest standards of care with respect to the company s internal records and reporting.

908259_15_ITEM15_P131_S3	Associates must handle such records in accordance with the procedures outlined in the company s document retention policy.
908259_15_ITEM15_P131_S4	When in doubt regarding retention of any record, an associate must not discard or alter the record in question and should seek guidance from the Compliance Committee.

Receiving Gifts Gifts, favors, entertainment or other inducements may not be accepted by associates or members of their immediate families from any person or organization that does or seeks to do business with, or is a competitor of, the company, except as common courtesies usually associated with customary business practices.
908259_15_ITEM15_P137_S1	If the gift is of more than token value, the Compliance Committee must approve its acceptance.
908259_15_ITEM15_P137_S2	An especially strict standard applies when suppliers are involved.
908259_15_ITEM15_P137_S3	If a gift unduly influences or makes an associate feel obligated to pay back the other party with business, receipt of the gift is unacceptable.

908259_15_ITEM15_P138_S1	The following practices can lead to liability for unfair competition and should be avoided.
908259_15_ITEM15_P138_S2	They are violations of the Code.
908259_15_ITEM15_P139_S0	It is not illegal to point out weaknesses in a competitor s service, product or operation; however, associates may not spread false rumors about competitors or make misrepresentations about their businesses.
908259_15_ITEM15_P139_S1	For example, an associate may not pass on anecdotal or unverified stories about a competitor s products or services as the absolute truth (e.g., the statement that our competitors diagnostic testing procedures have poor quality control ).
908259_15_ITEM15_P139_S2	This includes bribing a competitor s employees, posing as prospective customers or using deceptive practices such as enticing away employees in order to obtain secrets or destroy a competitor s organization.
908259_15_ITEM15_P139_S3	For example, it is not a valid form of market research to visit a competitor s place of business posing as a customer.
908259_15_ITEM15_P140_S0	D. Unfair Practices in International Business Under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ), associates of the company are prohibited from making certain gifts to foreign officials.
908259_15_ITEM15_P141_S0	Foreign officials include not only persons acting in an official capacity on behalf of a foreign government, agency, department or instrumentality, but also representatives of international organizations, foreign political parties and candidates for foreign public office.
908259_15_ITEM15_P142_S0	The gift is corrupt under the FCPA if it is made for the purpose of:
908259_15_ITEM15_P143_S0	Inducing a foreign official to secure any improper advantage.
908259_15_ITEM15_P143_S1	A gift is still corrupt even when paid through an intermediary.
908259_15_ITEM15_P143_S2	Any associate who has any questions whatsoever as to whether a particular gift might be corrupt under the FCPA, please contact the Compliance Committee.
908259_15_ITEM15_P144_S0	GOVERNMENT RELATIONS Associates must adhere to the highest standards of ethical conduct in all relationships with government employees and must not improperly attempt to influence the actions of any public official.
908259_15_ITEM15_P145_S0	A. Payments to Officials Payments or gifts shall not be made directly or indirectly to any government official or associate if the gift or payment is illegal under the laws of the country having jurisdiction over the transaction, or if it is for the purpose of influencing or inducing the recipient to do, or omit to do, any act in violation of his or her lawful duty.
908259_15_ITEM15_P145_S1	Under no circumstances should gifts be given to employees of the United States Government.
908259_15_ITEM15_P146_S0	B. Political Contributions Company funds, property or services may not be contributed to any political party or committee, or to any candidate for or holder of any office of any government.
908259_15_ITEM15_P146_S1	This policy does not preclude, where lawful, company expenditures to support or oppose public referendum or separate ballot issues, or, where lawful and when reviewed and approved in advance by the Compliance Committee, the formation and operation of a political action committee.
908259_15_ITEM15_P147_S0	The company expressly forbids any associate from trading on material non-public information or communicating material non-public information to others in violation of the law.
908259_15_ITEM15_P147_S1	This conduct is frequently referred to as insider trading.
908259_15_ITEM15_P147_S2	This policy applies to every associate of the company and extends to activities both within and outside their duties to the company, including trading for a personal account.
908259_15_ITEM15_P148_S0	The concept of who is an insider is broad.
908259_15_ITEM15_P148_S1	It includes officers, directors and employees of a company.
908259_15_ITEM15_P148_S2	In addition, a person can be a temporary insider if he or she enters into a special confidential relationship in the conduct of a company s affairs and as a result is given access to information solely for the company s purpose.
908259_15_ITEM15_P148_S3	A temporary insider can include, among others, a company s investment advisors, agents, attorneys, accountants and lending institutions, as well as the employees of such organizations.
908259_15_ITEM15_P148_S4	An associate may also become a temporary insider of another company with which the company has a contractual relationship, to which it provides advice or for which it performs other services.
908259_15_ITEM15_P149_S0	Trading on inside information is not a basis for liability unless the information is material.
908259_15_ITEM15_P150_S0	This is information that a reasonable investor would consider important in making his or her investment decisions, or information that is likely to have a significant effect on the price of a company s securities.
908259_15_ITEM15_P150_S1	Information is non-public until it has been effectively communicated to the marketplace.
908259_15_ITEM15_P150_S2	Tangible evidence of such dissemination is the best indication that the information is public.
908259_15_ITEM15_P150_S3	For example, information found in a report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or appearing in a national newspaper would be considered public.
908259_15_ITEM15_P150_S4	Each associate should be familiar with and abide by the company s Insider Trading Policy.

908259_15_ITEM15_P156_S2	The company will endeavor to keep reports confidential to the fullest extent practicable under the circumstances.
908259_15_ITEM15_P156_S3	Any associate who reports a suspected violation under the Code by the company, or its agents acting on behalf of the company, to the Compliance Committee or the Hotline, may not be fired, demoted, reprimanded or otherwise harmed for, or because of, the reporting of the suspected violation, regardless of whether the suspected violation involves the associate, the associate s supervisor or senior management of the company.

908259_15_ITEM15_P158_S1	If any situation should arise where a course of action would likely result in a violation of the Code but for which the associate thinks that a valid reason for the course of action exists, the associate should contact the Compliance Committee to obtain a waiver prior to the time the action is taken.
908259_15_ITEM15_P158_S2	Absent exceptional circumstances, no waivers will be granted after the fact for actions already taken.

908259_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	Business Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of vascular disrupting agents, or VDAs, for the treatment of cancer.
908259_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	VDAs selectively target the vasculature of cancer tumors and obstruct a tumor s blood supply without disrupting the blood supply to normal tissues.
908259_16_ITEM1_P0_S2	Treatment with VDAs has been shown to lead to significant central tumor necrosis, which refers to the death of cancer cells.
908259_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	VDAs are in a class of drugs called vascular targeted therapies, or VTTs, which also includes anti-angiogenic agents, or AAs.
908259_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	There are over 12 AAs approved in the U.S. for over 15 different oncology indications, and according to Datamonitor, 2015 sales for AAs are estimated to exceed $10 billion.
908259_16_ITEM1_P1_S2	Genentech s bevacizumab (Avastin ) has the greatest market share in the class, with 2015 estimated sales of approximately $6.7 billion.
908259_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	Bevacizumab and other AA drugs work by preventing the growth of new blood vessels which can supply nutrients to tumor cells.
908259_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	We are seeking to realize the full potential of VTTs in oncology by using the combination of VDAs and AAs to treat cancer tumors.
908259_16_ITEM1_P2_S2	When VDAs and AAs are used in combination, our VDAs have been shown to directly cut off the blood supply to the interior of the tumor, while the AA inhibits angiogenesis, which is the process by which new blood vessels form and re-vascularize the tumor.
908259_16_ITEM1_P2_S3	Our current VDA development plans are focused on this combination, in which the mechanism of action of each drug complements that of the other disrupting tumor blood supply in two different ways instead of just one.
908259_16_ITEM1_P2_S4	We believe that the indirect inhibition on angiogenesis (provided by the AA) combined with the direct effect on established tumor blood vessels (provided by the VDA) would result in a significantly greater benefit to patients than the anti-vascular effect of either drug alone.
908259_16_ITEM1_P2_S5	Our belief is supported by both clinical and preclinical studies, which demonstrate an increased benefit in terms of progression-free survival from treatment with our VDA, known as CA4P, when it is used in combination with approved AAs.
908259_16_ITEM1_P2_S6	Historically, however, the majority of our clinical trials have used VDAs as a single agent.
908259_16_ITEM1_P2_S7	We are currently developing two clinical stage investigational drugs, both VDAs CA4P and OXi4503.
908259_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our lead compound is CA4P, which is also known as combretastatin A4-phosphate, fosbretabulin tromethamine, fosbretabulin and ZYBRESTAT .
908259_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	The largest clinical trial of CA4P conducted to date was a recent phase 2 clinical trial in recurrent ovarian cancer sponsored by the Gynecologic Oncology Group, or GOG, which was completed in 2014 and met its primary endpoint by demonstrating an improvement in progression-free survival for the patients who received CA4P. This trial, referred to as GOG-0186I, compared treatment with CA4P plus bevacizumab to treatment with bevacizumab alone.
908259_16_ITEM1_P3_S2	Based on the positive results of this clinical trial, we plan to initiate a phase 2/3 clinical trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, which will compare treatment with CA4P, bevacizumab and chemotherapy to treatment with bevacizumab and chemotherapy.
908259_16_ITEM1_P3_S3	CA4P is also being studied in combination with pazopanib (Votrient ) in an on-going phase 1b/2 clinical trial in recurrent ovarian cancer that is sponsored by The Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in the United Kingdom.
908259_16_ITEM1_P3_S4	Our second compound, OXi4503, is being studied in combination with cytarabine in a phase 1/2 clinical trial in the United States in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
908259_16_ITEM1_P3_S5	We have been granted orphan drug designation for CA4P for the treatment of ovarian cancer in the United States and the European Union, and for OXi4503 for the treatment of AML in the United States and the European Union.
908259_16_ITEM1_P3_S6	To date, we have observed CA4P to be well tolerated in over 450 patients and to have clinical activity in a variety of indications in addition to ovarian cancer.
908259_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	CA4P Development Program CA4P is a reversible tubulin binding agent that selectively targets the endothelial cells that make up the blood vessel walls in most solid tumors.
908259_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	which obstructs the flow of blood to the tumor and starves the tumor of vital nutrients including oxygen.
908259_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	This deprivation, also known as tumor hypoxia, results in rapid downstream tumor cell death.
908259_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	Although CA4P acts rapidly, within minutes of infusion, and its circulating half-life is approximately 4 hours, the swelling effect caused by CA4P on the endothelial cells generally lasts for several weeks.
908259_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	CA4P is given to patients via a 10 minute intravenous infusion.
908259_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our primary focus for 2016 will be the development of CA4P for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
908259_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	Ovarian Cancer Approximately 22,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year.
908259_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	This form of cancer begins in the ovaries and often spreads to the rest of the pelvis and abdomen prior to detection, resulting in a relatively poor prognosis.
908259_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	More than 60% of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer are in stage III or IV, making ovarian cancer difficult to treat and often fatal, with a five-year survival rate of approximately 45% a rate which is largely unchanged since the 1990s.
908259_16_ITEM1_P8_S3	Overall, approximately 80% of patients diagnosed with ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer will relapse after first-line platinum-based and taxane-based chemotherapy.
908259_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	When treating recurrent ovarian cancer, the time between receiving the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy and disease recurrence is used to help determine the choice of chemotherapy used in the next line of treatment.
908259_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	Patients are said to have platinum-resistant disease if the disease progresses within six months of completing platinum-based chemotherapy.
908259_16_ITEM1_P9_S2	One quarter of those who relapse after initial treatment, or more than 4,300 women, will have platinum-resistant cancer, the most difficult-to-treat form of the disease.
908259_16_ITEM1_P9_S3	Additionally, a majority of patients who are not initially platinum-resistant and who may achieve a full remission following first-line therapy will also develop recurrent disease.
908259_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	There are relatively few cancer therapies that have been approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer including platinum-resistant cancer.
908259_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	Approved drugs include bevacizumab, carboplatin and cisplatin, gemcitabine, doxorubicin, paclitaxel and olaparib.
908259_16_ITEM1_P10_S2	Many patients eventually become resistant to platinum-based therapies, and new treatment agents are needed.
908259_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	Due to the unmet need in the treatment of ovarian cancer and the small size of the indication in terms of number of patients, we have been granted an orphan drug designation in both the U.S. and the European Union for the use of CA4P in the treatment of ovarian cancer.
908259_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	CA4P in Combination with Bevacizumab Completed Phase 2 Clinical Trial with Positive Results Genentech s bevacizumab is an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, monoclonal antibody which has been approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer in the United States and elsewhere.
908259_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	The GOG-0186I clinical trial was conducted by the GOG, now part of NRG Oncology, under the sponsorship of the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and was a randomized, two-arm phase 2 clinical trial evaluating CA4P plus bevacizumab compared to bevacizumab alone in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.
908259_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	The GOG-0186I clinical trial enrolled a total of 107 patients with both platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer at 67 clinical sites in the United States.
908259_16_ITEM1_P13_S2	The results indicated a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival (PFS) in the combination arm, which was the primary endpoint of the trial, with a p-value of 0.049 (pre-specified analysis using a one-sided test; 10% level of significance).
908259_16_ITEM1_P13_S3	The hazard ratio was 0.685, with a 90% 2-sided confidence interval (CI) of 0.47 ~1.00.
908259_16_ITEM1_P13_S4	Median PFS was 7.3 months for CA4P plus bevacizumab (n=54), compared to 4.8 months for bevacizumab alone (n= 53).
908259_16_ITEM1_P13_S5	Patients in both arms were treated until disease progression or adverse effects prohibited further therapy.
908259_16_ITEM1_P13_S6	In a post-hoc subgroup analysis, data showed that patients who were platinum-resistant had an even greater improvement in PFS with the combination.
908259_16_ITEM1_P13_S7	Among the 27 patients who were platinum-resistant, median PFS was 6.7 months for those receiving CA4P plus bevacizumab compared to 3.4 months for those receiving bevacizumab alone, and the results were statistically significant with a p-value of 0.01 and a hazard ratio of 0.57.
908259_16_ITEM1_P13_S8	These findings suggest that adding CA4P to bevacizumab has a greater effect in the difficult-to-treat platinum-resistant patient group than it does for platinum-sensitive patients.
908259_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	CA4P plus bevacizumab compared to 6.1 months for those receiving bevacizumab alone, although the results were not statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.139 and a hazard ratio of 0.67.
908259_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	In the clinical trial, patients with measurable disease who received the combination of CA4P and bevacizumab also achieved a higher objective response rate, or ORR, a secondary endpoint in the clinical trial, measured according to RECIST criteria.
908259_16_ITEM1_P14_S2	Although not a statistically significant result, patients receiving the combination had an ORR of 35.7% (n=42; CI 90% 23.5 ~ 49.5%) compared to 28.2% for patients on bevacizumab alone (n=39; CI 90% 16.7 ~ 42.3%).
908259_16_ITEM1_P14_S3	In the subgroup of platinum-resistant patients, the addition of CA4P to bevacizumab increased ORR to 40.0% (n=10) compared to 12.5% (n=8) for bevacizumab alone.
908259_16_ITEM1_P14_S4	Additional secondary endpoints in the clinical trial included safety and overall survival.
908259_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	All adverse events in the clinical trial were manageable, with one Grade 4 event occurring in each treatment arm.
908259_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	Consistent with prior clinical experience with CA4P, patients in the combination arm experienced an increased incidence of Grade 3 hypertension compared to the control arm (18 cases for the combination compared to 10 cases for bevacizumab alone).
908259_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	One patient on the combination regimen had a Grade 3 thromboembolic event.
908259_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	All cases of hypertension were managed with anti-hypertensive treatments, as specified in the clinical trial protocol.
908259_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	Patients continue to be followed for overall survival (OS).
908259_16_ITEM1_P16_S2	A preliminary analysis after 33 events did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in OS between the clinical trial arms; however, these OS data were not sufficiently mature to yield any meaningful conclusions.
908259_16_ITEM1_P16_S3	Further analyses of this secondary endpoint will be conducted as the data matures.
908259_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	The approval of bevacizumab in the U.S. in combination with chemotherapy (paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or topotecan) for the treatment of women with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer was based on results from the phase 3 AURELIA trial, which had a primary endpoint of PFS.
908259_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	Bevacizumab is also approved in the EU in combination with different chemotherapy regimens for platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, and the EU approvals were also based on PFS.
908259_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	CA4P in Combination with Bevacizumab and Physician s Choice Chemotherapy Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial Planned Based on the positive overall results from the GOG-0186I clinical trial in recurrent ovarian cancer and also the statistically significant results among the subgroup of platinum-resistant patients, we plan to initiate the FOCUS Study, a phase 2/3 clinical trial of CA4P seeking to demonstrate whether CA4P improves the current standard of care for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
908259_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	The current standard of care for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is treatment with bevacizumab and chemotherapy.
908259_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	The clinical trial is designed with two stages in the first stage we plan to enroll up to 80 patients and conduct regular interim analyses in order to verify efficacy and confirm powering assumptions for the second stage.
908259_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	In the second stage, we plan to enroll up to 356 additional patients and do not plan to conduct any interim analyses.
908259_16_ITEM1_P19_S2	The primary endpoint of our phase 2/3 clinical trial will be PFS, and we will also evaluate overall response rate, overall survival and other parameters.
908259_16_ITEM1_P19_S3	If results from the second stage of the clinical study meet the primary endpoint, we intend to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA.
908259_16_ITEM1_P19_S4	We expect to begin enrolling patients into this clinical trial during the second quarter of 2016.
908259_16_ITEM1_P19_S5	CA4P in Combination with Pazopanib Ongoing Phase 1b Clinical Trial moving into Phase 2 Pazopanib is an anti-angiogenic oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and soft tissue sarcoma (STS).
908259_16_ITEM1_P19_S6	Pazopanib is also approved for ovarian and other cancers in the European Union, and was initially developed by GlaxoSmithKline, then sold to Novartis in 2015.
908259_16_ITEM1_P19_S7	We believe that using CA4P in combination with pazopanib may provide a clinically active yet potentially better tolerated alternative to the current standard of care, cytotoxic chemotherapy, for relapsed ovarian cancer.
908259_16_ITEM1_P19_S8	In October 2014, the first patient was enrolled in a phase 1b/2 trial of pazopanib with and without CA4P in advanced recurrent ovarian cancer.
908259_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Coordination Unit, or MAHSC-CTU, with additional support from The University of Manchester, the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and Mount Vernon Cancer Centre (part of the East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust).
908259_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	The trial design consists of a phase 1b dose escalation portion with the combination of pazopanib and CA4P, which has been completed, and then a randomized phase 2 portion comparing pazopanib alone versus pazopanib plus CA4P in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer.
908259_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	The clinical trial is expected to enroll approximately 128 patients at sites in the U.K.
908259_16_ITEM1_P21_S2	The primary endpoint of the trial is PFS, and secondary endpoints include safety, overall survival, objective response rate, and CA125 response rate.
908259_16_ITEM1_P21_S3	The phase 2 portion is expected to begin enrolling patients in the second quarter of 2016.
908259_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	Approximately 14,000 patients in the U.S. are diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumors, or NETs, each year.
908259_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	Since patients with NETs can have prolonged survival rates of over 5 years, it is estimated that the overall prevalence is much higher, approximating 100,000 patients in the U.S.
908259_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	These tumors can produce increased amounts of vasoactive substances including hormones, many of which are biologically active and can result in debilitating symptoms including flushing, diarrhea, weight loss and, less frequently, bronchoconstriction and heart failure.
908259_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	It is our belief, based on the available preclinical data, that by reducing blood flow to these highly vascular tumors using CA4P, we may be able to reduce the production of tumor-derived substances, including the biologically active hormones.
908259_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	We are completing a phase 2 monotherapy clinical trial of CA4P in 18 patients with gastrointestinal or pancreatic NETs and elevated biomarkers.
908259_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	The primary endpoint of the trial is a reduction in biomarkers, and secondary endpoints include symptom control and changes in quality of life as assessed by validated measures.
908259_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	We estimate that initial data from the trial will be available by the third quarter of 2016.
908259_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	We have been granted orphan drug designation for CA4P for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors in the United States and the European Union.
908259_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	Glioblastoma Multiforme We are exploring recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM, as an additional indication for CA4P because:
908259_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	rapid enrollment would be expected in clinical trials for this indication.
908259_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	If funds become available for us to initiate and complete a clinical trial in GBM, we expect that we would pursue such a trial, with a similar two-stage phase 2/3 design in combination with bevacizumab as we are pursuing in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
908259_16_ITEM1_P26_S2	However, we currently do not plan to initiate a GBM clinical trial in the near term in order to conserve current resources.
908259_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer, or ATC We have previously conducted a randomized, controlled clinical trial in ATC.
908259_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	ATC is one of the most aggressive tumors known and has very few treatment options.
908259_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	Results of the FACT Study, which combined CA4P with chemotherapy and which, in 2010, we terminated early (after 75 patients were enrolled) due to slow enrollment, showed a numerical improvement in overall survival for the CA4P group (5.2 months) compared to the control group (4.0 months), although the results were not statistically significant.
908259_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	improvement in overall response rate for the CA4P group (20.0%) compared to the control group (16.0%), although these results were not statistically significant either.
908259_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	We believe the numerical improvements shown for the CA4P group compared to the control group provide supportive evidence for the potential benefit of CA4P against this tumor type, and for the overall potential of CA4P against other highly vascular solid tumors.
908259_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma, or NSCLC We have previously conducted a randomized, controlled clinical trial in NSCLC.
908259_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	NSCLC accounts for most cases of lung cancer, and generally does not respond well to chemotherapy.
908259_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	Results of the FALCON Study, completed in 2011, which enrolled 63 patients and combined CA4P with both bevacizumab and chemotherapy, showed a numerical improvement in overall response rate for the CA4P group (56.3%) compared to the control group (35.5%), although the results were not statistically significant.
908259_16_ITEM1_P30_S2	This clinical trial enrolled chemotherapy-na ve patients, which are patients who have not yet received chemotherapy, which we believe contributed to the high dropout rate among both treatment groups (46.8% and 38.7% for CA4P and control, respectively), making evaluation of progression free survival, the primary endpoint, difficult.
908259_16_ITEM1_P30_S3	However, we believe the numerical improvements in response rates shown for the CA4P group compared to the control group provide supportive evidence for the potential benefit of CA4P against this tumor type, and for the overall potential of CA4P against other highly vascular solid tumors.
908259_16_ITEM1_P30_S4	In addition to pursuing development of CA4P, we are also pursuing the development of a second product candidate, OXi4503, a novel, dual-mechanism VDA, which not only has been shown to reduce tumor blood flow but which also forms a potentially anti-proliferative metabolite.
908259_16_ITEM1_P30_S5	We believe that this dual mechanism of OXi4503 may result in enhanced anti-tumor activity in certain tumor types.
908259_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	Based on preclinical data, we believe that OXi4503 may be particularly active in hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, and leukemias of the myeloid lineage, all of which have relatively high levels of the enzymes that facilitate the conversion of OXi4503 into a metabolite that directly kills tumor cells.
908259_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	Similar to CA4P, OXi4503 has shown potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies of solid tumors and AML, and in two clinical studies in advanced solid tumors and liver tumors, both as a single agent and in combination with other anti-proliferative agents.
908259_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	Acute Myeloid Leukemia AML is a relatively rare cancer of the myeloid blood cells, with approximately 10,500 new cases each year in the United States and accounting for approximately 1.2% of cancer deaths.
908259_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	AML is characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that pollute bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells.
908259_16_ITEM1_P32_S2	Due to an unmet need in the treatment of AML and the small size of the indication, we have been granted orphan drug designation in the United States and European Union for the use of OXi4503 for the treatment of AML.
908259_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	Prior to October 2015, OXi4503 had been in development in an investigator-sponsored phase 1 clinical trial of patients with AML or MDS, a disorder of the normal blood formation process, being conducted at the University of Florida and with support by The Leukemia Lymphoma Society s Therapy Acceleration Program.
908259_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	This open-label, dose-escalating clinical trial was intended to treat up to 36 patients and evaluate the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose and biologic activity of OXi4503 in these patients.
908259_16_ITEM1_P33_S2	Through October 2015, 18 patients had been enrolled into this clinical trial and a maximum tolerated dose had not been observed.
908259_16_ITEM1_P33_S3	In October 2015, the investigator-sponsored clinical trial was closed, and we brought the clinical trial under our direct management and expanded the number of sites to four, with the goal of enrolling patients faster than had occurred at a single site.
908259_16_ITEM1_P33_S4	In December 2015, we moved this clinical trial into its second stage, whereby OXi4503 is being used in combination with cytarabine, an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of AML.
908259_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	Data from the investigator-sponsored trial was presented at the December 2013 annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, in New Orleans, Louisiana.
908259_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	Among the first 13 patients treated at the two lowest dose levels, two patients showed stable disease, one patient had a partial remission and one patient achieved a complete bone marrow response.
908259_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	that is released when a blood clot breaks up), bone pain, fever, chills and flu-like symptoms.
908259_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	Accordingly, OXi4503 appears to be reasonably well-tolerated based on these results to date in patients with relapsed and refractory AML and MDS.
908259_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	Biological activity associated with OXi4503 includes temporary increases in D-dimer which may be related to anti-leukemic activity of the drug.
908259_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	According to Cancer Research UK, a non-profit cancer research organization in the United Kingdom, nearly 90% of all cancers are solid tumors that are dependent upon a continually evolving vascular supply for their growth and survival.
908259_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	VTTs, which include AAs and VDAs, are designed to interfere with a tumor s vascular supply.
908259_16_ITEM1_P37_S2	AAs are drugs that interfere with tumor blood vessel growth, as described further in the table below, and since 2004, a number have been approved for a variety of cancer indications.
908259_16_ITEM1_P37_S3	Development of AAs for new indications continues, and physician adoption of AAs has been rapid.
908259_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	VDAs are drugs that interfere with existing tumor blood vessels.
908259_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	Although a number of VDAs have been in clinical development, to date none have been approved.
908259_16_ITEM1_P38_S2	We believe that the historical focus on development of VDAs as a single agent, rather than as an agent for use in combination with an AA, is the primary reason that VDA development to date has generally not been successful.
908259_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	While VDAs such as CA4P deprive tumors of blood supply, as do AAs, the mechanism of action of VDAs is quite different than that of AAs.
908259_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	VDAs such as CA4P have a direct effect on existing tumor blood vessels, and act by rapidly obstructing the blood supply to cancer tumors.
908259_16_ITEM1_P39_S2	AAs, on the other hand, act by preventing the formation of new blood vessels to cancer tumors.
908259_16_ITEM1_P39_S3	We believe that our VDA drug candidates and approved AAs are complementary to each other in that one agent destroys existing tumor vasculature and the other prevents new tumor vasculature from forming.
908259_16_ITEM1_P39_S4	We intend for substantially all of our future CA4P development to be focused on this combination, rather than pursuing CA4P approval as a single therapy.
908259_16_ITEM1_P39_S5	We believe our VDAs are a second generation of VTTs that have the potential to improve upon the efficacy of AAs, the first generation of VTTs.
908259_16_ITEM1_P39_S6	Our belief in the synergy of CA4P and AAs is supported by the data we have gathered showing an improvement in certain patient outcomes when both agents are used in combination.
908259_16_ITEM1_P39_S7	Several preclinical studies, as well as the results of the phase 2 GOG-0186I clinical trial, have confirmed the potential of this approach.
908259_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	As illustrated in the table below, VDA and anti-angiogenic drugs act via different mechanisms to produce complementary biological and anti-vascular effects with mostly non-overlapping side effects.
908259_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	In preclinical studies, VDA plus anti-angiogenic drug combinations demonstrate robust and additive anti-tumor effects.
908259_16_ITEM1_P40_S2	Results from initial human clinical trials conducted by us with combinations of CA4P and bevacizumab provide support and initial clinical validation for combining these agents to significantly increase clinical activity without significantly increasing side-effects.
908259_16_ITEM1_P40_S3	Additionally, positive study results from the phase 2 GOG-0186I clinical trial indicated a statistically significant increase in PFS in patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer with the combination of CA4P and bevacizumab.
908259_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	Chronic hypertension with long-term use; Acute-impairment in wound healing; Hemorrhage, hemoptysis, gastrointestinal perforation, proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, thromboembolic events, etc.
908259_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	Transient acute blood pressure increases; Tumor pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue; Effects on hematopoiesis and white blood cell counts; In AML similar to solid tumors with more pronounced effects on coagulation and hematopoiesis We believe our VDA drug candidates act on tumor blood vessels via two complementary mechanisms, tubulin depolymerization and disengagement of the junctional protein VE-cadherin, which cause a change in the shape of tumor vascular endothelial cells, tumor vessel occlusion and collapse, and the subsequent blockage of blood-flow to the tumor, which deprives the tumor of oxygen and nutrients essential for survival.
908259_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	By binding to the tubulin, CA4P is able to collapse the structural framework that normally maintains the cells flat shape.
908259_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	When this occurs, the shape of the cells changes from flat to round, initiating a cascade of events resulting in physical blockage of the blood vessels.
908259_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	The resulting shutdown in blood-flow then deprives tumor cells of the oxygen and nutrients necessary for maintenance and growth and also prevents tumor cells from being able to excrete toxic metabolic waste products.
908259_16_ITEM1_P43_S3	The consequence of the blockage is extensive tumor cell death, as demonstrated in animal studies and suggested in imaging studies of human patients treated with CA4P and OXi4503.
908259_16_ITEM1_P43_S4	Preclinical research, published in the November 2005 issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation, showed that CA4P also disrupts the molecular engagement of VE-cadherin, a junctional protein important for endothelial cell survival and function.
908259_16_ITEM1_P43_S5	The authors of the research article conclude that this effect only occurs in endothelial cells which lack contact with smooth muscle cells, a known feature of abnormal vasculature associated with tumors and other disease processes.
908259_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	The disengagement of VE-cadherin leads to endothelial cell detachment, which in turn, can cause permanent physical blockage of vessels.
908259_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Preclinical and clinical study results indicate that CA4P exerts anti-vascular effects rapidly, within hours of administration, and the half-life of the active form of CA4P in humans is approximately four hours.
908259_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	In part because the half-life of the active form of CA4P is relatively short, the effects of CA4P on tubulin are reversible, and CA4P is typically administered no more frequently than once per week.
908259_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	The side-effects of CA4P are typically transient in nature, limited to the period of time following administration when the active form of CA4P is in the body in significant concentrations.
908259_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	This contrasts with AAs, which are typically administered on a chronic basis so as to constantly maintain levels of drug in the body.
908259_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	Currently approved AAs generally exert their tumor blood-vessel growth inhibiting effects over days to weeks to months, and as a result can cause a variety of chronic side-effects that are not limited to the immediate period following administration.
908259_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	Side-effects associated with CA4P are generally transient and manageable.
908259_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	The most frequent CA4P side-effects include acute blood pressure increases, infusion-related side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache and fatigue, and tumor pain, which is consistent with the drug s mechanism-of-action.
908259_16_ITEM1_P48_S2	Approximately 10-20% of patients treated with CA4P experience clinically-significant acute blood pressure increases, which are often manageable by controlling underlying hypertension or treating with short-acting anti-hypertensives prior to CA4P infusion.
908259_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	The incidence of serious cardiovascular side-effects such as angina and myocardial ischemia observed across all studies to date (including early studies in which hypertension management and prevention was not employed) was less than 3%, a frequency comparable to that reported with approved anti-angiogenic agents such as bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib.
908259_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our strategy is to develop innovative therapeutics for oncology, with a larger goal of ultimately transforming vascular targeted therapies to include VDAs in order to improve patient outcomes.
908259_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our principal focus is to advance the clinical development of our drug candidates, CA4P and OXi4503, and to identify new preclinical candidates that are complementary to our VDAs.
908259_16_ITEM1_P50_S2	To help advance our strategy, we have established relationships with universities, research organizations and other institutions in these fields.
908259_16_ITEM1_P50_S3	We intend to continue to rely on these relationships, rather than expand our in-house research and development staff.
908259_16_ITEM1_P50_S4	In general, these programs are created, developed and controlled by our internal management.
908259_16_ITEM1_P50_S5	Currently, we have collaborative agreements and arrangements with a number of institutions in the United States and abroad, which we utilize to perform the day-to-day activities associated with drug discovery and/or development.
908259_16_ITEM1_P50_S6	In 2015, collaborations and agreements were ongoing with a variety of universities and research institutions, including the following:
908259_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	For rights to CA4P, we have secured a technology license from Arizona State University, or ASU.
908259_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	The ASU license is an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license for commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including among others, CA4P and OXi4503.
908259_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	Combretastatins were originally isolated from the bark of the South African Bush Willow tree by researchers from Arizona State University but are now created by synthetic means and have tubulin-dependent anti-vascular and anti-proliferative properties.
908259_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	Under the ASU license, we have the right to grant sublicenses.
908259_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	ASU is entitled to single-digit royalty and milestone payments under the license agreement.
908259_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	We bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the ASU license.
908259_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	Under the license agreement, we have agreed to diligently proceed with the development, manufacture and sale of products using the licensed technology.
908259_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	ASU has the first responsibility of enforcing patents under the license agreement.
908259_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	Either party may terminate the license agreement upon material default or bankruptcy of the other party.
908259_16_ITEM1_P55_S2	In addition, we may terminate the agreement by either (i) determining that filing for regulatory approval is not warranted by the clinical testing date or (ii) by providing two months written notice of our intent to terminate the agreement.
908259_16_ITEM1_P55_S3	Payments made to ASU to date have amounted to $2,700,000.
908259_16_ITEM1_P55_S4	The agreement remains in force until the expiration of the last to expire patent subject to the ASU license.
908259_16_ITEM1_P55_S5	Either party may terminate the ASU license agreement upon material default or bankruptcy of the other party.
908259_16_ITEM1_P55_S6	In addition, we may terminate the agreement by either (i) determining that filing for regulatory approval is not warranted or economically feasible by the clinical testing date or (ii) by providing two months written notice of our intent to terminate the agreement.
908259_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	Under a sponsored research agreement with Baylor University, we are pursuing discovery and development of additional novel, small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, including small-molecule cathepsin-L inhibitors and hypoxia-activated VDAs.
908259_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	Cathepsin-L is an enzyme involved in protein degradation and has been shown to be closely involved in the processes of angiogenesis and metastasis.
908259_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	Small molecule inhibitors may have the potential to slow tumor growth and metastasis in a manner we believe could be complementary with our VDA therapeutics.
908259_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	We believe that our hypoxia-activated VDAs could serve as line-extension products to fosbretabulin and/or OXi4503.
908259_16_ITEM1_P58_S2	We also have an exclusive license from Baylor University to all novel compositions developed for the treatment of vascular disorders, inflammation, parasitic diseases and infections, fungal diseases and infections and/or cancer.
908259_16_ITEM1_P58_S3	We have the right to grant sublicenses under the Baylor license.
908259_16_ITEM1_P58_S4	The agreement with Baylor stipulates that low-single-digit royalties will be paid by us should sales be generated through use of Baylor s compounds.
908259_16_ITEM1_P58_S5	Further, commencing in the first year that we provide no research funding to Baylor University we must pay a minimum annual royalty payment of $40,000.
908259_16_ITEM1_P58_S6	We are not required to pay Baylor for use of Baylor s compounds other than pursuant to this royalty arrangement.
908259_16_ITEM1_P58_S7	We are entitled to file, prosecute and maintain patent applications on products for which we have a license under this agreement.
908259_16_ITEM1_P58_S8	We have made a one-time payment of $50,000 for the licensing fee that was used as a credit against research expenses generated by Baylor.
908259_16_ITEM1_P58_S9	Either party may terminate the license agreement upon material default of the other party.
908259_16_ITEM1_P58_S10	The term of the license shall end upon the expiration of the licensed patents.
908259_16_ITEM1_P58_S11	The latest U.S. patent licensed under this agreement is scheduled to expire in November 2030.
908259_16_ITEM1_P58_S12	We also have an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, for commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including among others, CA4P. Under the BMS license, we have the right to grant sublicenses, and BMS is entitled to low single-digit royalty payments for all commercial sales plus any remuneration we receive for sale of CA4P under named patient or compassionate use programs.
908259_16_ITEM1_P58_S13	All licensing fees and milestone payments under the BMS license, in the aggregate amount of $1,080,000, have been paid.
908259_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the BMS license and have a right, but not a duty, of enforcing patents covered by the license.
908259_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	Either party may terminate the BMS license upon material default of the other party.
908259_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	The term of the BMS license shall end upon the expiration of the licensed patents.
908259_16_ITEM1_P59_S3	The latest United States patent licensed under the BMS license is scheduled to expire in December 2021, excluding a patent term extension available under the Hatch-Waxman Act.
908259_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	In June 2012, we secured a royalty-bearing, transferable, worldwide, exclusive license from Angiogene Pharmaceuticals Ltd., or Angiogene, to make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, and sell a vascular disrupting agent, such as CA4P, for treating neuroendocrine tumors and associated symptoms and syndromes.
908259_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	Under the Angiogene license, we have the right to grant sublicenses.
908259_16_ITEM1_P60_S2	Angiogene is entitled to low single-digit royalty payments and milestone payments under the agreement.
908259_16_ITEM1_P60_S3	Milestone payments are due upon initiation of the first clinical trial for a product using Angiogene intellectual property and initiation of the first registration clinical trial for a product using Angiogene intellectual property.
908259_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	We have the sole right to and bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the Angiogene license.
908259_16_ITEM1_P61_S1	Payments to Angiogene under this license to date have amounted to $375,000.
908259_16_ITEM1_P61_S2	The term of the royalty payable under the license will expire on the sooner of (i) ten years from the regulatory approval of a product subject to the license or (ii) launch by a third party of a generic version of the vascular disrupting agent.
908259_16_ITEM1_P61_S3	After the expiry of the royalty term, the license will become fully paid, irrevocable and perpetual.
908259_16_ITEM1_P61_S4	Either party may terminate the license upon material default of the other party, and we may terminate the agreement at will upon sixty days prior notice to Angiogene.
908259_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	We are a Delaware corporation, originally incorporated in 1988 in the state of New York and reincorporated in 1992 in the state of Delaware, with our principal corporate office in the United States at 701 Gateway Boulevard, Suite 210, South San Francisco, California 94080 (telephone: (650) 635-7000, fax: (650) 635-7001).
908259_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, are available to you free of charge through the Investors Media section of our web site as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
908259_16_ITEM1_P62_S2	Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our web site is not and shall not be deemed to be a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. REGULATORY MATTERS Government Regulation and Product Approval Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing.
908259_16_ITEM1_P62_S3	Our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application, or NDA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States.
908259_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations.
908259_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
908259_16_ITEM1_P63_S2	Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions.
908259_16_ITEM1_P63_S3	These sanctions could include the FDA s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusal of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties.
908259_16_ITEM1_P63_S4	Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
908259_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
908259_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA.
908259_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
908259_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage.
908259_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies.
908259_16_ITEM1_P66_S2	An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND.
908259_16_ITEM1_P66_S3	The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation.
908259_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	Preclinical testing continues even after the IND is submitted.
908259_16_ITEM1_P67_S1	The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold.
908259_16_ITEM1_P67_S2	In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.
908259_16_ITEM1_P67_S3	Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
908259_16_ITEM1_P67_S4	All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations.
908259_16_ITEM1_P67_S5	These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
908259_16_ITEM1_P67_S6	Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution.
908259_16_ITEM1_P67_S7	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
908259_16_ITEM1_P67_S8	The IRB also approves the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
908259_16_ITEM1_P67_S9	Each new clinical protocol must be submitted to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval.
908259_16_ITEM1_P67_S10	Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and efficacy in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.
908259_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
908259_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
908259_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
908259_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	Phase 2: Involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate preliminary efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
908259_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
908259_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling.
908259_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	During the development of a new drug, sponsors may, under certain circumstances request a special protocol assessment, or SPA, from the FDA.
908259_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	For example, a sponsor may request an SPA of a protocol for a clinical trial that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in an NDA.
908259_16_ITEM1_P72_S2	The request, which must be made prior to commencing the trial, must include the proposed protocol and protocol-specific questions that the sponsor would like the FDA to answer regarding the protocol design, clinical trial goals and data analysis for the proposed investigation.
908259_16_ITEM1_P72_S3	After receiving the request, the FDA will consider whether the submission is appropriate for an SPA.
908259_16_ITEM1_P72_S4	If an SPA is appropriate, the FDA will base its assessment on the questions posed by the sponsor.
908259_16_ITEM1_P72_S5	Comments from the FDA review team are supposed to be sent to the sponsor within 45 calendar days of receipt of the request.
908259_16_ITEM1_P72_S6	The sponsor may request a meeting to discuss the comments and any remaining issues and uncertainties regarding the protocol.
908259_16_ITEM1_P72_S7	If the sponsor and the FDA reach agreement regarding the protocol, the agreement will be documented and made part of the administrative record.
908259_16_ITEM1_P72_S8	This agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins, except (1) with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or (2) if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began.
908259_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA.
908259_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	IND Safety Reports must be submitted to the FDA, IRBs and the investigators for (a) any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected; (b) any findings from epidemiological studies, pooled analysis of multiple trials, or clinical trials(other than those already reported in (a)); (c) any findings from animal or in vitro testing, whether or not conducted by the sponsor, that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug, such as reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure; and (d) any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
908259_16_ITEM1_P73_S2	Phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
908259_16_ITEM1_P73_S3	The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
908259_16_ITEM1_P73_S4	Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
908259_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
908259_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug.
908259_16_ITEM1_P74_S2	Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
908259_16_ITEM1_P74_S3	The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product.
908259_16_ITEM1_P74_S4	The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances, which may include orphan drug status and the first NDA application for a company.
908259_16_ITEM1_P74_S5	In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective.
908259_16_ITEM1_P74_S6	The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
908259_16_ITEM1_P74_S7	Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
908259_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing.
908259_16_ITEM1_P75_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing.
908259_16_ITEM1_P75_S2	In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information.
908259_16_ITEM1_P75_S3	The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
908259_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
908259_16_ITEM1_P76_S1	The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
908259_16_ITEM1_P76_S2	The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
908259_16_ITEM1_P76_S3	The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information.
908259_16_ITEM1_P76_S4	Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
908259_16_ITEM1_P76_S5	Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
908259_16_ITEM1_P76_S6	The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA.
908259_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product s identity, strength, quality and purity.
908259_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.
908259_16_ITEM1_P78_S1	The FDA will also inspect selected clinical sites that participated in the clinical studies and may inspect the testing facilities that performed the GLP toxicology studies cited in the NDA.
908259_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	NDAs receive either standard or priority review.
908259_16_ITEM1_P79_S1	A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review.
908259_16_ITEM1_P79_S2	In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
908259_16_ITEM1_P79_S3	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials.
908259_16_ITEM1_P79_S4	Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process.
908259_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
908259_16_ITEM1_P80_S1	In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized.
908259_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	Orphan Drug Designation Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug.
908259_16_ITEM1_P81_S1	Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA.
908259_16_ITEM1_P81_S2	After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
908259_16_ITEM1_P81_S3	Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
908259_16_ITEM1_P81_S4	If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years.
908259_16_ITEM1_P81_S5	Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor s product for the same indication or disease.
908259_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	In the European Union and Japan, orphan drug exclusivity regulations provide for 10 years of marketing exclusivity for orphan drugs that are approved for the treatment of rare diseases or conditions.
908259_16_ITEM1_P83_S0	CA4P has been awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of anaplastic, medullary, Stage IV papillary and Stage IV follicular thyroid cancers, ovarian cancer and neuroendocrine tumors.
908259_16_ITEM1_P83_S1	OXi4503 has been awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia.
908259_16_ITEM1_P83_S2	CA4P has also been awarded orphan drug status by the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer, ovarian cancer and gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
908259_16_ITEM1_P83_S3	OXi4503 has been awarded orphan drug status by the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia.
908259_16_ITEM1_P84_S0	Expedited Review and Approval The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints.
908259_16_ITEM1_P84_S1	Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may subsequently decide the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the FDA may not shorten the review or approval time period.
908259_16_ITEM1_P84_S2	Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments.
908259_16_ITEM1_P85_S0	Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied.
908259_16_ITEM1_P85_S1	Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review.
908259_16_ITEM1_P86_S0	Drugs that receive an accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect of a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
908259_16_ITEM1_P86_S1	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials.
908259_16_ITEM1_P87_S0	In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products.
908259_16_ITEM1_P87_S1	Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of any product candidate in those countries.
908259_16_ITEM1_P87_S2	The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
908259_16_ITEM1_P87_S3	The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
908259_16_ITEM1_P88_S0	Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAAs, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.
908259_16_ITEM1_P88_S1	The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders or diabetes and optional for those medicines which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states.
908259_16_ITEM1_P88_S2	The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions.
908259_16_ITEM1_P89_S0	Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states.
908259_16_ITEM1_P89_S1	Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval.
908259_16_ITEM1_P89_S2	If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
908259_16_ITEM1_P90_S0	As in the United States, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, may grant orphan drug status for specific indications if the request is made before an MAA is made.
908259_16_ITEM1_P90_S1	The EMA considers an orphan medicinal product to be one that affects less than five of every 10,000 people in the European Union.
908259_16_ITEM1_P90_S2	A company whose application for orphan drug designation in the European Union is approved is eligible to receive, among other benefits, regulatory assistance in preparing the marketing application, protocol assistance and reduced application fees.
908259_16_ITEM1_P90_S3	Orphan drugs in the European Union also enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication, unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product.
908259_16_ITEM1_P91_S0	Reimbursement Sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations.
908259_16_ITEM1_P91_S1	These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for health care products and services.
908259_16_ITEM1_P92_S0	The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products.
908259_16_ITEM1_P92_S1	Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue.
908259_16_ITEM1_P92_S2	If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
908259_16_ITEM1_P93_S0	The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposes requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries.
908259_16_ITEM1_P93_S1	Under Part D (the Medicare prescription drug benefit), Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs not covered under Medicare Part B. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs.
908259_16_ITEM1_P94_S0	Each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level.
908259_16_ITEM1_P94_S1	Federal regulations require Part D prescription drug formularies to include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, although not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class.
908259_16_ITEM1_P95_S0	In general, government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval.
908259_16_ITEM1_P95_S1	However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.
908259_16_ITEM1_P95_S2	Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.
908259_16_ITEM1_P95_S3	Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA or other Medicare regulations may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
908259_16_ITEM1_P96_S0	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Affordable Care Act or ACA,) was enacted in March 2010 and has had a significant impact on the health care industry.
908259_16_ITEM1_P96_S1	The ACA mandated prescription drug coverage as one of ten essential health benefits that most health plans must offer, requiring coverage of at least one drug in every category and class.
908259_16_ITEM1_P96_S2	The ACA also expanded coverage for the uninsured through the new health insurance exchanges and a significant increase in the number of individuals eligible for Medicaid coverage.
908259_16_ITEM1_P96_S3	The ACA also prevents health insurers from charging more, denying, or limiting coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions (i.e. individuals whose health care costs are typically higher).
908259_16_ITEM1_P96_S4	Because of the significant increase in the number of individuals covered and the expansion of the coverage that must be provided to them, commercial insurers and government programs have increased their emphasis on cost controls to reduce overall spending.
908259_16_ITEM1_P96_S5	For example, the ACA expanded and increased mandatory industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid.
908259_16_ITEM1_P97_S0	Pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide drug rebates to the federal government and most state governments in order to have the product eligible for Medicaid coverage.
908259_16_ITEM1_P97_S1	In addition, commercial insurers offering Medicaid managed care products seek to negotiate additional rebates.
908259_16_ITEM1_P98_S0	The ACA also made changes to the drug coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program.
908259_16_ITEM1_P98_S1	Although the changes have not yet been enacted, the Center for Medicine Services, or CMS, has proposed decreasing the number of categories and classes of drugs Part D plan sponsors must cover.
908259_16_ITEM1_P98_S2	Because of these cost controls, it is hard to determine what impact the ACA s expansion in coverage might have on pharmaceutical companies.
908259_16_ITEM1_P98_S3	We expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of health care costs, including the cost of prescription drugs, while at the same time increasing access to health care services.
908259_16_ITEM1_P99_S0	At the present time, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies for drugs.
908259_16_ITEM1_P99_S1	There have been legislative proposals seeking to allow such direct negotiation.
908259_16_ITEM1_P99_S2	It is possible that the adoption of other legislative or regulatory proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_16_ITEM1_P100_S0	In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed.
908259_16_ITEM1_P101_S0	The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.
908259_16_ITEM1_P101_S1	For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.
908259_16_ITEM1_P101_S2	A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.
908259_16_ITEM1_P101_S3	There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
908259_16_ITEM1_P102_S0	Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
908259_16_ITEM1_P103_S0	We actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including chemical species, compositions and forms, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, as well as modified forms of naturally-expressed receptors, in the United States and other jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets.
908259_16_ITEM1_P103_S1	We also rely upon trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information.
908259_16_ITEM1_P103_S2	As of March 23, 2016, we were the exclusive licensee, sole assignee or co-assignee of thirty (30) granted U.S. patents, two (2) pending U.S. patent applications, and granted patents and/or pending applications in several other major markets, including the European Union, Canada and Japan.
908259_16_ITEM1_P103_S3	Our policy is to file U.S. and foreign patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business.
908259_16_ITEM1_P103_S4	There can be no assurance that any of these patent applications will result in the grant of a patent either in the United States or elsewhere, or that any patents granted will be valid and enforceable, or will provide a competitive advantage or will afford protection against competitors with similar technologies.
908259_16_ITEM1_P103_S5	We also intend to rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel drugs.
908259_16_ITEM1_P103_S6	We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements.
908259_16_ITEM1_P103_S7	We consider the following U.S. patents and applications owned by or exclusively licensed to us to be particularly important to the protection of our most advanced product candidates.
908259_16_ITEM1_P104_S0	In-licensed from Angiogene Pharmaceuticals Ltd.; patent filed, awaiting grant In addition to these patents, for some of our product candidates, we have patents and/or applications that cover a particular form or composition, use for a particular indication, use as part of combination therapy or method of preparation or use, as well as other pending patent applications.
908259_16_ITEM1_P104_S1	These issued patents, including any patents that issue from pending applications, could provide additional or a longer period of protection.
908259_16_ITEM1_P104_S2	We also have patent applications pending that seek equivalent or substantially comparable protection for our product candidates in jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets.
908259_16_ITEM1_P105_S0	The patent expiration dates referenced above do not reflect any potential patent term extension that we may receive under the federal Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
908259_16_ITEM1_P105_S1	The Hatch-Waxman Act generally permits a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
908259_16_ITEM1_P105_S2	Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years.
908259_16_ITEM1_P106_S0	The patent term restoration period is generally one-half of the time between the effective date of an investigational new drug application, or IND, and the submission date of a new drug application, or NDA, plus the time between the submission date and approval date of an NDA.
908259_16_ITEM1_P106_S1	Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent.
908259_16_ITEM1_P107_S0	The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for patent term extension.
908259_16_ITEM1_P108_S0	COMPETITION The industry in which we are engaged is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition.
908259_16_ITEM1_P108_S1	Our competitors include, among others, major pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, many of which have financial, technical and marketing resources significantly greater than ours.
908259_16_ITEM1_P108_S2	In addition, many of the small companies that compete with us have also formed collaborative relationships with large, established companies to support research, development, clinical trials and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours.
908259_16_ITEM1_P108_S3	Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or through joint ventures or other collaborations.
908259_16_ITEM1_P109_S0	We are aware of a limited number of companies currently or previously involved in the development of VDAs.
908259_16_ITEM1_P109_S1	Such companies include Bionomics, Angiogene, Immune Pharmaceuticals, and MediciNova, all of which have VDAs that we believe are at an earlier stage of clinical development than our lead drug candidate, CA4P.
908259_16_ITEM1_P109_S2	We expect that, if any of our products gain regulatory approval for sale, they will compete primarily on the basis of product efficacy, safety, patient convenience, reliability, price and patent protection.
908259_16_ITEM1_P109_S3	Our competitive position will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop effective proprietary products and implement joint ventures or other alliances with large pharmaceutical companies in order to jointly market and manufacture our products.
908259_16_ITEM1_P109_S4	EMPLOYEES We expect to continue to maintain a relatively small number of executives and other employees.
908259_16_ITEM1_P109_S5	We rely on outsourcing for much of our research, development, preclinical testing and clinical trial activity, although we maintain managerial and quality control over our clinical trials.
908259_16_ITEM1_P109_S6	As of March 23, 2016, we had a total of 15 full-time employees.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	statements that may be made by us or by officers, directors or employees acting on our behalf, that are not historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from the historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors set forth below.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We will be required to raise additional funds to finance our operations and continue the development of our product candidates; we may not be able to do so when necessary, and/or the terms of any financings may not be advantageous to us.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Negative cash flows from our operations are expected to continue over at least the next several years.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Our cash utilization amount is highly dependent on product development programs we choose to pursue, the progress of these product development programs, the results of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory decisions regarding potential approval for our product candidates, the terms and conditions of our contracts with service providers for these programs, and the rate of recruitment of patients in our human clinical trials.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	In addition, the further development of our ongoing clinical trials will depend on upcoming analysis and results of those studies and our financial resources at that time.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P2_S5	We are pursuing forms of capital infusion including public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements with organizations that have capabilities, products and/or resources that are complementary to or could further extend our own capabilities, products or resources, in order to continue the development of our product candidates.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P2_S6	However, there can be no assurances that we will complete any financings, strategic alliances or collaborative development agreements, and the terms of such arrangements may not be advantageous to us.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Based on our current operating plans, we expect our existing cash to support our operations into approximately the third quarter of 2017.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P2_S8	We expect that our planned level of cash utilization will allow us to advance our ongoing programs, including completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of CA4P in patients with recurrent gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors with elevated biomarkers; the completion of the dose escalation portion of an open-label Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of OXi4503 in combination with cytarabine in patients with AML; supporting a Phase 1b/2 trial of CA4P in relapsed ovarian cancer in combination with pazopanib, which is being sponsored by two UK-based nonprofit organizations; and initiation and continuation of a phase 2/3 clinical trial of CA4P in combination with bevacizumab and chemotherapy in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P2_S9	Any significant further clinical development of CA4P, including the completion of the planned Phase 2/3 clinical trial of CA4P in ovarian cancer, and of OXi4503 would be contingent upon our ability to raise additional capital through public or private financings or from one or more new collaborative research or license agreements with a third-party, as to which we can give you no assurance.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Our ongoing capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including the progress and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates under development; the costs of complying with U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other regulatory agency requirements; the progress of our research and development programs; the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals; our ability to enter into licensing arrangements, including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs; the costs and expenses of filing, prosecuting and, if necessary, enforcing our patent claims, or defending against possible claims of infringement by third-party patent or other technology rights; the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, if any, undertaken by us; and, if and when approved, the demand for our products, which demand depends in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known, understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval, including the range of indications for which any product is granted approval.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P2_S11	If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we will not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we will be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs or cease operations.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P2_S12	We may seek to raise funds through public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P2_S13	Any additional equity or convertible debt financing may be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish, on terms that are not favorable to us, rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our failure to raise capital when needed will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our ability to raise additional capital could also be further impaired if our common shares lose their status on The NASDAQ Capital Market.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We currently do not meet the continued listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market, which requires a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share, which could result in our delisting and negatively impact the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	NASDAQ provides various continued listing requirements that a company must meet in order for its stock to continue trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Among these requirements is the requirement that the Company s stock trades at a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Our stock has recently traded below $1.00 per share, including closing bid prices below $1.00 per share.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S5	On December 1, 2015 we received a deficiency letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market which provided us a grace period of 180 calendar days, or until May 31, 2016, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, which would require a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S6	The NASDAQ letter also stated that we may be provided an additional 180 day compliance period if we demonstrate that we meet the applicable market value of publicly held shares requirement for continued listing and all other applicable standards for initial listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market (except the bid price requirement), and provide written notice of our intention to cure the minimum bid price deficiency during the second grace period, including by implementation of a reverse stock split, if necessary.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S7	If we fail to qualify for the second grace period or fail to regain compliance during the second grace period, our stock will be subject to delisting by NASDAQ.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S8	Additionally, if we fail to comply with any other continued listing standards of NASDAQ, our common stock will also be subject to delisting.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S9	If that were to occur, our common stock would be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S10	The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S11	This would significantly negatively affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would significantly negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S12	These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S13	Also, if we seek to implement a reverse stock split in order to remain listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, the announcement and/or implementation of a reverse stock split could significantly negatively affect the price of our common stock.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S14	Due in part to our limited financial resources, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates or those that are in-licensed, and/or we may be unable to pursue and complete the clinical trials that we would like to pursue and complete.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S15	We have limited technical, managerial and financial resources to determine the indications on which we should focus the development efforts related to our product candidates.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S16	Due to our limited available financial resources, we have curtailed clinical development programs and activities that might otherwise have led to more rapid progress of our product candidates through the regulatory and development processes.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S17	Further, our planned clinical trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is expected to be larger than any other clinical trial that we have conducted previously.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S18	We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient financial resources to complete the trial, even if we are able to initiate it.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S19	We may make incorrect determinations with regard to the indications and clinical trials on which to focus the available resources that we do have.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S20	Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S21	We or our partners currently are pursuing clinical trials in various indications, but we are required by our financial resources to engage only in limited clinical activities.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S22	The decisions to allocate our research, management and financial resources toward particular indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S23	Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate drug development programs may also cause us to miss valuable opportunities.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S24	In addition, from time to time, we may in-license or otherwise acquire product candidates to supplement our internal development activities.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S25	Those activities may use resources that otherwise would have been devoted to our internal programs.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P4_S26	We cannot assure you that any resources that we devote to acquired or in-licensed programs will result in any products that are superior to our internally developed products.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	If we are unable to obtain required regulatory approvals, we will be unable to market and sell our product candidates.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to development, clinical trials, manufacturing, oversight of clinical investigators, recordkeeping and commercialization.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory review and approval process are required to be successfully completed in the United States, in the European Union and in many other foreign jurisdictions before a new drug can be sold.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain, and subject to unanticipated delays.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The time required to obtain approval by the FDA or the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is unpredictable and often exceeds five years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the complexity of the product candidate.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In connection with the clinical development of our product candidates, we face risks that:
908259_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	the results from clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance or clinical benefit-to-risk ratio required by the FDA, EMA or other regulatory agencies for marketing approval.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Only a small percentage of product candidates for which clinical trials are initiated are the subject of NDAs and even fewer receive approval for commercialization.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Furthermore, even if we do receive regulatory approval to market a product candidate, any such approval may be subject to limitations such as those on the indicated uses for which we may market the product.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	We may seek orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates in additional indications, and we may be unsuccessful.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	To date, we have been granted orphan drug designation for CA4P for the treatment of ovarian cancer and for OXi4503 for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia, or AML, in the United States and the European Union.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the EMA or the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication during the period of exclusivity.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in the European Union.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or the EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective, if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product candidate, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product candidate from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve a different drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	If we or the third parties on which we rely for the conduct of our clinical trials and results do not perform our clinical trial activities in accordance with good clinical practices and related regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We currently use independent clinical investigators in all of our clinical trials and, in many cases, also utilize contract research organizations, or CROs, and other third-party service providers to conduct and/or oversee the clinical trials of our product candidates and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Nonetheless, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the FDA s requirements and our general investigational plan and protocol.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Currently, we have clinical trial activities involving CA4P and OXi4503 being conducted by clinical investigators who are independent of us, but with whom we have agreements for them to provide the results of their clinical trials to us.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P11_S5	In order for us to rely on data from these ongoing clinical trials in support of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for approval of any of our product candidates by the FDA or similar types of marketing applications that are required by other regulatory authorities, the independent investigators are required to comply with applicable good clinical practice requirements.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P11_S6	The FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities require us and our clinical investigators to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting and recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or the respective trial plans and protocols.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P11_S9	The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates or result in enforcement action against us.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In February 2012, we were inspected by the FDA, and in March 2012, we received a Form FDA 483 containing observations from that inspection.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The Form FDA 483 noted observations of certain GCP deficiencies in the conduct of our FACT Study in ATC, which was conducted from July 2007 to February 2010.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	These observations included the failure to ensure proper monitoring of third-party clinical investigators who were participants in our FACT Study, the failure to promptly bring non-compliant clinical investigators into compliance.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The FDA also found that some of the clinical trial monitors selected by our CROs outside the United States were not sufficiently qualified by experience and training to monitor clinical trials.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P12_S4	The Form FDA 483 also included observations related to the failure to address the improper storage of a drug that was being used in the trial, and the failure to maintain records and case histories in compliance with FDA regulations.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The issues noted in the Form FDA 483 had previously been identified and addressed by our management as part of an internal review of our systems, practices and procedures governing the areas of vendor oversight, quality, and regulatory compliance.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our response to the Form FDA 483 described the corrective actions that we had taken and will continue to take in response to this matter.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	On February 10, 2014, we received correspondence from the FDA informing us that we appeared to have taken corrective action to prevent the recurrence of the conditions that led to the issuance of the Form FDA 483 and that the related inspection was closed.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	While we have taken and continue to take steps to strengthen our procedures in order to ensure that these and similar issues will not recur in any future clinical trials sponsored by us for any of our product candidates, we cannot assure you that the FDA will be satisfied with our procedures, and that the FDA will not issue additional 483 observations or warning letters or take other enforcement action against us in the future.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P13_S4	The steps we take to strengthen our procedures and conduct future clinical trials necessary for approval will be time-consuming and expensive.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may encounter difficulties in expanding our operations successfully if and when we evolve from a company that is primarily involved in clinical development to a company that is also involved in commercialization.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	As we advance our product candidates through later stages of clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with such third parties, as well as additional collaborators, distributors, marketers and suppliers.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Maintaining third party relationships for these purposes will impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management and other personnel.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We must be able to manage our development efforts effectively, manage our participation in the clinical trials in which our product candidates are involved effectively, and improve our managerial, development, operational and finance systems, all of which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P14_S5	If, following any approval of our product candidates, we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing or distribution services, any product revenues that we receive, or the profitability of these product revenues to us, are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P14_S6	In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our products or in doing so on terms that are favorable to us.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P14_S7	We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P14_S8	If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our products.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P14_S9	If we were to submit an NDA for our drug candidates in the United States or a marketing application in the EU, we would need to undertake commercial scale manufacturing activities at significant expense to us in order to proceed with the application for approval for commercialization.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P14_S10	We or our external vendors may encounter technical difficulties that preclude us from successfully manufacturing the required registration and validation batches of active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and/or drug product and we may be unable to recover any financial losses associated with the manufacturing activities.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P14_S11	Further, our research or product development efforts may not be successfully completed, any compounds currently under development by us may not be successfully developed into drugs, any potential products may not receive regulatory approval on a timely basis, if at all, and competitors may develop and bring to market products or technologies that render our potential products obsolete.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P14_S12	If any of these problems occur, our business would be materially and adversely affected.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P14_S13	We have no manufacturing capacity and have relied on, and expect to continue to rely on, third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P14_S14	We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates or any of the compounds that we are testing in our preclinical programs, and we lack the resources and the capabilities to do so.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P14_S15	As a result, we currently rely, and we expect to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party manufacturers to supply our product candidates.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P14_S16	Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our product candidates or products ourselves, including:
908259_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	the possible termination or non-renewal of the manufacturing agreements by the third-party, at a time that is costly or inconvenient to us.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	regulatory approval for our products and substantially increase our costs or deplete profit margins, if any.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	If we do find replacement manufacturers, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us, and there could be a substantial delay before new facilities could be qualified and registered with the FDA, EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The FDA, EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities require manufacturers to register manufacturing facilities.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The FDA and corresponding foreign regulators also inspect these facilities to confirm compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Contract manufacturers may face manufacturing or quality control problems causing drug substance production and shipment delays or a situation where the contractor may not be able to maintain compliance with the applicable cGMP requirements.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Any failure to comply with cGMP requirements or other FDA, EMA and comparable foreign regulatory requirements could adversely affect our clinical research activities and our ability to develop our product candidates and market our products after approval.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our ability to develop our product candidates, our ability to commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval and our potential future profit margins on these products.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Our product candidates have not completed clinical trials, and may never demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in order to do so.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Our product candidates are in the clinical stage of development.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P17_S7	In order to achieve profitable operations, we alone or in collaboration with others, must successfully develop, manufacture, introduce and market our products.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P17_S8	The time frame necessary to achieve market success for any individual product is long and uncertain.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P17_S9	The products currently under development by us may require significant additional research and development and additional preclinical and clinical testing prior to application for commercial use.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	A number of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after showing promising results in early or later-stage studies or clinical trials.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Although we have obtained some favorable results to date in preclinical studies and clinical trials of certain of our potential products, such results may not be indicative of results that will ultimately be obtained in or throughout such clinical trials, and clinical trials may not show any of our products to be safe or capable of producing a desired result.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Additionally, we may encounter problems in our clinical trials that may cause us to delay, suspend or terminate those clinical trials.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our product candidates have been tested in over 450 patients to date, and adverse events associated with CA4P and OXi4503 have been found to be mainly low grade, reversible, transient and manageable.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P18_S4	However, we will be required to continue to test and evaluate the safety of our product candidates in additional clinical trials, and to demonstrate their safety to the satisfaction of appropriate regulatory agencies, as a condition to receipt of any regulatory approvals.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In clinical trials to date, transient mild to moderate hypertension believed to be associated with CA4P and OXi4503 has been effectively managed through pre-treatment with anti-hypertensive medication.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to make the necessary demonstrations of safety to allow us to receive regulatory approval for our product candidates in any indication.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We only have a limited number of employees to manage and operate our business.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	As of March 23, 2016, we had a total of 15 full-time employees.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our focus on reducing cash utilization requires us to manage and operate our business in a highly efficient manner.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We have a history of losses, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We have experienced net losses every year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2015, had an accumulated deficit of over $264 million.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We anticipate continuing to incur substantial additional losses over at least the next several years due to, among other factors, our continuing clinical trials and development activities with respect to our VDA drug candidates, technologies, and anticipated research and development activities and the general and administrative expenses associated with those activities.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our ability to attain profitability will depend upon our ability to develop and commercialize products that are effective and commercially viable, to obtain regulatory approval for the manufacture and sale of our products and to license or otherwise market our products successfully.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We depend on our executive officers and principal consultants and the loss of their services could materially harm our business.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We believe that our success depends, and will likely continue to depend, upon our ability to retain the services of our current executive officers, principal consultants and others.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P21_S4	In addition, we have established relationships with universities, hospitals and research institutions, which have historically provided, and continue to provide, us with access to research laboratories, clinical trials, facilities and patients.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Additionally, we believe that we may, at any time and from time to time, materially depend on the services of consultants and other unaffiliated third parties.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P21_S6	We cannot assure you that consultants and other unaffiliated third parties will provide the level of service to us that we require in order to achieve our business objectives.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Our industry is highly competitive, and our product candidates may become obsolete.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P21_S8	We are engaged in a rapidly evolving field.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P21_S9	Competition from other pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and research and academic institutions is intense and likely to increase.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P21_S10	Many of those companies and institutions have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P21_S11	Many of those companies and institutions also have substantially greater experience in developing products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and in manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P21_S12	Our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for competitive products.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We are aware of at least four other companies that currently have a clinical-stage VDA for use in an oncology indication.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Some of these competitive products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing the desired therapeutic effect than products being developed by us.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Our competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective and/or cost competitive than those we are developing, or that would render our product candidates less competitive or even obsolete.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In addition, one or more of our competitors may achieve product commercialization or patent protection earlier than we do, which could materially adversely affect us.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P23_S4	We depend extensively on the patents and proprietary technology we license from others, and we must maintain these licenses in order to preserve our business.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P23_S5	We have licensed in rights to CA4P, OXi4503 and other programs from third parties.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P23_S6	If our license agreements terminate or expire, we may lose the licensed rights to our product candidates, including CA4P and OXi4503, and we may not be able to continue to develop them or, if they are approved, we may not be able to market or commercialize them.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P23_S7	We depend on license agreements with third-parties for certain intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates, including patent rights.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P23_S8	Currently, we have licensed in certain patent rights from Arizona State University, or ASU, and the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company for CA4P and OXi4503, with Angiogene Pharmaceuticals Ltd. for certain uses of CA4P and OXi4503, and from Baylor University for other programs.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P23_S9	In general, our license agreements require us to make payments and satisfy performance obligations in order to keep these agreements in effect and retain our rights under them.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P23_S10	These payment obligations can include upfront fees, maintenance fees, milestones, royalties, patent prosecution expenses, and other fees.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P23_S11	These performance obligations typically include diligence obligations.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P23_S12	If we fail to pay, be diligent or otherwise perform as required under our license agreements, we could lose the rights under the patents and other intellectual property rights covered by the agreements.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P23_S13	While we are not currently aware of any dispute with any licensors under our material agreements with them, if disputes arise under any of our in-licenses, including our in-licenses from ASU, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Baylor University and Angiogene Pharmaceuticals Ltd., we could lose our rights under these agreements.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P23_S14	Any such dispute may not be resolvable on favorable terms, or at all.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P23_S15	Whether or not any disputes of this kind are favorably resolved, our management s time and attention and our other resources could be consumed by the need to attend to and seek to resolve these disputes and our business could be harmed by the emergence of such a dispute.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	If we lose our rights under these agreements, we may not be able to conduct any further activities with the product candidate or program that the license covered.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If this were to happen, we might not be able to develop our product candidates further, or following regulatory approval, if any, we might be prohibited from marketing or commercializing them.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In particular, patents previously licensed to us might after termination be used to stop us from conducting these activities.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P24_S3	We depend extensively on our patents and proprietary technology and patents and proprietary technology we license from others, and we must protect those assets in order to preserve our business.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Although we expect to seek patent protection for any compounds we discover and/or for any specific use we discover for new or previously known compounds, any or all of them may not be subject to effective patent protection.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Further, the development of regimens for the administration of pharmaceuticals, which generally involve specifications for the frequency, timing and amount of dosages, has been, and we believe, may continue to be, important to our effort, although those processes, as such, may not be patentable.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In addition, the issued patents may be declared invalid or our competitors may find ways to avoid the claims in the patents.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, protect our trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are the exclusive licensee, sole assignee or co-assignee on a number of granted United States patents, pending United States patent applications, and granted patents and/or pending applications in several other major markets, including the European Union, Canada and Japan.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms like us is generally highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions, resulting in both an apparent inconsistency regarding the breadth of claims allowed in United States patents and general uncertainty as to their legal interpretation and enforceability.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Accordingly, patent applications assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not result in patents being issued, any issued patents assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not provide us with competitive protection or may be challenged by others, and the current or future granted patents of others may have an adverse effect on our ability to do business and achieve profitability.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Moreover, because some of the basic research relating to one or more of our patent applications and/or patents were performed at various universities and/or funded by grants, one or more of these universities, employees of such universities and/or grantors could assert that they have certain rights in such research and any resulting products.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Further, others may independently develop similar products, may duplicate our products, or may design around our patent rights.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P27_S4	In addition, as a result of the assertion of rights by a third-party or otherwise, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of others in or outside of the United States.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Any licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights may not be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P27_S6	If we do not obtain such licenses, we could encounter delays in product market introductions while our attempts to design around such patents or could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is foreclosed.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P27_S7	In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against us or in connection with patents to which we hold licenses or in bringing suit to protect our own patents against infringement.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P27_S8	We require employees and the institutions that perform our preclinical and clinical trials to enter into confidentiality agreements with us.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P27_S9	Those agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to a party to any such agreement during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third-parties, except in specific circumstances.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P27_S10	Any such agreement may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P27_S11	The use of our products may result in product liability exposure, and it is uncertain whether our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all claims.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P27_S12	The use of our product candidates in clinical trials may expose us to liability claims in the event such product candidates cause death, injury or disease, or result in adverse effects.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P27_S13	We may be exposed to liability claims even if our product did not cause death, injury or diseases, but is merely presumed or alleged to have caused any of these.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P27_S14	If our product candidates are ever commercially approved, the commercial use of these products may also expose us to similar liability claims.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P27_S15	Any of these claims could be made by health care institutions, contract laboratories, patients or others using such products.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	insurance coverage for our ongoing clinical trials, this coverage may not be in amounts sufficient to protect us from any product liability claims or product recalls which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Further, adverse product and similar liability claims could negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our technology and product candidates under development.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	If clinical trials or regulatory approval processes for our product candidates are prolonged, delayed or suspended, we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis, which would require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any revenue from potential product sales.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or any regulatory authority to delay or suspend those clinical trials or delay the analysis of data derived from them.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P28_S4	A number of events, including any of the following, could delay the completion of our other ongoing and planned clinical trials and negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and to market and sell, a particular product candidate:
908259_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	failure of our third-party contractors to comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise meet their contractual obligations to us.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed by the imposition of additional conditions on our clinical trials by the FDA, EMA or another foreign regulatory authority or the requirement of additional supportive clinical trials by the FDA, EMA or another foreign regulatory authority.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	In addition, clinical trials require sufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the conduct of other clinical trials that compete for the same patients as our clinical trials, and the eligibility criteria for our clinical trials.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Our failure to enroll patients in our clinical trials could delay the completion of the clinical trial beyond our expectations.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P29_S4	In addition, the FDA and EMA could require us to conduct clinical trials with a larger number of subjects than we have projected for any of our product candidates.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P29_S5	We may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in a timely or cost-effective manner.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P29_S6	Furthermore, enrolled patients may drop out of our clinical trials, which could impair the validity or statistical significance of the clinical trials.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P29_S7	We do not know whether our clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured, or will be completed on schedule, if at all.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P29_S8	Delays in our clinical trials will result in increased development costs for our product candidates, and our financial resources may be insufficient to fund any incremental costs.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P29_S9	In addition, if our clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be limited.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our product candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory review even if they receive marketing approval, and if we fail to comply with continuing regulations, we could lose these approvals and the sale of any approved commercial products could be suspended.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Even if we receive regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, and record keeping related to the product will remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA, EMA and other applicable domestic and foreign regulatory authorities or previously unknown problems with any approved product, manufacturer, or manufacturing process are discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:
908259_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	If physicians and patients do not accept our future products or if the market for indications for which any product candidate is approved is smaller than expected, we may be unable to generate significant revenue, if any.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Even if any of our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, and third-party payers.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Physicians may decide not to recommend our drugs for a variety of reasons including:
908259_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	ineffective marketing and distribution support of our products.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	If any of our product candidates is approved, but fails to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenue and our business would suffer.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The uncertainty associated with pharmaceutical reimbursement and related matters may adversely affect our business.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Market acceptance and sales of any one or more of our product candidates that we develop will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will cover and establish payment levels.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We cannot be certain that reimbursement will be available for any product candidates that we develop.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Also, we cannot be certain that reimbursement policies will not reduce the demand for, or the price paid for, our products.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If reimbursement is not available or is available on a limited basis, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidates that we develop.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	The legislation established Medicare Part D, which expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drug purchases by the elderly but provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	The MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The United States and several foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P37_S3	We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any products that we develop due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, ACA, became law in the U.S.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The goal of ACA is to reduce the cost of health care and substantially change the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	While we cannot predict what impact on federal reimbursement policies this legislation will have in general or on our business specifically, the ACA may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of, and the price we may charge for, any products we develop that receive regulatory approval.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We also cannot predict the impact of ACA on us as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions, which have not yet been fully implemented.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Our results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Global financial concerns have caused, and may continue to cause, extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P39_S3	A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P39_S4	We cannot currently anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P39_S6	Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our third-party CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P39_S7	Furthermore, we have little or no control over the security measures and computer systems of our third-party CROs and other contractors and consultants.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our programs.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	For example, the loss of clinical trial data for our product candidates could result in delays in our marketing approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating to our technology or product candidates, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Our employees, principal investigators, CROs and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P40_S4	We are exposed to the risk that our employees, principal investigators, CROs and consultants may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violate the regulations of the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such authorities; healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad; or laws that require the reporting of financial information or data accurately.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P40_S6	In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P40_S7	Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or creating fraudulent data in our preclinical studies or clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P40_S8	We have a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P40_S9	Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P40_S10	If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P40_S11	We, or the third parties upon whom we depend, may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P40_S12	Earthquakes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P40_S13	If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P40_S14	The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P40_S15	We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P40_S16	The price of our common stock is volatile, and is likely to continue to fluctuate due to reasons beyond our control.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P40_S17	The market price of our common stock has been, and likely will continue to be, highly volatile.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	market price of our common stock.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We cannot assure you that an investment in our common stock will not fluctuate significantly.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P41_S2	One or more of these factors could significantly harm our business and cause a decline in the price of our common stock in the public market.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Substantially all of the shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants have been registered for resale or are available for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and may be sold from time to time.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Such sales, as well as future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders, or the perception that sales may occur at any time, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and the trading price of our stock.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	If we cannot maintain effective controls and reliable financial reports, our business and operating results could be harmed.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P43_S2	For example, during the third quarter of 2013, our management determined that we had a material weakness related to the operation of our controls over financial reporting associated with a complex non-routine financing transaction in the second quarter of 2013.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P43_S3	We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework).
908259_16_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P43_S5	We continue to work on improvements to our internal controls over financial reporting; however, there can be no assurance that another material weakness will not occur in the future.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P43_S6	Any failure to implement and maintain controls over our financial reporting or difficulties encountered in the implementation of improvements in our controls, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P43_S7	Any failure to improve our internal controls over financial reporting or to address identified weaknesses in the future, if they were to occur, could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P43_S8	Issuance of additional equity securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P43_S9	We are currently authorized to issue up to 70,000,000 shares of our common stock and 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P43_S10	As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 26,545,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, and we had no shares of preferred stock outstanding.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P43_S11	As of December 31, 2015, we also had approximately 9,842,000 warrants and 2,031,000 options outstanding.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	To the extent that shares of common stock are issued or options and warrants are exercised, holders of our common stock will experience dilution.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	In addition, in the event of any future issuances of equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, holders of our common stock may experience dilution.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Moreover, our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Our board of directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, conversion rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or if we liquidate, dissolve or wind up our business and other terms.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P44_S4	If we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decrease.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P44_S5	Any provision permitting the conversion of any such preferred stock into our common stock could result in significant dilution to the holders of our common stock.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P44_S6	We also consider from time to time various strategic alternatives that could involve issuances of additional common stock, including but not limited to acquisitions and business combinations, but do not currently have any definitive plans to enter into any of these transactions.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, and you may not receive funds without selling your common stock.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, nor do we expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P45_S2	We currently intend to retain any future earnings, if any, to finance our operations and growth and, potentially, for future stock repurchases and, therefore, we have no plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Any future determination to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, any contractual restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your common stock in order to generate cash from your investment in OXiGENE, Inc.
908259_16_ITEM1A_P45_S5	You may not receive a gain on your investment when you sell our common stock and may lose the entire amount of your investment.
908259_16_ITEM1B_P0_S0	PROPERTIES OXiGENE s corporate headquarters is located in South San Francisco, California where we lease 5,275 square feet of general office space.
908259_16_ITEM1B_P0_S1	The lease for this space, as amended, expires on June 30, 2019.
908259_16_ITEM1B_P0_S2	We believe that these facilities will meet our needs for the foreseeable future.
908259_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Company s common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol OXGN .
908259_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices of our common stock (rounded to the nearest penny) on The NASDAQ Capital Market, as applicable, as reported by NASDAQ, for each quarterly period during the two most recent fiscal years.
908259_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of March 15, 2016, there were approximately 42 stockholders of record of the 26,544,934 outstanding shares of the Company s common stock.
908259_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	The Company has not declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock since its inception in 1988, and does not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
908259_16_ITEM5_P1_S2	The Company presently intends to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of its business.
908259_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	Information relating to compensation plans under which our equity securities are authorized for issuance is presented in Part III, Item 12 of this Form 10-K. Unregistered Sales of Securities None.
908259_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
908259_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or outcomes to be materially different from those anticipated and discussed herein.
908259_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	Important factors that we believe may cause such differences are discussed in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report and in the Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 section of this Annual Report.
908259_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	In assessing forward-looking statements contained herein, readers are urged to read carefully all Risk Factors and cautionary statements contained in this Annual Report.
908259_16_ITEM7_P0_S4	Further, we operate in an industry sector where securities prices are volatile and may be influenced by regulatory and other factors beyond our control.
908259_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of vascular disrupting agents, or VDAs, for the treatment of cancer.
908259_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	VDAs selectively target the vasculature of cancer tumors and obstruct a tumor s blood supply without disrupting the blood supply to normal tissues.
908259_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	Treatment with VDAs has been shown to lead to significant central tumor necrosis, which refers to the death of cancer cells.
908259_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	VDAs are in a class of drugs called vascular targeted therapies, or VTTs, which also includes anti-angiogenic agents, or AAs.
908259_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	Bevacizumab and other currently approved AA drugs work by preventing the growth of new blood vessels which can supply nutrients to tumor cells.
908259_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	We are seeking to realize the full potential of VTTs in oncology by using the combination of VDAs and AAs to treat cancer tumors.
908259_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	The aim of using a VDA and an AA in combination, is for the VDA to directly cut-off the blood supply to the interior of the tumor, while the AA indirectly inhibits angiogenesis, which is the process by which new blood vessels form and re-vascularize the tumor.
908259_16_ITEM7_P2_S4	Our current VDA development plans are focused on this combination so that the mechanism of action of each drug would complement that of the other disrupting tumor blood supply in two different ways instead of just one.
908259_16_ITEM7_P2_S5	We have two clinical stage investigational drugs, both VDAs, that we are currently developing CA4P and OXi4503.
908259_16_ITEM7_P2_S6	Our lead compound is CA4P. The largest clinical trial of CA4P conducted to date was a recent phase 2 clinical trial in recurrent ovarian cancer sponsored by the Gynecologic Oncology Group, or GOG, which was completed in 2014 and met its primary endpoint by demonstrating an improvement in progression-free survival for the patients who received CA4P. This trial, referred to as GOG-0186I, compared treatment with CA4P plus bevacizumab to treatment with bevacizumab alone.
908259_16_ITEM7_P2_S7	Based on the positive results of this clinical trial, we are initiating a phase 2/3 clinical trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, which will compare treatment with CA4P, bevacizumab and chemotherapy to treatment with bevacizumab and chemotherapy.
908259_16_ITEM7_P2_S8	CA4P is also being studied in combination with pazopanib in an on-going phase 1b/2 clinical trial in recurrent ovarian cancer that is sponsored by The Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in the United Kingdom.
908259_16_ITEM7_P2_S9	Our second compound, OXi4503, is being studied in combination with cytarabine in a phase 1/2 clinical trial in the United States in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
908259_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	We also brought in-house an on-going clinical trial of OXi4503 in AML that was previously being conducted by an investigator at a single site, and moved this trial into its combination treatment phase.
908259_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	In 2014 and earlier years, we focused our capital resources on completing clinical trials of CA4P for various indications and other work related to the development of this investigational drug candidate.
908259_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	These activities included supporting the CA4P ovarian cancer phase 2 clinical trial conducted by the GOG, the investigator-sponsored OXi4503 phase 1 clinical trial in AML, our distribution agreement for the compassionate use of CA4P in anaplastic thyroid cancer, or ATC, in Europe, and the manufacture of CA4P for subsequent clinical trials.
908259_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	We have also focused capital resources on completing our ATC trial, or the FACT Study, completing our non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, trial, or the FALCON Study, as well as completing other clinical trials, mostly using CA4P as a single agent, in solid tumors, NSCLC, head and neck cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, advanced gastrointestinal carcinoma and certain ocular indications.
908259_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
908259_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time we make such estimates.
908259_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from our estimates, judgments and assumptions.
908259_16_ITEM7_P4_S3	We periodically review our estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience.
908259_16_ITEM7_P4_S4	The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate.
908259_16_ITEM7_P4_S5	Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
908259_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles.
908259_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	We believe the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments are the following: Research and development expenses Research and development expenses consist of costs we incur for the development of our investigational drugs and for preclinical research activities.
908259_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
908259_16_ITEM7_P5_S3	Research and development expenses include salaries and benefits of employees, including associated stock-based compensation, payments to clinical investigators, drug manufacturing costs, laboratory supplies and facility costs.
908259_16_ITEM7_P5_S4	Clinical trial costs can be a significant component of our research and development expenses, and these can be difficult to accurately estimate.
908259_16_ITEM7_P5_S5	Included in clinical trial costs are fees paid to other entities that conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf, such as clinical research organizations, or CROs.
908259_16_ITEM7_P5_S6	We estimate clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions such as CROs and the actual clinical investigators.
908259_16_ITEM7_P5_S7	These estimates are based on actual time and expenses incurred by the CRO and the clinical investigators.
908259_16_ITEM7_P5_S8	Also included in clinical trial expenses are costs based on the level of patient enrollment into the clinical trial and the actual services performed under the related clinical trial agreement.
908259_16_ITEM7_P5_S9	Changes in clinical trial assumptions, such as the length of time estimated to enroll all patients, rate of screening failures, patient drop-out rates, number and nature of adverse event reports and the total number of patients enrolled can impact the average and expected cost per patient and the overall cost of the clinical trial.
908259_16_ITEM7_P5_S10	Based on patient enrollment reports and services provided, we may periodically adjust estimates for the clinical trial costs.
908259_16_ITEM7_P5_S11	If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed, the length of time for these services or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates.
908259_16_ITEM7_P5_S12	Although we have not experienced significant changes in our estimates of clinical trial accruals to date, investors should be aware that our planned clinical trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is expected to be larger than any other clinical trial that we have conducted previously.
908259_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Share-based compensation We record the estimated fair value of all share-based payments issued to employees and other service providers.
908259_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	The valuation of stock options is an inherently subjective process, since market values are not available for long-term, non-transferable stock options in our equity securities.
908259_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	Accordingly, we use a Black-Scholes option pricing model to derive an estimated fair value of the stock options which we issue.
908259_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires certain input assumptions, including the expected term of the options and the expected volatility of our common stock.
908259_16_ITEM7_P7_S3	Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value that we record for share-based payments that we issue.
908259_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	We determine the term of the options based on the simplified method, which averages the vesting period and the contractual life of the stock option.
908259_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	We determine the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term.
908259_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Black-Scholes option pricing model also requires assumptions for risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock, but we feel that these values are more objective and note that changes in these values do not have a significant impact on the estimated value of the options when compared to the volatility and term assumptions.
908259_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	We are also required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
908259_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	Accordingly, we perform a historical analysis of option awards that are forfeited prior to vesting, and record total stock option expense that reflects this estimated forfeiture rate.
908259_16_ITEM7_P9_S4	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 Research and Development expenses The table below summarizes the most significant components of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated and provides the amount and percentage change in these components (in thousands):
908259_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	In 2015 compared to 2014, total research and development expenses increased primarily due to higher external clinical trial costs related to the development of our VDAs as potential new treatments for cancer and higher employee-related costs resulting from additional personnel as we refocused the Company on clinical development.
908259_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	These increases were partially offset by lower drug manufacturing expenses since the drug product required for our 2015 clinical programs was manufactured in 2014.
908259_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	The increase in clinical studies expense for 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to contract research organization costs related to our ongoing clinical trials.
908259_16_ITEM7_P10_S3	Clinical studies expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations who conduct clinical trials on our behalf, patient and clinical site costs, laboratory costs and other services directly related to clinical trials.
908259_16_ITEM7_P10_S4	The increase in 2015 is primarily due to planning and preparation for our upcoming phase 2/3 of CA4P in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, fees paid to contract research organizations managing our CA4P NET phase 2 trial initiated in 2014, and to a lesser extent our OXi4503 AML phase 1b/2 trial that we brought in-house in 2015.
908259_16_ITEM7_P10_S5	Patient costs also contributed to the increase in clinical study costs as most of the CA4P NET phase 2 patient enrollment occurred in 2015.
908259_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Drug manufacturing expenses consist primarily of costs paid to third-party manufacturers for production of our investigational drugs.
908259_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	CA4P drug supply requirements in 2014.
908259_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Timing of drug manufacturing costs is variable and is impacted by the timing of when drug product is needed for clinical trials, product expiration or re-test requirements, potential regulatory filings and scheduling of production batches based on the drug manufacturer s generally long lead time requirements.
908259_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	The increase in consulting and professional services for 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to a full evaluation that we undertook of our entire CA4P program in 2015, including evaluation of various potential indications.
908259_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	Employee compensation and related expenses increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to our hiring of additional research and development personnel to support our current and planned clinical programs for CA4P and OXi4503.
908259_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	For the same reason, employee stock-based compensation increased in 2015 compared to 2014.
908259_16_ITEM7_P12_S4	Other expenses include facility related expenses and licensing fees which decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower licensing fees paid for rights to our drug product candidates.
908259_16_ITEM7_P12_S5	Because we plan to initiate a phase 2/3 clinical study of CA4P in platinum resistant ovarian cancer during the first half of 2016 and conduct additional clinical development of our investigational drugs, we expect research and development expenses to increase in 2016 as compared to 2015.
908259_16_ITEM7_P12_S6	General and administrative expenses The table below summarizes the most significant components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated and the amount and percentage change in these components (in thousands):
908259_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	For 2015 compared to 2014, total general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower consulting and professional services, and, to a lesser extent, lower employee costs.
908259_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	Employee compensation and related expenses decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to greater severance expense recorded in 2014.
908259_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	During 2014, our severance costs were related to the departure of our former CEO, and although there were severance costs related to another employee in 2015, the amount of those costs was lower.
908259_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	The decrease in employee severance costs for 2015 compared to 2014 was partially offset by higher compensation costs and related expenses due to our making several positions full time during 2015 that were less than full time in 2014.
908259_16_ITEM7_P13_S4	Changes in employee stock-based compensation were not significant between the periods presented.
908259_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Consulting and professional services expenses decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to reduced marketing, research and legal costs.
908259_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	Other expenses, which include facility related expenses and insurance expenses, decreased for 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower fees paid in several different areas, none of which were individually significant.
908259_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	Although general and administrative expenses decreased in 2015 compared to 2014, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in 2016 to support our planned increase in research and development, as well as for additional business development and investor relations efforts.
908259_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We are developing two investigational drugs, both VDAs, for the treatment of cancer and currently have no sources of revenue.
908259_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	We measure liquidity by the cash and other capital we have available to fund our operations, which are primarily focused on the advancement of our VDAs.
908259_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	To date, we have financed our operations principally through net proceeds received from the sale of equity, including $9.2 million in 2015 and $35.2 million in 2014, and at one point through a strategic development arrangement which concluded in 2009.
908259_16_ITEM7_P15_S3	We have experienced net losses in each year since our inception, and negative cash flow from operations in nearly every year also.
908259_16_ITEM7_P15_S4	As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of over $264 million, including a net loss of approximately $13.7 million in 2015, and cash of approximately $27.3 million, which we expect to be sufficient to fund our operations into the third quarter of 2017.
908259_16_ITEM7_P15_S5	We expect to continue to incur expenses, resulting in losses and negative cash flows from operations, over at least the next several years as we continue to develop our candidate drugs for the treatment of cancer.
908259_16_ITEM7_P15_S6	We expect to incur significant additional costs over at least the next several years as a result of our plans to develop VDAs for the treatment of cancer, including continuing our existing clinical trials as well as conducting new, additional clinical trials and anticipated research and development expenditures.
908259_16_ITEM7_P15_S7	We anticipate that our development will include continuing our current clinical trials as well as new clinical trials and additional research and development expenditures.
908259_16_ITEM7_P15_S8	We will require additional capital before we can complete all planned clinical trials and development of CA4P and OXi4503.
908259_16_ITEM7_P15_S9	Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
908259_16_ITEM7_P15_S10	If we are unable to access additional funds when needed, we may not be able to continue the development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and operations.
908259_16_ITEM7_P15_S11	Any additional equity financing, if available, may not be available on favorable terms, would most likely be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	If we are able to access funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own, on terms that are not favorable to us.
908259_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	We have filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, covering the sale from time to time of shares of our common stock and other securities, which may provide us the opportunity to raise funds when we consider it necessary or appropriate, at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of any such offering.
908259_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	However, pursuant to the instructions to Form S-3, we only have the ability to sell shares under the shelf registration statement, during any 12-month period, in an amount less than or equal to one-third of the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates.
908259_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_16_ITEM7_P17_S3	Our ability to raise additional capital could also be further impaired if we are unable to comply with the listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market and our stock trades elsewhere.
908259_16_ITEM7_P17_S4	The following table presents information regarding our non-cancelable contractual obligations, which consists of our facility lease, as of December 31, 2015:
908259_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Our primary drug development programs are based on a series of natural products called combretastatins.
908259_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	In August 1999, we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by Arizona State University, or ASU.
908259_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	This agreement was subsequently amended in June 2002.
908259_16_ITEM7_P18_S3	From the inception of the ASU license agreement through December 31, 2015, we have paid a total of $2,700,000 in connection with this license.
908259_16_ITEM7_P18_S4	The ASU license agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals.
908259_16_ITEM7_P18_S5	The ASU license agreement also provides for additional payments upon our election to develop certain additional compounds, as defined in the ASU license agreement.
908259_16_ITEM7_P18_S6	We are also required to pay royalties on future net sales of products associated with these patent rights.
908259_16_ITEM7_P18_S7	Either party may terminate the ASU license agreement upon material default or bankruptcy of the other party.
908259_16_ITEM7_P18_S8	In addition, we may terminate the agreement by either (i) determining that filing for regulatory approval is not warranted or economically feasible by the clinical testing date or (ii) by providing two months written notice of our intent to terminate the agreement.
908259_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	We also have an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, for the commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including CA4P. BMS granted this license to us in February of 2002 in connection with the termination of a prior research collaboration and license agreement by and between BMS and us.
908259_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	Under the BMS license, we have the right to grant sublicenses, and BMS is entitled to low-single-digit royalty payments for commercial sales of products related to these licensed patent rights plus any remuneration we receive for sale of CA4P under named patient or compassionate use programs.
908259_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	All licensing fees and milestone payments under the BMS license have been paid.
908259_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	We bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the BMS license and have a right, but not a duty, of enforcing patents covered by the license.
908259_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	Either party may terminate the BMS license upon material default of the other party.
908259_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	I TEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We have adopted an Investment Policy, the primary objectives of which are to preserve principal, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields while preserving principal.
908259_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	Although our investments are subject to credit risk, we follow procedures to limit the amount of credit exposure in any single issue, issuer or type of investment.
908259_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	Our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase.
908259_16_ITEM7_P21_S3	However, due to the generally conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration, we believe that interest rate risk is mitigated.
908259_16_ITEM7_P21_S4	Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in U.S. dollar accounts.
908259_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Although we may from time to time manufacture drugs and conduct trials and studies outside of the United States, we believe our exposure to foreign currency risk to be immaterial.
908259_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA See Item 15 for a list of our Financial Statements and Schedules and any supplementary financial information filed as part of this Annual Report.
908259_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	under the Exchange Act and report on the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
908259_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	and report the information we must disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
908259_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, identified in connection with the evaluation of such control that occurred during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
908259_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
908259_16_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework).
908259_16_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015.
908259_16_ITEM9A_P1_S5	This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
908259_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC.
908259_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud.
908259_16_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time.
908259_16_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.
908259_16_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Because we are not an accelerated filer, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, Ernst Young LLP was not required to issue an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting and, therefore, did not perform for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 an audit of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

908259_16_ITEM15_P5_S0	The following financial statements of OXiGENE, Inc.:
908259_16_ITEM15_P6_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of OXiGENE, Inc.
908259_16_ITEM15_P6_S1	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of OXiGENE, Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of comprehensive loss, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2015.
908259_16_ITEM15_P6_S2	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
908259_16_ITEM15_P6_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
908259_16_ITEM15_P6_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
908259_16_ITEM15_P6_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
908259_16_ITEM15_P6_S6	We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
908259_16_ITEM15_P6_S7	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
908259_16_ITEM15_P6_S8	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
908259_16_ITEM15_P7_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
908259_16_ITEM15_P7_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
908259_16_ITEM15_P7_S2	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of OXiGENE, Inc. at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
908259_16_ITEM15_P8_S0	OXiGENE, INC. Notes to Financial Statements December 31, 2015 1.
908259_16_ITEM15_P8_S1	Description of Business OXiGENE, Inc. ( OXiGENE or the Company ) is incorporated in the state of Delaware, and is a clinical-stage, biopharmaceutical company developing vascular disrupting agents ( VDAs ) to treat cancer.
908259_16_ITEM15_P8_S2	VDAs selectively target the vasculature of cancer tumors and obstruct a tumor s blood supply without disrupting the blood supply to normal tissues.
908259_16_ITEM15_P9_S0	We have two VDA drug candidates currently being tested in clinical trials, CA4P (combrestatin A4-phosphate, fosbretabulin tromethamine, fosbretabulin or ZYBRESTAT ) and OXi4503.
908259_16_ITEM15_P10_S0	OXiGENE is dedicated to leveraging its intellectual property and therapeutic development expertise to bring life-extending and life-enhancing medicines to patients.
908259_16_ITEM15_P11_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
908259_16_ITEM15_P11_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
908259_16_ITEM15_P12_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk The Company has no significant off balance sheet concentrations of credit risk.
908259_16_ITEM15_P12_S1	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash.
908259_16_ITEM15_P12_S2	The Company holds its cash at one financial institution.
908259_16_ITEM15_P13_S0	The Company discloses information on all assets and liabilities reported at fair value that enables an assessment of the inputs used in determining the reported fair values.
908259_16_ITEM15_P14_S0	A fair value hierarchy is established that prioritizes valuation inputs based on the observable nature of those inputs.
908259_16_ITEM15_P14_S1	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company did not hold any assets or liabilities subject to fair value measurement on a recurring basis.
908259_16_ITEM15_P15_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements are recorded and stated at cost.
908259_16_ITEM15_P15_S1	Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years, or the applicable lease term, whichever is less.
908259_16_ITEM15_P16_S0	The Company utilizes contract research organizations (CROs), independent clinical investigators, and other third-party service providers to assist with the execution of its clinical trials.
908259_16_ITEM15_P16_S1	The Company records costs for clinical trial activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced for each clinical trial, and includes these costs in accrued liabilities on its Balance Sheets and within research and development expenses on its Statements of Comprehensive Loss.
908259_16_ITEM15_P16_S2	Contracts for clinical trials vary significantly in length and are usually composed of a fixed management fee, variable indirect reimbursable costs, monthly costs and amounts owed on a per patient basis.
908259_16_ITEM15_P16_S3	The Company monitors both the activity and patient enrollment levels of each clinical trial to the extent possible through communication with each service provider, detailed invoice and task completion review, analysis of actual expenses against budget, pre-approval of any changes in scope, and review of contractual terms.
908259_16_ITEM15_P16_S4	As a result, accrued clinical trial expenses represent the Company s reasonably estimated contractual liability to outside service providers at any particular point in time.
908259_16_ITEM15_P16_S5	These estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the service providers as determined by actual patient enrollment levels and other variable activity costs.
908259_16_ITEM15_P17_S0	Research and Development Expenses The Company charges all research and development costs, both internal and external, to expense when incurred.
908259_16_ITEM15_P17_S1	The Company s research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations (CROs), costs associated with manufacturing the Company s drug product for clinical use and required regulatory filings, licenses and fees, and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facility-related costs.
908259_16_ITEM15_P17_S2	Clinical study and manufacturing costs are significant components of the Company s research and development expenses.
908259_16_ITEM15_P17_S3	A large portion of the costs for the Company s clinical trials are paid to or through third-party CROs.
908259_16_ITEM15_P18_S0	The Company monitors levels of services provided under each significant contract including the extent of patient enrollment and other activities through communications with its CROs.
908259_16_ITEM15_P18_S1	Costs are accrued for clinical studies performed by CROs over the service periods specified in the contracts and estimates are adjusted, if required, based upon ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs.
908259_16_ITEM15_P19_S0	The manufacturing of the Company s drug product is outsourced to third-party manufacturers.
908259_16_ITEM15_P19_S1	The cost of the drug product is expensed as manufactured.
908259_16_ITEM15_P19_S2	All material CRO and manufacturing contracts are terminable by the Company upon written notice and amounts paid in advance related to uncompleted services will generally be refunded to the Company.
908259_16_ITEM15_P19_S3	For the periods presented, there are no components of other comprehensive income or accumulated comprehensive income and net loss is equal to comprehensive loss.
908259_16_ITEM15_P20_S0	Stock-based Compensation The Company expenses the estimated fair value of all share-based payments issued to employees on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
908259_16_ITEM15_P21_S0	The Company has an equity incentive plan that provides for the award of stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights to employees, directors and consultants to the Company.
908259_16_ITEM15_P22_S0	The Company has filed applications for patents in connection with various product candidates and technologies being developed.
908259_16_ITEM15_P22_S1	Costs associated with patent applications and maintaining patents are expensed as general and administrative expense as incurred.
908259_16_ITEM15_P23_S0	Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method whereby tax rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes based on when and how they are expected to affect the tax return.
908259_16_ITEM15_P23_S1	The Company reviews all activity subsequent to year end but prior to the issuance of the financial statements for events that could require disclosure or which could impact the carrying value of assets or liabilities as of the balance sheet date.
908259_16_ITEM15_P24_S0	Property and equipment Property and equipment consists of the following (in thousands):
908259_16_ITEM15_P25_S0	Stockholders Equity March 2015 Financing On March 25, 2015, the Company completed a financing with institutional investors in which it raised $10.0 million, or approximately $9.2 million after deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses.
908259_16_ITEM15_P25_S1	Investors purchased shares of the Company s common stock at a price of $1.7125 per share and received one warrant to purchase one half of a share of the Company s common stock at the same exercise price per share as each share of common stock purchased.
908259_16_ITEM15_P25_S2	A total of 5,839,420 shares of common stock and warrants for the purchase of 2,919,710 shares of common stock were issued.
908259_16_ITEM15_P25_S3	The warrants were exercisable immediately after issuance and expire 5 years from the date of issuance.

908259_16_ITEM15_P28_S0	Warrants The following is a summary of the Company s outstanding common stock warrants:
908259_16_ITEM15_P29_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014, investors exercised 3,857,000 warrants for the purchase of 3,857,000 shares of the Company s common stock for net proceeds of approximately $9.5 million.
908259_16_ITEM15_P29_S1	No warrants were exercised during the year ended December 31, 2015.
908259_16_ITEM15_P29_S2	All warrants outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were recorded by the Company as equity at the time of issuance.
908259_16_ITEM15_P30_S0	Options and restricted stock On May 28, 2015, the Company s stockholders approved the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan ).
908259_16_ITEM15_P30_S1	Under the 2015 Plan, up to 4,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock may be issued pursuant to awards granted in the form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted and unrestricted stock awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, consultants, and directors.
908259_16_ITEM15_P30_S2	The 2015 Plan also allows additional shares of the Company s common stock to be issued if awards outstanding under the Company s 2005 Stock Plan (the 2005 Plan ) are cancelled, forfeited, surrendered, or terminated after the April 25, 2015 expiration of the 2005 Plan, provided that no more than 725,781 shares of the Company s common stock shall be added to the 2015 Plan from the 2005 Plan.
908259_16_ITEM15_P31_S0	The following is a summary of the Company s stock option activity under its 2015 and 2005 Plans: As of December 31, 2015 there was approximately $980,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards that is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of approximately 2.8 years.
908259_16_ITEM15_P31_S1	The weighted average fair value of stock options issued in 2015 and 2014 was $1.05 and $1.87, respectively.
908259_16_ITEM15_P31_S2	The fair values for the stock options granted were estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:
908259_16_ITEM15_P32_S0	In calculating the estimated fair value of its stock options, the Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires the consideration of the following six variables for purposes of estimating fair value:
908259_16_ITEM15_P33_S0	the risk-free interest rate for the expected option term.
908259_16_ITEM15_P34_S0	The closing market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
908259_16_ITEM15_P35_S0	The expected term of options represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding, and is calculated based on the average of the vesting period and the option term.
908259_16_ITEM15_P35_S1	The expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Company s stock price is expected to fluctuate during the term of the option granted.
908259_16_ITEM15_P35_S2	The Company determines the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of its common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term.
908259_16_ITEM15_P35_S3	Expected Dividends Because the Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on any of its common stock and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future, the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option.
908259_16_ITEM15_P36_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury issues with a remaining life consistent with the option s expected term on the date of grant.
908259_16_ITEM15_P36_S1	The Company estimates the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and records compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
908259_16_ITEM15_P36_S2	The Company recorded expenses of $0 and $20,000 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to restricted stock awards granted from the Company s 2005 Stock Plan.
908259_16_ITEM15_P36_S3	The restricted stock awards were valued based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the grant date and the shares were fully vested upon grant.
908259_16_ITEM15_P36_S4	As of December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any unvested restricted common stock outstanding.
908259_16_ITEM15_P37_S0	Basic and diluted net loss per share was calculated by dividing the net loss per share attributed to the Company s common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
908259_16_ITEM15_P37_S1	Diluted net loss per share includes the effect of all dilutive, potentially issuable common equivalent shares as defined using the treasury stock method.
908259_16_ITEM15_P37_S2	All of the Company s common stock equivalents are anti-dilutive due to the Company s net loss position for all periods presented.
908259_16_ITEM15_P37_S3	Accordingly, common stock equivalents of approximately 2,031,000 and 672,000 options to purchase common stock and 9,842,000 and 7,445,000 warrants to purchase common stock at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares for diluted net loss per share.
908259_16_ITEM15_P38_S0	The components of the Company s deferred tax assets are as follows (in thousands):
908259_16_ITEM15_P39_S0	After consideration of the available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company has determined that a full valuation allowance at December 31, 2015 and 2014 is necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.
908259_16_ITEM15_P39_S1	The valuation allowance increased by approximately $4,300,000 and $3,877,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
908259_16_ITEM15_P39_S2	The increase for both 2015 and 2014 was due primarily to the increase in the federal net operating loss.
908259_16_ITEM15_P40_S0	As all of the Company s deferred tax assets have been reserved for in a valuation allowance, no provision for (benefit from) income taxes has been recorded in the accompanying financial statements.
908259_16_ITEM15_P40_S1	At December 31, 2015, the Company had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $237,000,000 for U.S. income tax purposes, which will begin to expire in 2020 and state operating loss carry-forwards in California of $55,000,000 which will begin to expire in 2017.
908259_16_ITEM15_P40_S2	The Company had federal research and development tax credits of $2,830,000 which will begin to expire in 2021.
908259_16_ITEM15_P40_S3	The Company also had state research and development tax credits in California of $1,023,000 which have no expiration.
908259_16_ITEM15_P41_S0	The future utilization of the net operating loss carry-forwards and credit carry-forwards is likely to be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership changes that have occurred in the past or that may occur in the future under the provisions of Section 382 or 383 of the Internal Revenue Code.
908259_16_ITEM15_P42_S0	A reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the Company s effective tax rate is as follows:
908259_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	At December 31, 2015, the Company had $1,410,000 of unrecognized tax benefits of which $963,000 relates to research and development credits and $447,000 relates to California net operating losses.
908259_16_ITEM15_P43_S1	The change in unrecognized tax benefits from December 31, 2013 is as follows (in thousands):
908259_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	The Company does not expect its unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months.
908259_16_ITEM15_P44_S1	As of December 31, 2015, due to a valuation allowance against the Company s deferred tax assets, none of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the Company s effective tax rate.

908259_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	Business Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of vascular disrupting agents, or VDAs, for the treatment of cancer.
908259_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	VDAs selectively target the vasculature of cancer tumors and obstruct a tumor s blood supply without disrupting the blood supply to normal tissues.
908259_17_ITEM1_P0_S2	Treatment with VDAs has been shown to lead to rapid and significant death of cancer cells within tumors.
908259_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	VDAs are in a class of drugs called vascular targeted therapies, or VTTs, which also includes anti-angiogenic agents, or AAs.
908259_17_ITEM1_P1_S1	There are over 12 AAs approved in the U.S. for over 15 different oncology indications.
908259_17_ITEM1_P1_S2	According to Datamonitor, 2015 sales for AAs were estimated to exceed $10 billion.
908259_17_ITEM1_P1_S3	Genentech s bevacizumab (Avastin ) had the greatest market share, with 2015 estimated sales of approximately $6.7 billion.
908259_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	Bevacizumab and other AA drugs work by preventing angiogenesis, or the growth of new blood vessels.
908259_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	We are seeking to realize the full potential of VTTs in oncology by using the combination of VDAs and AAs to treat cancer.
908259_17_ITEM1_P2_S2	Our VDAs have been shown to rapidly cut off the blood supply to the tumor, which causes necrosis, or death, of the cancer cells in the interior of the tumor.
908259_17_ITEM1_P2_S3	Conversely, AAs inhibit angiogenesis, which is the process by which new tumor blood vessels form.
908259_17_ITEM1_P2_S4	If a VDA were given in the absence of an AA, angiogenesis would allow new blood vessels to re-vascularize the tumor, including the interior where the VDA had caused tumor cell necrosis.
908259_17_ITEM1_P2_S5	Our current VDA development plans are focused on the combination of VDAs and AAs because the mechanism of action of each drug complements that of the other disrupting tumor blood supply in two different ways instead of just one.
908259_17_ITEM1_P2_S6	We believe that our VDA s direct effect on established tumor blood vessels combined with the AA s prevention of new blood vessel formation results in a significantly greater benefit to patients than either drug alone.
908259_17_ITEM1_P2_S7	Our belief in the benefit of this combination is supported by numerous preclinical studies, as well as clinical studies which demonstrate improved progression-free survival and objective response rate, as well as trends in overall survival.
908259_17_ITEM1_P2_S8	Interestingly, our VDAs have consistently shown a stronger treatment effect in larger tumors than in smaller tumors, which is in contrast to the majority of conventional therapies currently used for the treatment of cancer.
908259_17_ITEM1_P2_S9	The greater effect of our VDAs on larger tumors occurs because these larger tumors have a greater proportion of tumor cells which depend upon the tumor vasculature for their supply of oxygen and nutrients, and a smaller proportion of tumor cells that have exposure to the tumor rim, where normal tissue blood vessels can supply oxygen and nutrients to the tumor cells.
908259_17_ITEM1_P2_S10	The proportion of the tumor s blood vessels that are inside the tumor increases as the size of the tumor increases, based on volume-to-surface area ratios, allowing our drug candidates to occlude a greater percentage of a larger tumor s overall blood supply.
908259_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	The tumor cell necrosis caused by CA4P is greatest in the interior of the tumor, because cancer cells in the interior are fully reliant on the tumor vasculature for their blood supply.
908259_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	Cancer cells on or near the edge of the tumor can receive their blood supply through the tumor vasculature as well as from surrounding, normal vasculature.
908259_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	We are currently developing two clinical stage investigational drugs, which are both VDAs CA4P and OXi4503.
908259_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our lead compound is CA4P, which is also known as combretastatin A4-phosphate, fosbretabulin tromethamine, fosbretabulin and ZYBRESTAT .
908259_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	The largest clinical trial of CA4P conducted to date was a phase 2 clinical trial in recurrent ovarian cancer sponsored by the Gynecologic Oncology Group, or GOG, which was completed in 2014 and met its primary endpoint by demonstrating an improvement in progression-free survival for the patients who received CA4P. This trial, referred to as GOG-0186I, compared treatment with CA4P plus bevacizumab to treatment with bevacizumab alone.
908259_17_ITEM1_P5_S2	Based on the positive results of this clinical trial, we initiated the FOCUS Study in 2016, a phase 2/3 clinical trial of CA4P in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, with the goal of determining whether the addition of CA4P improves upon the current standard of care.
908259_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	(PCC) to treatment with bevacizumab and PCC.
908259_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	CA4P is also being studied in combination with pazopanib (Votrient ) in an on-going phase 2 clinical trial in recurrent ovarian cancer that is sponsored by The Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in the United Kingdom.
908259_17_ITEM1_P6_S2	Our second compound, OXi4503, is being studied in combination with cytarabine in an ascending-dose phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
908259_17_ITEM1_P6_S3	In 2016, we received Fast Track designation for CA4P for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
908259_17_ITEM1_P6_S4	Companies with Fast Track designation are able to benefit from more frequent meetings and communications with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, regarding development plans to support product registration, and may also be eligible for priority review of New Drug Applications, which shortens FDA s standard review timeline.
908259_17_ITEM1_P6_S5	We have also been granted orphan drug designation for CA4P for the treatment of ovarian cancer in the United States and the European Union, and for OXi4503 for the treatment of AML in the United States and the European Union.
908259_17_ITEM1_P6_S6	To date, we have observed CA4P to be well tolerated in over 475 patients and to have clinical activity in a variety of indications in addition to ovarian cancer.
908259_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	CA4P Development Program CA4P is a reversible tubulin-binding agent that selectively targets endothelial cells, which make up the interior lining of blood vessel walls in most solid tumors.
908259_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	CA4P causes these endothelial cells to change shape and detach, which obstructs the flow of blood to the tumor and starves the tumor of vital nutrients and oxygen.
908259_17_ITEM1_P7_S2	The resultant tumor ischemia leads to rapid downstream tumor cell death.
908259_17_ITEM1_P7_S3	Although CA4P acts quickly, within minutes of infusion, and its circulating half-life is approximately 4 hours, the anti-tumor effects caused by CA4P generally last for several weeks, until tumor regrowth aided by revascularization occurs.
908259_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	CA4P is given to patients via a 10 minute intravenous infusion.
908259_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	Ovarian Cancer Our primary focus for 2017 will be the development of CA4P for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
908259_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	Approximately 22,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year.
908259_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	This form of cancer is thought to begin in the ovaries and often spreads to the rest of the pelvis and abdomen prior to detection, resulting in a relatively poor prognosis.
908259_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	More than 60% of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer are in stage III or IV, making ovarian cancer difficult to treat and often fatal, with a five-year survival rate of approximately 45% a rate which is largely unchanged since the 1990s.
908259_17_ITEM1_P10_S3	Overall, approximately 80% of patients diagnosed with ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer will relapse after first-line platinum-based and taxane-based chemotherapy.
908259_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	When treating recurrent ovarian cancer, the time between receiving the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy and disease recurrence is used to help determine the choice of therapy used in the next line of treatment.
908259_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	Patients are considered to have platinum-resistant disease if the cancer progresses within six months of completing platinum-based chemotherapy.
908259_17_ITEM1_P11_S2	Approximately 25% of those who relapse after initial treatment, or more than 4,000 women, have platinum-resistant cancer, the most difficult-to-treat form of the disease.
908259_17_ITEM1_P11_S3	Additionally, a majority of patients who are not initially platinum-resistant and who may achieve remission following first-line therapy will also develop recurrent disease.
908259_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	There are relatively few treatments that have been approved for ovarian cancer, and fewer for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
908259_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	Approved drugs for ovarian cancer include bevacizumab, carboplatin and cisplatin, gemcitabine, doxorubicin, paclitaxel and olaparib.
908259_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	Many patients eventually become resistant to platinum-based therapies, and new treatment agents are needed.
908259_17_ITEM1_P12_S3	In December 2014, the FDA approved bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy (paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or topotecan) for the treatment of women with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, based on results from the phase 3 AURELIA trial, which had a primary endpoint of PFS, or progression-free survival.
908259_17_ITEM1_P12_S4	Accordingly, PFS is the primary endpoint for our FOCUS trial.
908259_17_ITEM1_P12_S5	Bevacizumab is also approved in the EU in combination with different chemotherapy regimens for platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, and the EU approvals were also based on PFS.
908259_17_ITEM1_P12_S6	In December 2016, the FDA approved bevacizumab for the treatment of platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer also, which could expand our market opportunity for CA4P, although we are presently not studying CA4P in platinum-sensitive disease.
908259_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	CA4P has been granted Fast Track designation in the U.S. for treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
908259_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	CA4P has also been granted orphan drug designation in both the U.S. and the European Union for the treatment of ovarian cancer.
908259_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	Genentech s bevacizumab is an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, monoclonal antibody which has been approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer in the United States and elsewhere.
908259_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	The GOG-0186I clinical trial was conducted by the GOG, now part of NRG Oncology, under the sponsorship of the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and was a randomized, two-arm phase 2 clinical trial evaluating CA4P plus bevacizumab compared to bevacizumab alone in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.
908259_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	The GOG-0186I clinical trial enrolled a total of 107 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer at 67 clinical sites in the United States.
908259_17_ITEM1_P15_S2	The results indicated a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival (PFS) in the combination arm, which was the primary endpoint of the trial, with a p-value of 0.049 (pre-specified analysis using a one-sided test; 10% level of significance).
908259_17_ITEM1_P15_S3	The hazard ratio was 0.685, with a 90% 2-sided confidence interval (CI) of 0.47 ~1.00.
908259_17_ITEM1_P15_S4	Median PFS was 7.3 months for CA4P plus bevacizumab (n=54), compared to 4.8 months for bevacizumab alone (n= 53).
908259_17_ITEM1_P15_S5	Patients in both arms were treated until disease progression or adverse effects prohibited further therapy.
908259_17_ITEM1_P15_S6	In a post-hoc subgroup analysis, data showed that patients who were platinum-resistant had an even greater improvement in PFS with the combination.
908259_17_ITEM1_P15_S7	Among the 27 patients who were platinum-resistant, median PFS was 6.7 months for those receiving CA4P plus bevacizumab compared to 3.4 months for those receiving bevacizumab alone, and the results were statistically significant with a p-value of 0.01 and a hazard ratio of 0.57.
908259_17_ITEM1_P15_S8	These findings suggest that adding CA4P to bevacizumab has a greater effect in the difficult-to-treat platinum-resistant patient group than it does for platinum-sensitive patients.
908259_17_ITEM1_P15_S9	Although the results were stronger for the platinum-resistant patients, the 80 patients who were platinum-sensitive still showed a numerical improvement in PFS for the combination therapy, with a median PFS of 7.6 months for those receiving CA4P plus bevacizumab compared to 6.1 months for those receiving bevacizumab alone, although the results were not statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.139 and a hazard ratio of 0.67.
908259_17_ITEM1_P15_S10	Based on the final dataset as of November 2015, the median overall survival (OS) for the GOG-0186I Study in the intent-to-treat (ITT) group was 3.2 months longer for the CA4P-treated patients compared to the control patients (25.2 vs. 22.0 months, respectively; HR=0.83, p=NS).
908259_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	The GOG-0186I Study included 81 patients (75.7% of study patients) with recurrent ovarian cancer that was deemed measurable , as defined by RECIST criteria, and 26 patients (24.3%) deemed non-measurable.
908259_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	Measurable disease is generally defined as primary tumor sizes greater than 1 cm in diameter, while non-measurable tumors are generally identified and monitored by increased serum CA-125 antigen levels, ascites, or other clinical signs of disease.
908259_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	Patients with measurable disease who received the combination of CA4P and bevacizumab achieved a higher objective response rate, or ORR, a secondary endpoint in the clinical trial, measured according to RECIST criteria.
908259_17_ITEM1_P16_S3	Although not a statistically significant result, patients receiving the combination had an ORR of 35.7% (n=42; 90% CI 23.5 ~ 49.5%) compared to 28.2% for patients on bevacizumab alone (n=39; 90% CI 16.7 ~ 42.3%).
908259_17_ITEM1_P16_S4	In the subgroup of platinum-resistant patients, the addition of CA4P to bevacizumab increased ORR to 40.0% (n=10) compared to 12.5% (n=8) for bevacizumab alone.
908259_17_ITEM1_P16_S5	More importantly, patients with measurable disease treated with CA4P had a 5.6 month improvement in median OS (26.8 vs. 21.2 months; 22% reduction in the risk of death; HR=0.78, not statistically significant), and a 3.7 month improvement in progression free survival (PFS) (9.8 vs. 6.1 months; HR=0.60, p=0.027) compared to control patients with measurable disease.
908259_17_ITEM1_P16_S6	Additional analyses were conducted on patients with measurable disease whose tumors were larger than the median baseline tumor size (tumor size 5.7 cm; n=41), showing CA4P-treated patients with these larger tumors experienced a 48% reduction in the risk of death (HR=0.52; p=0.095) and a 6.2 month improvement in median PFS (10.5 vs. 4.3 months; HR=0.55, p=0.071) compared to control patients.
908259_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	All adverse events in the clinical trial were manageable, with one Grade 4 event occurring in each treatment arm.
908259_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	Consistent with prior clinical experience with CA4P, patients in the combination arm experienced an increased incidence of Grade 3 hypertension compared to the control arm (17 events for the combination compared to 10 events for bevacizumab alone).
908259_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	One patient on the combination regimen had a Grade 3 thromboembolic event.
908259_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	All cases of hypertension were managed with anti-hypertensive treatments, as specified in the clinical trial protocol.
908259_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	CA4P in Combination with Bevacizumab and Physician s Choice Chemotherapy Phase 2/3 FOCUS Study Based on the positive overall results from the GOG-0186I clinical trial in recurrent ovarian cancer, including the stronger results among the subgroup of platinum-resistant patients and among the patients with measurable disease, we initiated the FOCUS Clinical Study in June 2016.
908259_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	FOCUS is a phase 2/3 clinical trial of CA4P seeking to demonstrate whether CA4P improves upon the current standard of care for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer the current standard of care being treatment with both bevacizumab and chemotherapy.
908259_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	The primary endpoint of FOCUS is PFS, and secondary endpoints include ORR, OS and safety.
908259_17_ITEM1_P19_S3	If results from the second stage of the clinical study meet the primary endpoint, we plan to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA.
908259_17_ITEM1_P19_S4	The FDA has approved the protocol for FOCUS.
908259_17_ITEM1_P19_S5	In FOCUS, we are enrolling platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients with measurable disease, and randomizing them on a 1:1 basis into either the treatment group or the control group.
908259_17_ITEM1_P19_S6	The treatment group receives CA4P, bevacizumab and PCC, while the control group receives only bevacizumab and PCC.
908259_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	The clinical trial is designed in two sequential stages in the first stage we are enrolling up to 80 patients and conducting interim analyses after 20, 40, 60 and 80 patients have been treated for approximately three months.
908259_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	The goal of the first stage is to verify efficacy seen in the GOG-0186I Study, confirm the safety of the treatment regimen in this population, and to confirm powering assumptions for the second stage.
908259_17_ITEM1_P20_S2	In the second stage, which is designed to support registration of CA4P in the United States and elsewhere, we plan to enroll up to 356 additional patients.
908259_17_ITEM1_P20_S3	The FOCUS Study is currently enrolling patients in the United States and western Europe, with the first interim analysis expected in April 2017.
908259_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	CA4P in Combination with Pazopanib Ongoing Phase 2 Clinical Trial Pazopanib is an anti-angiogenic oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and soft tissue sarcoma (STS).
908259_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	Pazopanib is also approved for ovarian and other cancers in the European Union, and was initially developed by GlaxoSmithKline, then sold to Novartis in 2015.
908259_17_ITEM1_P21_S2	We believe that using CA4P in combination with pazopanib may provide a clinically active yet potentially better tolerated alternative to the current standard of care, cytotoxic chemotherapy, for relapsed ovarian cancer.
908259_17_ITEM1_P21_S3	The PAZOFOS trial in advanced recurrent ovarian cancer patients consists of a 12 patient phase 1b dose escalation portion with the combination of pazopanib and CA4P, which has been completed, followed by a 120 patient randomized phase 2 portion comparing pazopanib plus CA4P to pazopanib alone in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer.
908259_17_ITEM1_P21_S4	We are incurring limited costs for this trial, which is sponsored by The Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and coordinated by the Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Trials Coordination Unit, or MAHSC-CTU, with additional support from The University of Manchester, the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and Mount Vernon Cancer Centre (part of the East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust).
908259_17_ITEM1_P21_S5	In October 2014, the first patient was enrolled in the phase 1b portion of the trial, with the goal of finding an appropriate combination dose of CA4P and pazopanib for the phase 2 portion of the trial.
908259_17_ITEM1_P21_S6	Following the investigators identification of an appropriate dose combination, in July 2016 the first patient was enrolled in the phase 2 portion of the trial.
908259_17_ITEM1_P21_S7	The primary endpoint of the trial is PFS, and secondary endpoints include ORR, OS and safety.
908259_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	Approximately 14,000 patients in the U.S. are diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumors, or NETs, each year.
908259_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	Since patients with NETs can have prolonged survival rates of over 5 years, it is estimated that the overall prevalence is much higher, approximating 100,000 patients in the U.S.
908259_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	substances including hormones, many of which are biologically active and can result in debilitating symptoms including flushing, diarrhea, weight loss and, less frequently, bronchoconstriction and heart failure.
908259_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	It is our belief, based on the available preclinical data, that by reducing blood flow to these tumors using CA4P, we may be able to reduce the production of tumor-derived substances, including the biologically active hormones.
908259_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	We have completed a phase 2 monotherapy clinical trial of CA4P in 18 patients with gastrointestinal or pancreatic NETs and elevated biomarkers.
908259_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	One patient (6%) experienced significant symptomatic improvement as measured by ECOG Status and had a partial response per investigator-assessed RECIST criteria, and an additional 7 patients (39%) had stable disease.
908259_17_ITEM1_P24_S2	In addition, a majority of patients (53%) experienced an improvement in patient-reported quality of life.
908259_17_ITEM1_P24_S3	A statistically significant mean change in biomarkers from baseline, the primary endpoint of the study, was not achieved due to the small sample size along with a high intra-and inter-patient variability observed in the biomarkers.
908259_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	A total of 7 patients were enrolled in a follow-up trial, of which 5 patients (71%) had stable disease, including one that continued for 14 months.
908259_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	The partial response and stable disease analyses, as well as other measures from the trial, suggest that CA4P monotherapy has activity in this indication.
908259_17_ITEM1_P25_S2	Based on the evidence of efficacy observed in this trial, plus an understanding of the benefits of VTT combination therapy, a lead investigator in this trial is sponsoring and funding a 20 patient study in NETs using CA4P in combination with everolimus (AFINITOR , marketed by Novartis), an anti-angiogenic agent which is already approved and commonly used in this indication.
908259_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	CA4P has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors in both the U.S. and the European Union.
908259_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	Glioblastoma Multiforme We are exploring recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM, as an additional indication for CA4P because:
908259_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	rapid enrollment would be expected in clinical trials for this indication.
908259_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	CA4P has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of glioma in the United States.
908259_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	If funds become available for us to initiate and complete a clinical trial in GBM, we expect that we would pursue a trial.
908259_17_ITEM1_P28_S2	However, we currently do not plan to initiate a GBM clinical trial in the near term in order to conserve current resources.
908259_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer, or ATC We have previously conducted a randomized, controlled clinical trial in ATC.
908259_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	ATC is one of the most aggressive tumors known and has very few treatment options.
908259_17_ITEM1_P29_S2	Results of the FACT Study, which combined CA4P with chemotherapy and which, in 2010, we terminated early (after 80 patients were enrolled) due to slow enrollment, showed a numerical improvement in OS for the CA4P group (5.2 months) compared to the control group (4.0 months), although the results were not statistically significant.
908259_17_ITEM1_P29_S3	Results also showed an improvement in ORR for the CA4P group (20.0%) compared to the control group (16.0%), although these results were not statistically significant.
908259_17_ITEM1_P29_S4	We believe the numerical improvements shown for the CA4P group compared to the control group provide supportive evidence for the potential benefit of CA4P against this tumor type, and for the overall potential of CA4P against other highly vascular solid tumors.
908259_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma, or NSCLC We have previously conducted a randomized, controlled clinical trial in NSCLC.
908259_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	NSCLC accounts for most cases of lung cancer, and generally does not respond well to chemotherapy.
908259_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	completed in 2011, which enrolled 63 patients and combined CA4P with both bevacizumab and chemotherapy, showed a numerical improvement in ORR for the CA4P group (56.3%) compared to the control group (35.5%), although the results were not statistically significant.
908259_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	The FALCON Study only enrolled patients who had not previously received chemotherapy.
908259_17_ITEM1_P32_S2	We believe the patients initial exposure to chemotherapy, requiring six cycles in the study, contributed to a high dropout rate among both treatment groups (46.8% and 38.7% for CA4P and control, respectively), making evaluation of PFS, the primary endpoint, difficult.
908259_17_ITEM1_P32_S3	However, we believe the numerical improvements in response rates shown for the CA4P group compared to the control group provide supportive evidence for the potential benefit of CA4P against this tumor type, and for the overall potential of CA4P against other highly vascular solid tumors.
908259_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	Combination with Immune Oncology Agents Preclinical Research Over the last several years, there have been considerable advances in cancer immunotherapy, which makes use of the immune system to treat cancer.
908259_17_ITEM1_P33_S1	However, these immune oncology agents have significant limitations when used as single agents to treat cancer, since relatively few patients achieve a durable clinical response following treatment.
908259_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	Because CA4P causes tumor cell necrosis within hours of its administration, we believe it may in turn release into the circulation tumor antigens that enhance the immune system, and consequently enhance the presence and activity of T-cells within tumors.
908259_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	We believe CA4P s potential enhanced immunologic effect may result in more and/or better clinical responses in certain cancers when combined with immune oncology agents, including in patients who have not experienced a response to therapy with immune oncology agents alone.
908259_17_ITEM1_P34_S2	We have completed several preclinical studies evaluating CA4P in combination with immune oncology agents.
908259_17_ITEM1_P34_S3	Of these studies, the best results were found combining CA4P with an anti-CTLA4 antibody in an EMT-6 mammary tumor model.
908259_17_ITEM1_P34_S4	In this study, 7 of 8 mice receiving a combination of CA4P and an anti-CTLA4 antibody experienced complete remission of their tumors, compared to 1 of 8 in the CA4P monotherapy arm and 2 of 8 in the anti-CTLA4 antibody monotherapy arm.
908259_17_ITEM1_P34_S5	Three of four follow-up studies have also indicated that CA4P combined with immune oncology agents can delay tumor growth these studies were conducted in a larger tumor EMT-6 mammary model, a C3H mammary model and a CT26 colon model, providing additional supportive evidence that CA4P may enhance anti-CTLA4 antibody activity, as well as initial evidence that CA4P may enhance anti PD-1 and PD-L1 activity.
908259_17_ITEM1_P34_S6	Based on these initial results, we are now planning additional preclinical work in this area.
908259_17_ITEM1_P34_S7	In addition to pursuing development of CA4P, we are also pursuing the development of a second product candidate, OXi4503, a novel, dual-mechanism VDA, which not only has been shown to reduce tumor blood flow but which also forms a potentially anti-proliferative metabolite.
908259_17_ITEM1_P34_S8	We believe that this dual mechanism of OXi4503 may result in enhanced anti-tumor activity in certain tumor types.
908259_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	Based on preclinical data, we believe that OXi4503 may be particularly active in certain cancers, including AML, which have relatively high levels of the enzymes that facilitate the conversion of OXi4503 into a metabolite that directly kills tumor cells.
908259_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	OXi4503 has shown potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies of solid tumors and AML, and in two clinical studies in advanced solid tumors and liver tumors, both as a single agent and in combination with other anti-proliferative agents.
908259_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	Acute Myeloid Leukemia AML is a cancer of the myeloid blood cells, with approximately 10,500 new cases each year in the U.S. AML is characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that pollute bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells.
908259_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	OXi4503 has been granted orphan drug designation in both the U.S. and the European Union for the treatment of AML.
908259_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	With support from The Leukemia Lymphoma Society s Therapy Acceleration Program, the University of Florida sponsored a phase 1 clinical trial of patients with AML or MDS, a related disorder of the normal blood formation process.
908259_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	designed to assess the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose and biologic activity of OXi4503.
908259_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	In October 2015 we closed the investigator-sponsored study and initiated a Mateon-sponsored study, OX1222, prior to the determination of a maximum tolerated dose, in order to bring the clinical trial under our direct management and expand the number of sites enrolling patients.
908259_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	Initial data from UF4503 was presented at the December 2013 annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology, or ASH.
908259_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	Among the first 13 patients treated at the two lowest dose levels, two patients showed stable disease, one patient had a partial remission and one patient achieved a complete bone marrow response.
908259_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	Side effects included increases in D-dimer (a substance in the blood that is released when a blood clot breaks up), bone pain, fever, chills and flu-like symptoms.
908259_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	Accordingly, OXi4503 appeared to be reasonably well-tolerated based on these results in patients with relapsed and refractory AML and MDS.
908259_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	In December 2015 we initiated the second stage of OX1222, in which ascending doses of OXi4503 are being used in combination with cytarabine, an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of AML.
908259_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	Data from the first two cohorts of the Mateon-sponsored trial was presented at the December 2016 annual meeting of ASH.
908259_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	The second cohort enrolled 4 patients, each receiving a dose of 4.68 mg/m 2 of OXi4503 in combination with the same intermediate dose of cytarabine.
908259_17_ITEM1_P42_S2	Patients enrolled into the trial were treatment-resistant, end-stage AML/MDS patients who had on average four prior therapy failures before entering the study.
908259_17_ITEM1_P42_S3	In total 2 of 10 (20%) patients achieved a complete remission (CR) on treatment one patient of six (17%) responded in the 3.75 mg/m 2 dose cohort, and one patient of four (25%) responded in the 4.68 mg/m 2 dose cohort.
908259_17_ITEM1_P42_S4	One of these two patients remains in CR at 9 months following treatment with OXi4503 and the other remained in CR for approximately 6 months before the disease recurred.
908259_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	OXi4503 was generally well tolerated in the first two cohorts of the study.
908259_17_ITEM1_P43_S1	The adverse event profile remains similar to that seen in the monotherapy portion of the trial, with coagulopathies and hematological adverse events the most significant events.
908259_17_ITEM1_P43_S2	The most common drug-related SAEs were anemia (30%), neutropenia (30%), D-dimer increase (20%), thrombocytopenia (20%), and AST increase (20%).
908259_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	One patient in the 3.75 mg/m 2 cohort experienced a dose-limiting toxicity of hypofibrinogenemia, or low levels of fibrinogen in the blood, with no clinical evidence of bleeding, which resolved with treatment.
908259_17_ITEM1_P44_S1	In March 2017 we announced preliminary data from the third cohort, which enrolled 4 patients at a dose of 6.25 mg/m 2 of OXi4503 in combination with the same intermediate dose of cytarabine.
908259_17_ITEM1_P44_S2	In the third cohort, one patient (25%) had a CR and one additional patient in the study remained in treatment.
908259_17_ITEM1_P44_S3	The CR in this cohort is particularly encouraging because the patient has a high risk TP53 gene mutation.
908259_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	Similar to the first two cohorts, OXi4503 was generally well tolerated and adverse events were also similar to the first two cohorts, with no significant adverse events.
908259_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	There were no dose-limiting toxicities observed in the third cohort, and following a safety review committee recommendation we initiated enrollment in the fourth cohort, at an OXi4503 dose of 7.81 mg/m 2 .
908259_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	According to Cancer Research UK, a non-profit cancer research organization in the United Kingdom, nearly 90% of all cancers are solid tumors that are dependent upon a continually evolving vascular supply for their growth and survival.
908259_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	VTTs, which include AAs and VDAs, are designed to interfere with a tumor s vascular supply.
908259_17_ITEM1_P47_S2	AAs are drugs that interfere with tumor blood vessel growth, as described further in the table below, and since 2004, a number have been approved for a variety of cancer indications.
908259_17_ITEM1_P47_S3	Development of AAs for new indications continues, and physician adoption of AAs has been rapid.
908259_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	VDAs are drugs that disrupt existing tumor blood vessels.
908259_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	Although a number of VDAs have been in clinical development, to date none have been approved.
908259_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	We believe that the historical focus on development of VDAs as a single agent, rather than as an agent for use in combination with an AA, is the primary reason that VDA development to date has generally not been successful.
908259_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	While VDAs such as CA4P deprive tumors of blood supply, as do AAs, the mechanism of action of VDAs is quite different than that of AAs.
908259_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	VDAs such as CA4P have a direct effect on existing tumor blood vessels, and act by rapidly obstructing the blood supply to cancer tumors.
908259_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	formation of new blood vessels to cancer tumors.
908259_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	We believe that our VDA drug candidates and approved AAs are complementary to each other in that one agent destroys existing tumor vasculature and the other prevents new tumor vasculature from forming.
908259_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	We intend for substantially all of our future CA4P development to be focused on this combination, rather than pursuing CA4P approval as a monotherapy.
908259_17_ITEM1_P50_S3	We believe our VDAs are a second generation of VTTs that have the potential to improve upon the efficacy of AAs, the first generation of VTTs.
908259_17_ITEM1_P50_S4	Our belief in the synergy of CA4P and AAs is supported by the data we have gathered showing an improvement in certain patient outcomes when both agents are used in combination.
908259_17_ITEM1_P50_S5	Several preclinical studies, as well as the results of the phase 2 GOG-0186I clinical trial, have confirmed the potential of this approach.
908259_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	As illustrated in the table below, VDA and anti-angiogenic drugs act via different mechanisms to produce complementary biological and anti-vascular effects with mostly non-overlapping side effects.
908259_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	In preclinical studies, VDA plus anti-angiogenic drug combinations demonstrate robust and additive anti-tumor effects.
908259_17_ITEM1_P51_S2	Results from human clinical trials with combinations of CA4P and bevacizumab provide support and initial clinical validation for combining these agents to significantly increase clinical activity without significantly increasing side-effects.
908259_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	Chronic hypertension with long-term use; Acute-impairment in wound healing; Hemorrhage, hemoptysis, gastrointestinal perforation, proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, thromboembolic events, etc.
908259_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	Transient acute blood pressure increases; Tumor pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue; Effects on hematopoiesis and white blood cell counts; In AML similar to solid tumors with more pronounced effects on coagulation and hematopoiesis We believe our VDA drug candidates act on tumor blood vessels via two complementary mechanisms, tubulin depolymerization and disengagement of the junctional protein VE-cadherin, which cause a change in the shape of tumor vascular endothelial cells, tumor vessel occlusion, and the subsequent blockage of blood-flow to the tumor, which deprives the tumor of oxygen and nutrients essential for survival.
908259_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	In vitro studies have demonstrated that our VDA drug candidates act in a reversible fashion on tubulin inside newly-formed and growing endothelial cells, such as the vascular endothelial cells comprising tumor vasculature.
908259_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	By binding to the tubulin, CA4P is able to alter the structural framework that normally maintains the cells flat shape.
908259_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	When this occurs, the shape of the cells changes from flat to round, resulting in physical blockage of the blood vessels.
908259_17_ITEM1_P54_S2	The resulting shutdown in blood-flow then deprives tumor cells of the oxygen and nutrients necessary for maintenance and growth and also prevents tumor cells from being able to excrete toxic metabolic waste products.
908259_17_ITEM1_P54_S3	The consequence of the blockage is extensive tumor cell death.
908259_17_ITEM1_P54_S4	Preclinical research, published in the November 2005 issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation, showed that CA4P also disrupts the molecular engagement of VE-cadherin, a junctional protein important for endothelial cell survival and function.
908259_17_ITEM1_P54_S5	The authors of the research article conclude that this effect only occurs in endothelial cells which lack contact with smooth muscle cells, a known feature of abnormal vasculature associated with tumors and other disease processes.
908259_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	The disengagement of VE-cadherin leads to endothelial cell detachment, which in turn, can cause permanent physical blockage of vessels.
908259_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	Preclinical and clinical study results indicate that CA4P exerts anti-vascular effects rapidly, within hours of administration, and the half-life of the active form of CA4P in humans is approximately four hours.
908259_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	In part because the half-life of the active form of CA4P is relatively short, the effects of CA4P on tubulin are reversible, and the pharmacodynamic effect lasts for weeks, CA4P is typically administered no more frequently than once per week.
908259_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	The side-effects of CA4P are typically transient in nature, limited to the period of time following administration when the active form of CA4P is in the body in significant concentrations.
908259_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	This contrasts with AAs, which are typically administered on a chronic basis so as to constantly maintain levels of drug in the body.
908259_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	months, and as a result can cause a variety of chronic side-effects that are not limited to the immediate period following administration.
908259_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	Side-effects associated with CA4P are generally transient and manageable.
908259_17_ITEM1_P59_S1	The most frequent CA4P side-effects include acute blood pressure increases, infusion-related side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache and fatigue, and tumor pain, which is consistent with the drug s mechanism-of-action.
908259_17_ITEM1_P59_S2	Incrementally, we have noted that approximately 15-30% more patients treated with CA4P experience clinically-significant acute blood pressure increases compared to control patients.
908259_17_ITEM1_P59_S3	The acute blood pressure increases are often manageable by controlling underlying hypertension or treating with short-acting anti-hypertensives prior to CA4P infusion.
908259_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	The incidence of serious cardiovascular side-effects such as angina and myocardial ischemia observed across all studies to date (including early studies in which hypertension management and prevention was not employed) was less than 3%, a frequency comparable to that reported with approved anti-angiogenic agents such as bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib.
908259_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	Our primary focus is on advancing the clinical development of our drug candidates CA4P and OXi4503.
908259_17_ITEM1_P61_S1	We are also seeking to find additional potential uses for our clinical candidates and to identify new preclinical candidates that are complementary to our VDAs.
908259_17_ITEM1_P61_S2	In order to help achieve these objectives, we have established relationships with universities, research organizations and other institutions in the fields of our interest.
908259_17_ITEM1_P61_S3	We plan to continue to rely on these external relationships as our programs advance, although the composition of our external relationships may change.
908259_17_ITEM1_P61_S4	Currently, we have collaborative agreements and arrangements with a number of institutions which we utilize to perform certain activities associated with drug discovery and drug development.
908259_17_ITEM1_P61_S5	In 2016, collaborations and agreements were ongoing with several universities and research institutions, including the following:
908259_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	For rights to CA4P, we have secured a technology license from Arizona State University, or ASU.
908259_17_ITEM1_P62_S1	The ASU license is an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license for commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including among others, CA4P and OXi4503.
908259_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	Combretastatins were originally isolated from the bark of the South African Bush Willow tree by researchers from Arizona State University but are now created by synthetic means and have tubulin-dependent anti-vascular and anti-proliferative properties.
908259_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	Under the ASU license, we have the right to grant sublicenses.
908259_17_ITEM1_P64_S1	ASU is entitled to single-digit royalty payments under the license agreement during the term of the patents licensed from ASU.
908259_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	We bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the ASU license.
908259_17_ITEM1_P65_S1	Under the license agreement, we have agreed to diligently proceed with the development, manufacture and sale of products using the licensed technology.
908259_17_ITEM1_P66_S0	ASU has the first responsibility of enforcing patents under the license agreement.
908259_17_ITEM1_P66_S1	License payments made to ASU to date have amounted to $2,700,000, with no further license payments due on the combretastatins we are developing.
908259_17_ITEM1_P66_S2	The agreement remains in force until the expiration of the last to expire patent subject to the ASU license.
908259_17_ITEM1_P66_S3	Either party may terminate the ASU license agreement upon material default or bankruptcy of the other party.
908259_17_ITEM1_P66_S4	In addition, we may terminate the agreement if we determine that filing for regulatory approval is not warranted or economically feasible or upon two months written notice.
908259_17_ITEM1_P67_S0	combretastatins, including among others, CA4P. Under the BMS license, we have the right to grant sublicenses, and BMS is entitled to low single-digit royalty payments for all commercial sales plus any remuneration we receive for sale of CA4P under named patient or compassionate use programs.
908259_17_ITEM1_P67_S1	All licensing fees and milestone payments under the BMS license, in the aggregate amount of $1,080,000, have been paid.
908259_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	We bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the BMS license and have a right, but not a duty, of enforcing patents covered by the license.
908259_17_ITEM1_P68_S1	Either party may terminate the BMS license upon material default of the other party.
908259_17_ITEM1_P68_S2	The term of the BMS license ends upon the expiration of the licensed patents.
908259_17_ITEM1_P68_S3	The latest United States patent licensed under the BMS license is scheduled to expire in December 2021, excluding a patent term extension available under the Hatch-Waxman Act.
908259_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	Under a sponsored research agreement with Baylor University, we are pursuing discovery and development of additional novel, small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, including small-molecule cathepsin-K inhibitors, cathepsin-L inhibitors and hypoxia-activated VDAs.
908259_17_ITEM1_P70_S0	Cathepsin-L is an enzyme involved in protein degradation and has been shown to be closely involved in the processes of angiogenesis and metastasis.
908259_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	Small molecule inhibitors may have the potential to slow tumor growth and metastasis in a manner we believe could be complementary with our VDA therapeutics.
908259_17_ITEM1_P71_S1	We believe that our hypoxia-activated VDAs could serve as line-extension products to CA4P and/or OXi4503.
908259_17_ITEM1_P71_S2	We also have an exclusive license from Baylor University to novel compositions developed for the treatment of vascular disorders, inflammation, parasitic diseases and infections, fungal diseases and infections and/or cancer.
908259_17_ITEM1_P71_S3	We have the right to grant sublicenses under the Baylor license.
908259_17_ITEM1_P71_S4	The agreement with Baylor provides for low-single-digit royalties to be paid by us for sales generated through use of Baylor s compounds.
908259_17_ITEM1_P71_S5	Further, commencing in the first year that we provide no research funding to Baylor University we must pay a minimum annual royalty payment of $40,000.
908259_17_ITEM1_P71_S6	We are not required to pay Baylor for use of Baylor s compounds other than pursuant to this royalty arrangement.
908259_17_ITEM1_P71_S7	We are entitled to file, prosecute and maintain patent applications on products for which we have a license under this agreement.
908259_17_ITEM1_P71_S8	We have made a one-time payment of $50,000 for the licensing fee that was used as a credit against research expenses generated by Baylor.
908259_17_ITEM1_P71_S9	Either party may terminate the license agreement upon material default of the other party.
908259_17_ITEM1_P71_S10	The term of the license shall end upon the expiration of the licensed patents.
908259_17_ITEM1_P71_S11	The latest U.S. patent licensed under this agreement is scheduled to expire in November 2030.
908259_17_ITEM1_P71_S12	We previously licensed certain patents related to vascular disrupting agents for treating neuroendocrine tumors and associated symptoms and syndromes from Angiogene Pharmaceuticals Ltd. prior to our termination of the agreement in 2016.
908259_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	We were originally incorporated in 1988 in New York as OXiGENE, Inc., reincorporating in Delaware in 1992.
908259_17_ITEM1_P72_S1	In 2016, we changed our name to Mateon Therapeutics, Inc.
908259_17_ITEM1_P73_S0	Our principal corporate office is in the United States at 701 Gateway Boulevard, Suite 210, South San Francisco, California 94080 (telephone: (650) 635-7000, fax: (650) 635-7001).
908259_17_ITEM1_P73_S1	Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, are available to you free of charge through the Investors News section of our web site as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
908259_17_ITEM1_P73_S2	Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our web site is not and shall not be deemed to be a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. REGULATORY MATTERS Government Regulation and Product Approval Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing.
908259_17_ITEM1_P73_S3	Our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application, or NDA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States.
908259_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations.
908259_17_ITEM1_P74_S1	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
908259_17_ITEM1_P74_S2	Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions.
908259_17_ITEM1_P74_S3	These sanctions could include the FDA s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusal of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties.
908259_17_ITEM1_P74_S4	Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
908259_17_ITEM1_P75_S0	The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
908259_17_ITEM1_P76_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA.
908259_17_ITEM1_P76_S1	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
908259_17_ITEM1_P77_S0	Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage.
908259_17_ITEM1_P77_S1	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies.
908259_17_ITEM1_P77_S2	An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND.
908259_17_ITEM1_P77_S3	The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation.
908259_17_ITEM1_P78_S0	Preclinical testing continues even after the IND is submitted.
908259_17_ITEM1_P78_S1	The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold.
908259_17_ITEM1_P78_S2	In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.
908259_17_ITEM1_P78_S3	Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
908259_17_ITEM1_P78_S4	All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations.
908259_17_ITEM1_P78_S5	These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
908259_17_ITEM1_P78_S6	Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution.
908259_17_ITEM1_P78_S7	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
908259_17_ITEM1_P78_S8	The IRB also approves the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
908259_17_ITEM1_P78_S9	Each new clinical protocol must be submitted to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval.
908259_17_ITEM1_P78_S10	Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and efficacy in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.
908259_17_ITEM1_P79_S0	Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
908259_17_ITEM1_P80_S0	Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
908259_17_ITEM1_P80_S1	In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
908259_17_ITEM1_P81_S0	Phase 2: Involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate preliminary efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
908259_17_ITEM1_P82_S0	Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
908259_17_ITEM1_P82_S1	These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling.
908259_17_ITEM1_P83_S0	During the development of a new drug, sponsors may, under certain circumstances request a special protocol assessment, or SPA, from the FDA.
908259_17_ITEM1_P83_S1	For example, a sponsor may request an SPA of a protocol for a clinical trial that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in an NDA.
908259_17_ITEM1_P83_S2	The request, which must be made prior to commencing the trial, must include the proposed protocol and protocol-specific questions that the sponsor would like the FDA to answer regarding the protocol design, clinical trial goals and data analysis for the proposed investigation.
908259_17_ITEM1_P83_S3	After receiving the request, the FDA will consider whether the submission is appropriate for an SPA.
908259_17_ITEM1_P83_S4	If an SPA is appropriate, the FDA will base its assessment on the questions posed by the sponsor.
908259_17_ITEM1_P83_S5	Comments from the FDA review team are supposed to be sent to the sponsor within 45 calendar days of receipt of the request.
908259_17_ITEM1_P83_S6	The sponsor may request a meeting to discuss the comments and any remaining issues and uncertainties regarding the protocol.
908259_17_ITEM1_P83_S7	If the sponsor and the FDA reach agreement regarding the protocol, the agreement will be documented and made part of the administrative record.
908259_17_ITEM1_P83_S8	This agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins, except (1) with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or (2) if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began.
908259_17_ITEM1_P84_S0	Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA.
908259_17_ITEM1_P84_S1	IND Safety Reports must be submitted to the FDA, IRBs and the investigators for (a) any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected; (b) any findings from epidemiological studies, pooled analysis of multiple trials, or clinical trials(other than those already reported in (a)); (c) any findings from animal or in vitro testing, whether or not conducted by the sponsor, that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug, such as reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure; and (d) any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
908259_17_ITEM1_P84_S2	Phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
908259_17_ITEM1_P84_S3	The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
908259_17_ITEM1_P84_S4	Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
908259_17_ITEM1_P85_S0	Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
908259_17_ITEM1_P85_S1	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug.
908259_17_ITEM1_P85_S2	Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
908259_17_ITEM1_P86_S0	relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product.
908259_17_ITEM1_P86_S1	The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances, which may include orphan drug status and the first NDA application for a company.
908259_17_ITEM1_P86_S2	In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective.
908259_17_ITEM1_P86_S3	The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
908259_17_ITEM1_P86_S4	Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
908259_17_ITEM1_P87_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing.
908259_17_ITEM1_P87_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing.
908259_17_ITEM1_P87_S2	In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information.
908259_17_ITEM1_P87_S3	The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
908259_17_ITEM1_P88_S0	Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
908259_17_ITEM1_P88_S1	The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
908259_17_ITEM1_P88_S2	The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
908259_17_ITEM1_P88_S3	The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information.
908259_17_ITEM1_P88_S4	Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
908259_17_ITEM1_P88_S5	Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
908259_17_ITEM1_P88_S6	The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA.
908259_17_ITEM1_P89_S0	The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product s identity, strength, quality and purity.
908259_17_ITEM1_P90_S0	Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.
908259_17_ITEM1_P90_S1	The FDA will also inspect selected clinical sites that participated in the clinical studies and may inspect the testing facilities that performed the GLP toxicology studies cited in the NDA.
908259_17_ITEM1_P91_S0	NDAs receive either standard or priority review.
908259_17_ITEM1_P91_S1	A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review.
908259_17_ITEM1_P91_S2	In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
908259_17_ITEM1_P91_S3	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials.
908259_17_ITEM1_P91_S4	Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process.
908259_17_ITEM1_P92_S0	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
908259_17_ITEM1_P92_S1	In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized.
908259_17_ITEM1_P93_S0	Orphan Drug Designation Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug.
908259_17_ITEM1_P93_S1	Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA.
908259_17_ITEM1_P94_S0	therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
908259_17_ITEM1_P94_S1	Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
908259_17_ITEM1_P94_S2	If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years.
908259_17_ITEM1_P94_S3	Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor s product for the same indication or disease.
908259_17_ITEM1_P95_S0	In the European Union and Japan, orphan drug exclusivity regulations provide for 10 years of marketing exclusivity for orphan drugs that are approved for the treatment of rare diseases or conditions.
908259_17_ITEM1_P95_S1	CA4P has been awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of anaplastic, medullary, Stage IV papillary and Stage IV follicular thyroid cancers, ovarian cancer, neuroendocrine tumors and glioma.
908259_17_ITEM1_P95_S2	OXi4503 has been awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia.
908259_17_ITEM1_P95_S3	CA4P has also been awarded orphan drug status by the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer, ovarian cancer and neuroendocrine tumors.
908259_17_ITEM1_P95_S4	OXi4503 has been awarded orphan drug status by the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia.
908259_17_ITEM1_P96_S0	Expedited Review and Approval The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints.
908259_17_ITEM1_P96_S1	Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may subsequently decide the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the FDA may not shorten the review or approval time period.
908259_17_ITEM1_P96_S2	Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments.
908259_17_ITEM1_P97_S0	Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied.
908259_17_ITEM1_P97_S1	Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review.
908259_17_ITEM1_P98_S0	Drugs that receive an accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect of a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
908259_17_ITEM1_P98_S1	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials.
908259_17_ITEM1_P99_S0	CA4P has been awarded Fast Track designation for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
908259_17_ITEM1_P100_S0	In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and if any of our product candidates are approved we will be subject to additional regulations regarding commercial sales and distribution.
908259_17_ITEM1_P100_S1	Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of any product candidate in those countries.
908259_17_ITEM1_P100_S2	The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
908259_17_ITEM1_P100_S3	The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
908259_17_ITEM1_P101_S0	Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAAs, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.
908259_17_ITEM1_P102_S0	single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states.
908259_17_ITEM1_P102_S1	The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions.
908259_17_ITEM1_P103_S0	Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states.
908259_17_ITEM1_P103_S1	Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval.
908259_17_ITEM1_P103_S2	If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
908259_17_ITEM1_P104_S0	As in the United States, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, may grant orphan drug status for specific indications if the request is made before an MAA is submitted.
908259_17_ITEM1_P104_S1	The EMA considers an orphan medicinal product to be one that affects less than five of every 10,000 people in the European Union.
908259_17_ITEM1_P104_S2	A company whose application for orphan drug designation in the European Union is approved is eligible to receive, among other benefits, regulatory assistance in preparing the marketing application, protocol assistance and reduced application fees.
908259_17_ITEM1_P104_S3	Orphan drugs in the European Union also enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication, unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product.
908259_17_ITEM1_P105_S0	Reimbursement Sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations.
908259_17_ITEM1_P105_S1	These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for health care products and services.
908259_17_ITEM1_P106_S0	The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products.
908259_17_ITEM1_P106_S1	Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue.
908259_17_ITEM1_P106_S2	If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
908259_17_ITEM1_P107_S0	The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposes requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries.
908259_17_ITEM1_P107_S1	Under Part D (the Medicare prescription drug benefit), Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs not covered under Medicare Part B. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs.
908259_17_ITEM1_P108_S0	Each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level.
908259_17_ITEM1_P108_S1	Federal regulations require Part D prescription drug formularies to include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, although not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class.
908259_17_ITEM1_P109_S0	In general, government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval.
908259_17_ITEM1_P109_S1	However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.
908259_17_ITEM1_P109_S2	Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.
908259_17_ITEM1_P109_S3	Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA or other Medicare regulations may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
908259_17_ITEM1_P110_S0	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Affordable Care Act or ACA,) was enacted in March 2010 and has had a significant impact on the health care industry.
908259_17_ITEM1_P110_S1	The ACA mandated prescription drug coverage as one of ten essential health benefits that most health plans must offer, requiring coverage of at least one drug in every category and class.
908259_17_ITEM1_P110_S2	The ACA also expanded coverage for the uninsured through the new health insurance exchanges and a significant increase in the number of individuals eligible for Medicaid coverage.
908259_17_ITEM1_P110_S3	The ACA also prevents health insurers from charging more, denying, or limiting coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions (i.e. individuals whose health care costs are typically higher).
908259_17_ITEM1_P111_S0	Because of the significant increase in the number of individuals covered and the expansion of the coverage that must be provided to them, commercial insurers and government programs have increased their emphasis on cost controls to reduce overall spending.
908259_17_ITEM1_P111_S1	For example, the ACA expanded and increased mandatory industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid.
908259_17_ITEM1_P112_S0	Pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide drug rebates to the federal government and most state governments in order to have the product eligible for Medicaid coverage.
908259_17_ITEM1_P112_S1	In addition, commercial insurers offering Medicaid managed care products seek to negotiate additional rebates.
908259_17_ITEM1_P113_S0	The ACA also made changes to the drug coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program.
908259_17_ITEM1_P113_S1	Although the changes have not yet been enacted, the Center for Medicine Services, or CMS, has proposed decreasing the number of categories and classes of drugs Part D plan sponsors must cover.
908259_17_ITEM1_P113_S2	Because of these cost controls, it is hard to determine what impact the ACA s expansion in coverage might have on pharmaceutical companies.
908259_17_ITEM1_P113_S3	The outcome of the recent Presidential and Congressional elections in the United States could result in significant changes in, and uncertainly with respect to, legislation, regulation and a number of government policies involving matters presently addressed by the ACA.
908259_17_ITEM1_P114_S0	The U.S. President and certain members of Congress have stated their intent to repeal the ACA and replace it with new laws and regulations.
908259_17_ITEM1_P114_S1	We expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals addressing governmental pricing controls and the growth of health care costs, including the cost of prescription drugs.
908259_17_ITEM1_P114_S2	At the present time, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies for drugs.
908259_17_ITEM1_P114_S3	Prior to the 2016 U.S. Presidential and Congressional elections, there were legislative proposals seeking to allow such direct negotiation.
908259_17_ITEM1_P114_S4	It is possible that the adoption of these or other alternative legislative or regulatory proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_17_ITEM1_P114_S5	In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed.
908259_17_ITEM1_P115_S0	The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.
908259_17_ITEM1_P115_S1	For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.
908259_17_ITEM1_P115_S2	A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.
908259_17_ITEM1_P115_S3	There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
908259_17_ITEM1_P116_S0	Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
908259_17_ITEM1_P117_S0	We actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including chemical species, compositions and forms, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, as well as modified forms of naturally-expressed receptors, in the United States and other jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets.
908259_17_ITEM1_P117_S1	We also rely upon trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information.
908259_17_ITEM1_P117_S2	As of March 30, 2017, we were the exclusive licensee, sole assignee or co-assignee of twenty-one granted U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, and granted patents and/or pending applications in several other major markets, including the European Union, Canada and Japan.
908259_17_ITEM1_P117_S3	Our policy is to file U.S. and foreign patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business.
908259_17_ITEM1_P117_S4	There can be no assurance that any of these patent applications will result in the grant of a patent either in the United States or elsewhere, or that any patents granted will be valid and enforceable, or will provide a competitive advantage or will afford protection against competitors with similar technologies.
908259_17_ITEM1_P117_S5	We also intend to rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel drugs.
908259_17_ITEM1_P117_S6	We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements.
908259_17_ITEM1_P118_S0	We consider the following U.S. patents and applications owned by or exclusively licensed to us to be particularly important to the protection of our most advanced product candidates.
908259_17_ITEM1_P119_S0	In-licensed from Arizona State University In addition to these patents, for some of our product candidates, we have patents and/or applications that cover a particular form or composition, use for a particular indication, use as part of combination therapy or method of preparation or use, as well as other pending patent applications.
908259_17_ITEM1_P119_S1	These issued patents, including any patents that issue from pending applications, could provide additional or a longer period of protection.
908259_17_ITEM1_P119_S2	We also have patent applications pending that seek equivalent or substantially comparable protection for our product candidates in jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets.
908259_17_ITEM1_P120_S0	The patent expiration dates referenced above do not reflect any potential patent term extension that we may receive under the federal Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
908259_17_ITEM1_P120_S1	The Hatch-Waxman Act generally permits a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
908259_17_ITEM1_P120_S2	Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years.
908259_17_ITEM1_P121_S0	The patent term restoration period is generally one-half of the time between the effective date of an investigational new drug application, or IND, and the submission date of a new drug application, or NDA, plus the time between the submission date and approval date of an NDA.
908259_17_ITEM1_P121_S1	Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent.
908259_17_ITEM1_P122_S0	The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for patent term extension.
908259_17_ITEM1_P123_S0	As previously noted, the FDA and European Union have granted CA4P and OXi4503 orphan drug status for certain indications.
908259_17_ITEM1_P123_S1	We are also pursuing, and may continue to in the future to pursue, orphan drug status for other product candidates and indications.
908259_17_ITEM1_P123_S2	Our ability to obtain and maintain the exclusivity for our products and product candidates by virtue of their orphan drug status is an important part of our intellectual property strategy.
908259_17_ITEM1_P124_S0	COMPETITION The industry in which we are engaged is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition.
908259_17_ITEM1_P124_S1	Our competitors include, among others, major pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, many of which have financial, technical and marketing resources significantly greater than ours.
908259_17_ITEM1_P124_S2	In addition, many of the small companies that compete with us have also formed collaborative relationships with large, established companies to support research, development, clinical trials and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours.
908259_17_ITEM1_P124_S3	Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or through joint ventures or other collaborations.
908259_17_ITEM1_P125_S0	We are aware of a limited number of companies currently or previously involved in the development of VDAs.
908259_17_ITEM1_P126_S0	If this trial is successful and BeyondSpring s drug is approved, it could constitute competition for CA4P even though the indications are different.
908259_17_ITEM1_P126_S1	We expect that, if any of our products gain regulatory approval for sale, they will compete primarily on the basis of product efficacy, safety, patient convenience, reliability, price and patent protection.
908259_17_ITEM1_P126_S2	Our competitive position will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop effective proprietary products and implement joint ventures or other alliances with large pharmaceutical companies in order to jointly market and manufacture our products.
908259_17_ITEM1_P126_S3	EMPLOYEES We expect to continue to maintain a relatively small number of executives and other employees.
908259_17_ITEM1_P126_S4	We rely on outsourcing for much of our research, development, preclinical testing and clinical trial activity, although we maintain managerial and quality control over our clinical trials.
908259_17_ITEM1_P126_S5	As of March 30, 2017, we had a total of 16 full-time employees.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	statements that may be made by us or by officers, directors or employees acting on our behalf, that are not historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from the historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors set forth below.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We need to raise additional funds to finance our operations and continue the development of our product candidates, and we may not be able to do so when necessary.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Even if we are able to raise additional funds, the terms of any financings may not be advantageous to us.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Our operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Negative cash flows from our operations are expected to continue over at least the next several years.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Our cash utilization amount is highly dependent on the product development programs we choose to pursue, the progress of these product development programs, the results of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory decisions regarding potential approval for our product candidates, the terms and conditions of our contracts with service providers for these programs, and the rate of recruitment of patients in our human clinical trials.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P1_S6	In addition, the continuation of our clinical trials, and quite possibly our entire business, will depend on results of upcoming analyses and our financial resources at the time.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P1_S7	In order to continue the development of our product candidates, we are pursuing forms of capital infusion including public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements with organizations that have capabilities, products and/or resources that are complementary to or could further extend our own capabilities, products or resources.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P1_S8	However, there can be no assurances that we will complete any financings, strategic alliances or collaborative development agreements, and the terms of such arrangements may not be advantageous to us.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Based on our current operating plans, we expect our existing cash to support our operations into approximately October 2017.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	of CA4P in combination with immune oncology agents.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Any significant further clinical development of CA4P, including the completion of the Phase 2/3 clinical trial of CA4P in ovarian cancer, and of OXi4503 would be contingent upon our ability to raise additional capital through public or private financings or from one or more new collaborative research or license agreements with a third-party, as to which we can give you no assurance.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Our ongoing capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including the progress and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates under development; the costs of complying with the FDA and other regulatory agency requirements; the progress of our research and development programs; the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals; our ability to enter into licensing arrangements, including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs; the costs and expenses of filing, prosecuting and, if necessary, enforcing our patent claims, or defending against possible claims of infringement by third-party patent or other technology rights; the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, if any, undertaken by us; and, if and when approved, the demand for our products, which demand depends in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known, understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval, including the range of indications for which any product is granted approval.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Our ability to raise additional capital was significantly impaired following the delisting of our common stock from The NASDAQ Capital Market.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P2_S4	If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we will not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we will be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs or cease operations.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P2_S5	We may seek to raise funds through public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Any additional equity or convertible debt financing may be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish, on terms that are not favorable to us, rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our failure to raise capital when needed will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Due in part to our limited financial resources, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates, and we may be unable to pursue and complete the clinical trials that we would like to pursue and complete.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	We have limited financial and technical resources to determine the indications on which we should focus the development efforts for our product candidates.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Due to our limited available financial resources, we have curtailed clinical development programs and activities that might otherwise have led to more rapid progress of our product candidates through the regulatory and development processes.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Further, our current clinical trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is designed to be larger than any other clinical trial that we have conducted previously.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P3_S6	We currently do not have the financial resources to complete this clinical trial, and cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain sufficient financial resources to complete the trial.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P3_S7	If we are forced to terminate the trial early, our chances of obtaining positive results from the clinical trial are likely to be reduced, due to the lower statistical power of smaller clinical trials.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P3_S8	We may make incorrect determinations with regard to the indications and clinical trials on which to focus the available resources that we do have.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P3_S9	Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P3_S10	We currently are pursuing clinical trials in several indications, but we are required by our financial resources to engage only in limited clinical activities.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P3_S11	The decisions to allocate our research, management and financial resources toward particular indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P3_S12	Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate drug development programs may also cause us to miss valuable opportunities.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P3_S13	In addition, from time to time, we may in-license or otherwise acquire product candidates to supplement our internal development activities.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P3_S14	Those activities may use resources that otherwise would have been devoted to our internal programs, and with research and development programs there is no way to assure that the outcome of any trials or other activities will be positive, whether the program was internally generated or in-licensed.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	If we are unable to obtain required regulatory approvals, we will be unable to market and sell our product candidates.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to development, clinical trials, manufacturing, oversight of clinical investigators, recordkeeping and commercialization.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory review and approval process are required to be successfully completed in the United States, in the European Union and in many other foreign jurisdictions before a new drug can be sold.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain, and subject to unanticipated delays.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The time required to obtain approval by the FDA or the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is unpredictable and often takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In connection with the clinical development of our product candidates, we face risks that:
908259_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	the results from clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance or clinical benefit-to-risk ratio required by the FDA, EMA or other regulatory agencies for marketing approval.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Only a small percentage of product candidates for which clinical trials are initiated are the subject of NDAs and even fewer receive approval for commercialization.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Furthermore, even if we do receive regulatory approval to market a product candidate, any such approval may be subject to limitations such as those on the indicated uses for which we may market the product.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If we or the third parties on which we rely for the conduct of our clinical trials and results do not perform our clinical trial activities in accordance with good clinical practices and related regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We currently use independent clinical investigators in all of our clinical trials and, in many cases, also utilize contract research organizations, or CROs, and other third-party service providers to conduct and/or oversee the clinical trials of our product candidates and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P6_S5	We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Nonetheless, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the FDA s requirements and our general investigational plan and protocol.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Currently, we have clinical trial activities involving CA4P and OXi4503 being conducted by clinical investigators who are independent of us, but with whom we have agreements for them to provide the results of their clinical trials to us.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P6_S8	In order for us to rely on data from these ongoing clinical trials in support of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for approval of any of our product candidates by the FDA or similar types of marketing applications that are required by other regulatory authorities, the independent investigators are required to comply with applicable good clinical practice requirements.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P6_S9	The FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities require us and our clinical investigators to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting and recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P6_S10	Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or the respective trial plans and protocols.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates or result in enforcement action against us.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We have taken and continue to take steps to strengthen our procedures and practices , but we cannot assure you that the FDA will be satisfied with our procedures or that the FDA will not issue warning letters or take other enforcement action against us in the future.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	The steps we take to strengthen our procedures and conduct future clinical trials necessary for approval will be time-consuming and expensive.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We may encounter difficulties in expanding our operations successfully if and when we evolve from a company that is primarily involved in clinical development to a company that is also involved in commercialization.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S5	As we advance our product candidates through later stages of clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S6	As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with such third parties, as well as additional collaborators, distributors, marketers and suppliers.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S7	Maintaining third party relationships for these purposes will impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management and other personnel.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S8	We must be able to manage our development efforts effectively, manage our participation in the clinical trials in which our product candidates are involved effectively, and improve our managerial, development, operational and finance systems, all of which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S9	If, following any approval of our product candidates, we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing or distribution services, any product revenues that we receive, or the profitability of these product revenues to us, are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S10	In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our products or in doing so on terms that are favorable to us.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S11	We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S12	If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our products.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S13	If we were to submit an NDA for our drug candidates in the United States or a marketing application in the EU, we would need to undertake commercial scale manufacturing activities at significant expense to us in order to proceed with the application for approval for commercialization.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S14	We or our external vendors may encounter technical difficulties that preclude us from successfully manufacturing the required registration and validation batches of active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and/or drug product and we may be unable to recover any financial losses associated with the manufacturing activities.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S15	Further, our research or product development efforts may not be successfully completed, any compounds currently under development by us may not be successfully developed into drugs, any potential products may not receive regulatory approval on a timely basis, if at all, and competitors may develop and bring to market products or technologies that render our potential products obsolete.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S16	If any of these problems occur, our business would be materially and adversely affected.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S17	We have no manufacturing capacity and have relied on, and expect to continue to rely on, third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S18	We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates or any of the compounds that we are testing in our preclinical programs, and we lack the resources and the capabilities to do so.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S19	As a result, we currently rely, and we expect to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party manufacturers to supply our product candidates.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P7_S20	Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our product candidates or products ourselves, including:
908259_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	the possible termination or non-renewal of the manufacturing agreements by the third-party, at a time that is costly or inconvenient to us.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If we do not maintain our developed important manufacturing relationships, we may fail to find replacement manufacturers or develop our own manufacturing capabilities, which could delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products and substantially increase our costs or deplete profit margins, if any.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If we do find replacement manufacturers, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us, and there could be a substantial delay before new facilities could be qualified and registered with the FDA, EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The FDA, EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities require manufacturers to register manufacturing facilities.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The FDA and corresponding foreign regulators also inspect these facilities to confirm compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Contract manufacturers may face manufacturing or quality control problems causing drug substance production and shipment delays or a situation where the contractor may not be able to maintain compliance with the applicable cGMP requirements.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Any failure to comply with cGMP requirements or other FDA, EMA and comparable foreign regulatory requirements could adversely affect our clinical research activities and our ability to develop our product candidates and market our products after approval.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our ability to develop our product candidates, our ability to commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval and our potential future profit margins on these products.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Our product candidates have not completed clinical trials, and may never demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in order to do so.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Our product candidates are in the clinical stage of development.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P9_S7	In order to achieve profitable operations, we alone or in collaboration with others, must successfully develop, manufacture, introduce and market our products.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P9_S8	The time frame necessary to achieve market success for any individual product is long and uncertain.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P9_S9	The products currently under development by us may require significant additional research and development and additional preclinical and clinical testing prior to application for commercial use.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	A number of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after showing promising results in early or later-stage studies or clinical trials.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Although we have obtained some favorable results to date in preclinical studies and clinical trials of certain of our potential products, such results may not be indicative of results that will ultimately be obtained in or throughout such clinical trials, and clinical trials may not show any of our products to be safe or capable of producing a desired result.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Additionally, we may encounter problems in our clinical trials that may cause us to delay, suspend or terminate those clinical trials.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Adverse events observed to date and associated with CA4P and OXi4503 have generally been found to be manageable for drugs treating the indications for which we are developing our product candidates.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P10_S4	However, we will be required to continue to test and evaluate the safety of our product candidates in additional clinical trials, and to demonstrate their safety to the satisfaction of appropriate regulatory agencies, as a condition to receipt of any regulatory approvals.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In clinical trials to date, transient hypertension believed to be associated with CA4P and OXi4503 has been effectively managed through pre-treatment with anti-hypertensive medication.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to make the necessary demonstrations of safety to allow us to receive regulatory approval for our product candidates in any indication.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We only have a limited number of employees to manage and operate our business.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	As of March 30, 2017, we had a total of 16 full-time employees.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Our limited financial resources require us to manage and operate our business in a highly efficient manner.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P11_S5	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We have a history of losses, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future; our auditors have included in their audit report an explanatory paragraph as to substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We have experienced net losses every year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2016, had an accumulated deficit of over $278 million.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Our auditors have included in their audit report a going concern explanatory paragraph as to substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern that assumes the realization of our assets and the satisfaction of our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We anticipate continuing to incur substantial additional losses over at least the next several years due to, among other factors, our continuing clinical trials and development activities with respect to our VDA drug candidates, technologies, and anticipated research and development activities and the general and administrative expenses associated with those activities.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P12_S4	We have not yet commercialized any product candidates.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Our ability to attain profitability will depend upon our ability to develop and commercialize products that are effective and commercially viable, to obtain regulatory approval for the manufacture and sale of our products and to license or otherwise market our products successfully.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P12_S6	We depend on our executive officers and principal consultants and the loss of their services could materially harm our business.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P12_S7	We believe that our success depends, and will likely continue to depend, upon our ability to retain the services of our current executive officers, principal consultants and others.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P12_S8	The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P12_S9	In addition, we have established relationships with universities, hospitals and research institutions, which have historically provided, and continue to provide, us with access to research laboratories, clinical trials, facilities and patients.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P12_S10	Additionally, we believe that we may, at any time and from time to time, materially depend on the services of consultants and other unaffiliated third parties.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P12_S11	We cannot assure you that consultants and other unaffiliated third parties will provide the level of service to us that we require in order to achieve our business objectives.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P12_S12	Our industry is highly competitive, and our product candidates may become obsolete.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P12_S13	We are engaged in a rapidly evolving field.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P12_S14	Competition from other pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and research and academic institutions is intense and likely to increase.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P12_S15	Many of those companies and institutions have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P12_S16	Many of those companies and institutions also have substantially greater experience in developing products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and in manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P12_S17	Our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for competitive products.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We are aware of at least four other companies that currently have a clinical-stage VDA for use in an oncology indication.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Some of these competitive products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing the desired therapeutic effect than products being developed by us.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Our competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective and/or cost competitive than those we are developing, or that would render our product candidates less competitive or even obsolete.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	In addition, one or more of our competitors may achieve product commercialization or patent protection earlier than we do, which could materially adversely affect us.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We depend extensively on the patents and proprietary technology we license from others, and we must maintain these licenses in order to preserve our business.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P14_S5	We have licensed in rights to CA4P, OXi4503 and other programs from third parties.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P14_S6	If our license agreements terminate or expire, we may lose the licensed rights to our product candidates, including CA4P and OXi4503, and we may not be able to continue to develop them or, if they are approved, we may not be able to market or commercialize them.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P14_S7	We depend on license agreements with third-parties for certain intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates, including patent rights.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	State University, or ASU, and the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company for CA4P and OXi4503 and from Baylor University for other programs.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In general, our license agreements require us to make payments and satisfy performance obligations in order to keep these agreements in effect and retain our rights under them.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	These payment obligations can include upfront fees, maintenance fees, milestones, royalties, patent prosecution expenses, and other fees.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	These performance obligations typically include diligence obligations.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	If we fail to pay, be diligent or otherwise perform as required under our license agreements, we could lose the rights under the patents and other intellectual property rights covered by the agreements.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	While we are not currently aware of any dispute with any licensors under our material agreements with them, if disputes arise under any of our in-licenses, including our in-licenses from ASU, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Baylor University, we could lose our rights under these agreements.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Any such dispute may not be resolvable on favorable terms, or at all.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Whether or not any disputes of this kind are favorably resolved, our management s time and attention and our other resources could be consumed by the need to attend to and seek to resolve these disputes and our business could be harmed by the emergence of such a dispute.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P15_S8	If we lose our rights under these agreements, we may not be able to conduct any further activities with the product candidate or program that the license covered.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P15_S9	If this were to happen, we might not be able to develop our product candidates further, or following regulatory approval, if any, we might be prohibited from marketing or commercializing them.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P15_S10	In particular, patents previously licensed to us, such as the patents we previously licensed from Angiogene, might after termination be used to stop us from conducting activities in the patents respective fields.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P15_S11	We depend on patents and proprietary technology in the course of our business, and we must protect those assets in order to preserve our business.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P15_S12	Although we expect to seek patent protection for any compounds we discover and/or for any specific use we discover for new or previously known compounds, any or all of them may not be subject to effective patent protection.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P15_S13	Further, the development of regimens for the administration of pharmaceuticals, which generally involve specifications for the frequency, timing and amount of dosages, has been, and we believe, may continue to be, important to our effort, although those processes, as such, may not be patentable.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P15_S14	In addition, the issued patents may be declared invalid or our competitors may find ways to avoid the claims in the patents.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P15_S15	Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, protect our trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We are the exclusive licensee, sole assignee or co-assignee on a number of granted United States patents, pending United States patent applications, and granted patents and/or pending applications in several other major markets, including the European Union, Canada and Japan.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms like us is generally highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions, resulting in both an apparent inconsistency regarding the breadth of claims allowed in United States patents and general uncertainty as to their legal interpretation and enforceability.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Accordingly, patent applications assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not result in patents being issued, any issued patents assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not provide us with competitive protection or may be challenged by others, and the current or future granted patents of others may have an adverse effect on our ability to do business and achieve profitability.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Moreover, because some of the basic research relating to one or more of our patent applications and/or patents were performed at various universities and/or funded by grants, one or more of these universities, employees of such universities and/or grantors could assert that they have certain rights in such research and any resulting products.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Further, others may independently develop similar products, may duplicate our products, or may design around our patent rights.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In addition, as a result of the assertion of rights by a third-party or otherwise, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of others in or outside of the United States.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Any licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights may not be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P17_S6	If we do not obtain such licenses, we could encounter delays in product market introductions while our attempts to design around such patents or could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is foreclosed.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P17_S7	In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against us or in connection with patents to which we hold licenses or in bringing suit to protect our own patents against infringement.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We require employees and the institutions that perform our preclinical and clinical trials to enter into confidentiality agreements with us.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Those agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to a party to any such agreement during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third-parties, except in specific circumstances.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Any such agreement may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	The use of our products may result in product liability exposure, and it is uncertain whether our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all claims.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	The use of our product candidates in clinical trials may expose us to liability claims in the event such product candidates cause death, injury or disease, or result in adverse effects.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P18_S5	We may be exposed to liability claims even if our product did not cause death, injury or diseases, but is merely presumed or alleged to have caused any of these.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P18_S6	If our product candidates are ever commercially approved, the commercial use of these products may also expose us to similar liability claims.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Any of these claims could be made by health care institutions, contract laboratories, patients or others using such products.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Although we have obtained liability insurance coverage for our ongoing clinical trials, this coverage may not be in amounts sufficient to protect us from any product liability claims or product recalls which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P18_S9	Further, adverse product and similar liability claims could negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our technology and product candidates under development.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P18_S10	If clinical trials or regulatory approval processes for our product candidates are prolonged, delayed or suspended, we may be unable to out-license or commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis, which would require us to incur additional costs and delay or prevent our receipt of any proceeds from potential license agreements or product sales.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P18_S11	We cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or any regulatory authority to delay or suspend those clinical trials or delay or invalidate the analysis of data derived from them.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P18_S12	A number of events, including any of the following, could delay the completion of our other ongoing and planned clinical trials and negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and to market and sell, a particular product candidate:
908259_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	failure of our third-party contractors to comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise meet their contractual obligations to us.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Commercialization or licensure of our product candidates may be delayed or prevented by the imposition of additional conditions on our clinical trials by the FDA, EMA or another foreign regulatory authority or the requirement of additional supportive clinical trials by the FDA, EMA or another foreign regulatory authority.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	the same patients as our clinical trials, and the eligibility criteria for our clinical trials.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our failure to enroll patients in our clinical trials could delay the completion of the clinical trial beyond our expectations, or it could prevent us from being able to complete the clinical trial.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, the FDA and EMA could require us to conduct clinical trials with a larger number of subjects than we have projected for any of our product candidates.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in a timely or cost-effective manner.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Furthermore, enrolled patients may drop out of our clinical trials, which could impair the validity or statistical significance of the clinical trials.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P20_S5	We do not know whether our clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured, or will be completed on schedule, if at all.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Delays in our clinical trials will result in increased development costs for our product candidates, and our financial resources may be insufficient to fund any incremental costs.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P20_S7	In addition, if our clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be limited.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P20_S8	We have been granted orphan drug status for certain of our product candidates and may seek orphan drug status for additional indications for those product candidates or for additional product candidates.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P20_S9	We may be unsuccessful in maintaining orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates and may be unsuccessful in our efforts to seek orphan drug status and orphan drug exclusivity.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In the European Union and Japan, orphan drug exclusivity regulations provide for 10 years of marketing exclusivity for orphan drugs that are approved for the treatment of rare diseases or conditions.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Our product candidate, CA4P, has been awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of anaplastic, medullary, Stage IV papillary and Stage IV follicular thyroid cancers, ovarian cancer, neuroendocrine tumors and glioma.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Our product candidate, OXi4503, has been awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P21_S5	CA4P has also been awarded orphan drug status by the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer, ovarian cancer and neuroendocrine tumors.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P21_S6	OXi4503 has been awarded orphan drug status by the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the EMA or the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication during the period of exclusivity.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P21_S8	The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in the European Union.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P21_S9	The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P21_S10	Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or the EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective, if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P21_S11	Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product candidate or additional product candidates, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product candidate from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P21_S12	Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve a different drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P21_S13	Our product candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory review even if they receive marketing approval, and if we fail to comply with continuing regulations, we could lose these approvals and the sale of any approved commercial products could be suspended.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P21_S14	Even if we receive regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, and record keeping related to the product will remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	requirements of the FDA, EMA and other applicable domestic and foreign regulatory authorities or previously unknown problems with any approved product, manufacturer, or manufacturing process are discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:
908259_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If physicians and patients do not accept our future products or if the market for indications for which any product candidate is approved is smaller than expected, we may be unable to generate significant revenue, if any.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Even if any of our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, and third-party payers.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Physicians may decide not to prescribe our drugs for a variety of reasons including:
908259_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	ineffective marketing and distribution support of our products.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If any of our product candidates is approved, but fails to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenue and our business would suffer.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	The uncertainty associated with pharmaceutical reimbursement and related matters may adversely affect our business.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Market acceptance and sales of any one or more of our product candidates that we develop will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will cover and establish payment levels.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We cannot be certain that reimbursement will be available for any product candidates that we develop.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Also, we cannot be certain that reimbursement policies will not reduce the demand for, or the price paid for, our products.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	If reimbursement is not available or is available on a limited basis, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidates that we develop.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The legislation established Medicare Part D, which expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drug purchases by the elderly but provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The United States and several foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any products that we develop due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, ACA, became law in the U.S.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The goal of ACA is to reduce the cost of health care and substantially change the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	While we cannot predict what impact on federal reimbursement policies this legislation will have in general or on our business specifically, the ACA may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of, and the price we may charge for, any products we develop that receive regulatory approval.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P29_S3	We also cannot predict the impact of ACA on us as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions, which have not yet been fully implemented.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P29_S4	More recently, the current U.S. presidential administration has made statements suggesting plans to seek repeal of all or portions of the ACA, and the U.S. Congress is considering such repeal or partial repeal and replacement.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P29_S5	There is uncertainty regarding the impact that the President s administration may have on matters currently governed by the ACA, if any, and any regulatory or legislative changes will likely take time to unfold.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P29_S6	These changes could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the ACA.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P29_S7	However, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Our operations and the financial results of our operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Global financial concerns have caused, and may continue to cause, extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P31_S4	A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P31_S5	We cannot currently anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P31_S7	Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our third-party CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P31_S8	Furthermore, we have little or no control over the security measures and computer systems of our third-party CROs and other contractors and consultants.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	For example, the loss of clinical trial data for our product candidates could result in delays in our marketing approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating to our technology or product candidates, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Our employees, principal investigators, CROs and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P32_S3	We are exposed to the risk that our employees, principal investigators, CROs and consultants may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violate the regulations of the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such authorities; healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad; or laws that require the reporting of financial information or data accurately.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P32_S5	In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P32_S6	Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or creating fraudulent data in our preclinical studies or clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P32_S7	We have a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P32_S8	Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P32_S9	If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P32_S10	We, or the third parties upon whom we depend, may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P32_S11	Earthquakes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P32_S12	If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P32_S13	The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P32_S14	We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P32_S15	The price of our common stock is volatile, and is likely to continue to fluctuate due to reasons beyond our control; a limited public trading market may cause volatility in the price of our common stock.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P32_S16	The market price of our common stock has been, and likely will continue to be, highly volatile.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P32_S17	Factors, including our financial results or our competitors financial results, clinical trial and research development announcements and government regulatory action affecting our potential products in both the United States and foreign countries, have had, and may continue to have, a significant effect on our results of operations and on the market price of our common stock.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	One or more of these factors could significantly harm our business and cause a decline in the price of our common stock in the public market.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Substantially all of the shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants have been registered or are likely to be registered for resale or are available for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and may be sold from time to time.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Such sales, as well as future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders, or the perception that sales may occur at any time, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQX marketplace.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	The quotation of our common stock on the OTCQX marketplace does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market currently exists, and in recent years such market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many smaller companies like us.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Our common stock is subject to this volatility.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock and our stock price may decline substantially in a short time and our stockholders could suffer losses or be unable to liquidate their holdings.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P35_S4	We may not be able to achieve secondary trading of our stock in certain states because our common stock is no longer nationally traded, which could subject our stockholders to significant restrictions and costs.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Our common stock is not currently eligible for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market or on a national securities exchange.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P35_S6	Therefore, our common stock is subject to the securities laws of the various states and jurisdictions of the United States in addition to federal securities law.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P35_S7	While we may register our common stock or qualify for exemptions for our common stock in one of more states, if we fail to do so the investors in those states where we have not taken such steps may not be allowed to purchase our stock or those who presently hold our stock may not be able to resell their shares without substantial effort and expense.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P35_S8	These restrictions and potential costs could be significant burdens on our stockholders.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and the trading price of our stock.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	If we cannot maintain effective controls and reliable financial reports, our business and operating results could be harmed.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	For example, during the third quarter of 2013, our management determined that we had a material weakness related to the operation of our controls over financial reporting associated with a complex non-routine financing transaction in the second quarter of 2013.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P37_S3	We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework).
908259_17_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P37_S5	We continue to work on maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting; however, there can be no assurance that another material weakness will not occur in the future.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P37_S6	Any failure to implement and maintain controls over our financial reporting or difficulties encountered in the implementation of improvements in our controls, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P37_S7	Any failure to maintain our internal controls over financial reporting or to address identified weaknesses in the future, if they were to occur, could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P37_S8	Issuance of additional equity securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P37_S9	We are currently authorized to issue up to 70,000,000 shares of our common stock and 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P37_S10	As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 26,545,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, and we had no shares of preferred stock outstanding.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P37_S11	As of December 31, 2016, we also had approximately 9,842,000 warrants and 4,177,000 options outstanding.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	To the extent that shares of common stock are issued or options and warrants are exercised, holders of our common stock will experience dilution.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	In addition, in the event of any future issuances of equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, holders of our common stock may experience dilution.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Moreover, our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Our board of directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, conversion rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or if we liquidate, dissolve or wind up our business and other terms.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	If we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decrease.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Any provision permitting the conversion of any such preferred stock into our common stock could result in significant dilution to the holders of our common stock.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P39_S4	We also consider from time to time various strategic alternatives that could involve issuances of additional common stock, including but not limited to acquisitions and business combinations, but do not currently have any definitive plans to enter into any of these transactions.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P39_S5	We have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, and you may not receive funds without selling your common stock.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P39_S6	We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, nor do we expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P39_S7	We currently intend to retain any future earnings, if any, to finance our operations and growth and, potentially, for future stock repurchases and, therefore, we have no plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P39_S8	Any future determination to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, any contractual restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P39_S9	Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your common stock in order to generate cash from your investment in Mateon Therapeutics, Inc.
908259_17_ITEM1A_P39_S10	You may not receive a gain on your investment when you sell our common stock and may lose the entire amount of your investment.
908259_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	We believe that these facilities will meet our needs for the foreseeable future.
908259_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Effective December 8, 2016, the Company s common stock began trading on the OTCQX Market, operated by OTC Markets, under the symbol MATN .
908259_17_ITEM5_P0_S1	From June 20, 2016 to December 8, 2016, the Company s common stock was traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol MATN .
908259_17_ITEM5_P0_S2	Prior to June 20, 2016, the Company s common stock was traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol OXGN .
908259_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	to the nearest cent, on the OTCQX Market and on The NASDAQ Capital Market, as applicable, as reported by each of the markets, for each quarterly period during the two most recent fiscal years.
908259_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of March 30, 2017, there were approximately 41 stockholders of record of the 26,544,934 outstanding shares of the Company s common stock.
908259_17_ITEM5_P2_S1	The Company has not declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock since its inception in 1988, and does not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
908259_17_ITEM5_P2_S2	The Company presently intends to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of its business.
908259_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
908259_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or outcomes to be materially different from those anticipated and discussed herein.
908259_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	Important factors that we believe may cause such differences are discussed in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report and in the Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 section of this Annual Report.
908259_17_ITEM7_P0_S3	In assessing forward-looking statements contained herein, readers are urged to read carefully all Risk Factors and cautionary statements contained in this Annual Report.
908259_17_ITEM7_P0_S4	Further, we operate in an industry sector where securities prices are volatile and may be influenced by regulatory and other factors beyond our control.
908259_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of vascular disrupting agents, or VDAs, for the treatment of cancer.
908259_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	VDAs selectively target the vasculature of cancer tumors and obstruct a tumor s blood supply without disrupting the blood supply to normal tissues.
908259_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	Treatment with VDAs has been shown to lead to significant central tumor necrosis, which refers to the death of cancer cells.
908259_17_ITEM7_P1_S3	Unlike most other drugs used for the treatment of cancer, our investigational drugs have consistently shown a stronger treatment effect in larger tumors than in smaller tumors.
908259_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	VDAs are in a class of drugs called vascular targeted therapies, or VTTs, which also includes anti-angiogenic agents, or AAs.
908259_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	Bevacizumab (marketed under the brand name Avastin by Roche/Genentech) and other currently-approved AA drugs work by preventing the growth of new blood vessels which can supply nutrients to tumor cells.
908259_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	We are seeking to realize the full potential of VTTs in oncology by using the combination of VDAs and AAs to treat cancer tumors.
908259_17_ITEM7_P2_S3	The aim of using a VDA and an AA in combination is for the VDA to directly cut-off the blood supply to the majority of the tumor, while the AA indirectly inhibits angiogenesis, which is the process by which new blood vessels form and re-vascularize the tumor.
908259_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	VDA development plans are focused on this combination so that the mechanism of action of each drug would complement that of the other disrupting tumor blood supply in two different ways instead of just one.
908259_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	We have two clinical stage investigational drugs, both VDAs, that we are currently developing CA4P and OXi4503.
908259_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	Our lead compound is CA4P. The largest clinical trial of CA4P conducted to date was a phase 2 clinical trial in recurrent ovarian cancer sponsored by the Gynecologic Oncology Group, or GOG, which was completed in 2014 and met its primary endpoint by demonstrating an improvement in progression-free survival for the patients who received CA4P. This trial, referred to as GOG-0186I, compared treatment with CA4P plus bevacizumab to treatment with bevacizumab alone.
908259_17_ITEM7_P3_S3	Based on the positive results of this clinical trial, we are conducting a two-stage, phase 2/3 clinical trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, which will compare treatment with CA4P, bevacizumab and chemotherapy, or the active treatment arm, to treatment with bevacizumab and chemotherapy, or the control arm.
908259_17_ITEM7_P3_S4	CA4P is also being studied in combination with pazopanib in an on-going phase 2 clinical trial in recurrent ovarian cancer, called PAZOFOS, that is sponsored by The Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in the United Kingdom.
908259_17_ITEM7_P3_S5	Our second compound, OXi4503, is being studied in combination with cytarabine in a phase 1/2 clinical trial in the United States in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
908259_17_ITEM7_P3_S6	During 2016, our resources were focused primarily on initiating our two-stage, phase 2/3 clinical trial of CA4P in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, called FOCUS, activating clinical sites for the FOCUS study and enrolling patients into both our FOCUS study and our phase 1/2 OXi4503 study in AML.
908259_17_ITEM7_P3_S7	In addition, we completed a phase 2 study of CA4P in neuroendocrine tumors, or NETs and supported the advancement of PAZOFOS into its phase 2 portion.
908259_17_ITEM7_P3_S8	During 2015, our resources were focused primarily on evaluating the potential clinical pathways for CA4P in ovarian cancer and other cancers, planning a phase 2/3 clinical trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, and continuation of a phase 2 clinical trial in NETs.
908259_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
908259_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time we make such estimates.
908259_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from our estimates, judgments and assumptions.
908259_17_ITEM7_P4_S3	We periodically review our estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience.
908259_17_ITEM7_P4_S4	The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate.
908259_17_ITEM7_P4_S5	Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
908259_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles.
908259_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	We believe the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments are the following: Research and development expenses Research and development expenses consist of costs we incur for the development of our investigational drugs and, to a lesser extent, for preclinical research activities.
908259_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
908259_17_ITEM7_P5_S3	Research and development expenses include clinical trial costs, salaries and benefits of employees, including associated stock-based compensation, payments to clinical investigators, drug manufacturing costs, laboratory supplies and facility costs.
908259_17_ITEM7_P5_S4	Clinical trial costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses, and these can be difficult to accurately estimate.
908259_17_ITEM7_P5_S5	Included in clinical trial costs are fees paid to other entities that conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf, such as clinical research organizations, or CROs.
908259_17_ITEM7_P5_S6	We estimate clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions such as CROs and the actual clinical investigators.
908259_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	on actual time and expenses incurred by the CRO and the clinical investigators.
908259_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	Also included in clinical trial expenses are costs based on the level of patient enrollment into the clinical trial and the actual services performed under the related clinical trial agreement.
908259_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	Changes in clinical trial assumptions, such as the length of time estimated to enroll all patients, rate of screening failures, patient drop-out rates, number and nature of adverse event reports and the total number of patients enrolled can impact the average and expected cost per patient and the overall cost of the clinical trial.
908259_17_ITEM7_P6_S3	Based on patient enrollment reports and services provided, we may periodically adjust estimates for the clinical trial costs.
908259_17_ITEM7_P6_S4	If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed, the length of time for these services or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates.
908259_17_ITEM7_P6_S5	Although we have not experienced significant changes in our estimates of clinical trial accruals to date, investors should be aware that our FOCUS clinical trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is expected to be larger than any other clinical trial that we have conducted previously.
908259_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Share-based compensation We record the estimated fair value of all share-based payments issued to employees and other service providers.
908259_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	Share-based payments consist primarily of stock options.
908259_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	The valuation of stock options is an inherently subjective process, since market values are not available for long-term, non-transferable stock options in our equity securities.
908259_17_ITEM7_P7_S3	Accordingly, we use a Black-Scholes option pricing model to derive an estimated fair value of the stock options which we issue.
908259_17_ITEM7_P7_S4	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires certain input assumptions, including the expected term of the options and the expected volatility of our common stock.
908259_17_ITEM7_P7_S5	Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value that we record for share-based payments that we issue.
908259_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	We determine the term of the options based on the simplified method, which averages the vesting period and the contractual life of the stock option.
908259_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	We determine the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term.
908259_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Black-Scholes option pricing model also requires assumptions for risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock, but we feel that these values are more objective and note that changes in these values do not have a significant impact on the estimated value of the options when compared to the volatility and term assumptions.
908259_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	We are also required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
908259_17_ITEM7_P9_S3	Accordingly, we perform a historical analysis of option awards that are forfeited prior to vesting, and record total stock option expense that reflects this estimated forfeiture rate.
908259_17_ITEM7_P9_S4	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 Research and Development expenses The table below summarizes the most significant components of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated and provides the amount and percentage change in these components (in thousands):
908259_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	In 2016 research and development expenses decreased approximately 4% compared to 2015, mostly due to lower costs paid for consulting and professional services, partially offset by higher employee compensation and clinical study expenses.
908259_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	Higher expenses were incurred for clinical studies in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to the mid-2016 initiation of the phase 2/3 FOCUS study of CA4P in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
908259_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	FOCUS currently represents the most advanced clinical study for our lead investigational drug.
908259_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	There were no comparable costs for FOCUS in 2015.
908259_17_ITEM7_P10_S4	In addition, higher costs were incurred for OX1222, evaluating OXi4503 in AML, after this clinical trial was expanded in late 2015.
908259_17_ITEM7_P10_S5	Partially offsetting the higher costs incurred for FOCUS and OX1222 were lower expenses for the NET study, for which we completed patient visits in mid-2016 compared to a full year for 2015.
908259_17_ITEM7_P10_S6	Employee compensation and related expenses increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to our mid-to-late 2015 hiring of additional research and development personnel to support our drug development programs, including the FOCUS study for CA4P. Expenses for these employees were incurred for all of 2016 compared to only a portion of 2015.
908259_17_ITEM7_P10_S7	In addition to supporting the FOCUS study, we hired these employees to reduce our reliance on outside consultants to conduct similar work.
908259_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Employee stock-based compensation decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to vesting of certain options during 2015.
908259_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	The decrease in consulting and professional services for 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to a lower level of use of outside consultants after we hired additional research and development employees during the second half of 2015.
908259_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	In addition, during 2015 we incurred a higher level of consulting costs as we sought additional outside expertise as we evaluated various development strategies for CA4P. Timing of drug manufacturing costs is variable and is impacted by the timing of when drug product is needed for clinical trials, product expiration or re-test requirements, potential regulatory filings and scheduling of production batches based on the drug manufacturer s generally long lead time requirements.
908259_17_ITEM7_P11_S3	During 2016 and 2015, we did not need to manufacture any new batches of our investigational drugs.
908259_17_ITEM7_P11_S4	Costs for both years were generally limited to required packaging and labeling for clinical trials, drug stability and other work to support our investigational drugs.
908259_17_ITEM7_P11_S5	Other expenses include facility related expenses and licensing fees which decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower licensing fees paid for rights to our drug product candidates.
908259_17_ITEM7_P11_S6	Because we plan to continue our FOCUS study of CA4P in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and continue with our OX1222 study of OXi4503 in AML in 2017, subject to available funding to continue those trials, we expect research and development expenses to increase in 2017, particularly for clinical studies.
908259_17_ITEM7_P11_S7	General and administrative expenses The table below summarizes the most significant components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated and the amount and percentage change in these components (in thousands):
908259_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	In 2016 general and administrative expenses increased approximately 9% compared to 2015, mostly due to higher costs for stock-based compensation.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	for 2016 compared to only a portion of 2015, as well as higher housing costs associated with employee relocation in 2016, partially offset by lower severance expense in 2016.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	The increase in employee stock-based compensation in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to the 2016 vesting of stock options granted shortly after stockholder approval of a new option plan in mid-2015, higher levels of stock options granted during 2016 and options granted during 2016 to new directors appointed to our board.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	Consulting and professional services expenses increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to higher legal and business development costs.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S3	Other expenses, which include facility related expenses, insurance expenses and taxes that are not based on income decreased for 2016 compared to 2015 due to lower fees paid in several different areas, none of which were individually significant.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S4	We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in 2017 to support our planned increase in clinical development activities, as well as for additional business development and investor relations efforts.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S5	We are developing two investigational drugs, both VDAs, for the treatment of cancer and currently have no sources of revenue.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S6	We measure liquidity by the cash and other capital we have available to fund our operations, which are primarily focused on the advancement of our VDAs.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S7	To date, we have financed our operations principally through proceeds received from the sale of equity.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S8	We have experienced net losses in each year since our inception, and negative cash flows from operations in nearly every year.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S9	As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of over $278 million, including a net loss of approximately $13.7 million in 2016, and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $12.0 million, which we expect to be sufficient to fund our operations into approximately October 2017.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S10	If we are unable to secure additional funding prior to that date, we may be required to scale back or conclude our development activities altogether.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S11	If we are able to secure additional funding to continue our operations, we expect to incur significant additional costs and expenses over at least the next several years as a result of our plans to develop VDAs for the treatment of cancer, including continuing our existing clinical trials as well as conducting new, additional clinical trials and anticipated research and development expenditures.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S12	We anticipate that our development will include continuing our current clinical trials as well as new clinical trials and additional research and development expenditures.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S13	No cash was provided by financing activities in 2016.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S14	Cash provided by financing activities of $9.2 million in 2015 represents proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S15	We will require additional capital before we can complete all planned clinical trials and development of CA4P and OXi4503.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S16	Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S17	If we are unable to access additional funds when needed we may not be able to continue the development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and operations.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S18	Any additional equity financing, if available, may not be available on favorable terms and would be dilutive to our current stockholders.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S19	Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could also be dilutive to our current stockholders.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S20	If we are able to access funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own, on terms that are not favorable to us.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S21	Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_17_ITEM7_P13_S22	Our ability to raise additional capital was significantly impaired following our delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market in December 2016.
908259_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	The following table presents information regarding our non-cancelable contractual obligations, which consists of our facility lease, as of December 31, 2016:
908259_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our current drug development programs are based on a series of compounds called combretastatins, which we have exclusively licensed from Arizona State University, or ASU.
908259_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	If our current drug candidates are approved, we will be required to pay low to mid-single-digit royalties on future net sales of products associated with the ASU patent rights until these patent rights expire.
908259_17_ITEM7_P15_S2	We also have an exclusive license from Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, for certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including CA4P.
908259_17_ITEM7_P15_S3	If CA4P is approved, we will be required to pay low-single-digit royalties on future net sales of products associated with the BMS patent rights until these patent rights expire.
908259_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We have adopted an Investment Policy, the primary objectives of which are to preserve principal, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields while preserving principal.
908259_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Although our investments are subject to credit risk, we follow procedures to limit the amount of credit exposure in any single issue, issuer or type of investment.
908259_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase.
908259_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	However, due to the generally conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration, we believe that interest rate risk is mitigated.
908259_17_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in U.S. dollar accounts.
908259_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Although we may from time to time manufacture drugs and conduct trials and studies outside of the United States, we believe our exposure to foreign currency risk to be immaterial.
908259_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	See Item 15 for a list of our Financial Statements and Schedules and any supplementary financial information filed as part of this Annual Report.
908259_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of our Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Securities and Exchange Commission requires that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and the Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) and report on the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
908259_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of December 31, 2016, to ensure that we record, process, summarize and report the information we must disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
908259_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, identified in connection with the evaluation of such control that occurred during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
908259_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
908259_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework).
908259_17_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016.
908259_17_ITEM9A_P1_S4	This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
908259_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC.
908259_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud.
908259_17_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time.
908259_17_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.
908259_17_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Because we are not an accelerated filer, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, OUM Co., LLP was not required to issue an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting and, therefore, did not perform for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 an audit of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

908259_17_ITEM15_P6_S0	The following financial statements of Mateon Therapeutics, Inc.:
908259_17_ITEM15_P7_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Mateon Therapeutics, Inc.
908259_17_ITEM15_P7_S1	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Mateon Therapeutics, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of comprehensive loss, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2016.
908259_17_ITEM15_P7_S2	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
908259_17_ITEM15_P7_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
908259_17_ITEM15_P7_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
908259_17_ITEM15_P7_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
908259_17_ITEM15_P7_S6	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
908259_17_ITEM15_P7_S7	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
908259_17_ITEM15_P7_S8	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
908259_17_ITEM15_P8_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
908259_17_ITEM15_P8_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
908259_17_ITEM15_P8_S2	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mateon Therapeutics, Inc. at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
908259_17_ITEM15_P8_S3	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
908259_17_ITEM15_P8_S4	As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
908259_17_ITEM15_P8_S5	Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2.
908259_17_ITEM15_P8_S6	The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
908259_17_ITEM15_P9_S0	Statements of Stockholders Equity (in thousands) See accompanying notes.
908259_17_ITEM15_P10_S0	Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands) See accompanying notes.
908259_17_ITEM15_P11_S0	MATEON THERAPEUTICS, INC. Notes to Financial Statements December 31, 2016 1.
908259_17_ITEM15_P11_S1	Description of Business Mateon Therapeutics, Inc. ( Mateon or the Company ) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company seeking to realize the full potential of vascular targeted therapy in oncology.
908259_17_ITEM15_P11_S2	Vascular targeted therapy includes vascular disrupting agents (VDAs), such as the investigational drugs that Mateon is developing, and anti-angiogenic agents (AAs), a number of which are approved and widely used in oncology indications.
908259_17_ITEM15_P11_S3	Mateon s VDAs selectively obstruct a tumor s blood supply without obstructing the blood supply to normal tissues, and treatment with Mateon s VDAs has been shown to lead to significant central tumor necrosis.
908259_17_ITEM15_P11_S4	The Company believes that the treatment of cancer would be significantly improved if VDAs and AAs were used together, due to their complementary mechanisms of action.
908259_17_ITEM15_P11_S5	In combination, the VDA would occlude the blood vessels in the interior of a tumor while the AA would prevent the formation of new tumor blood vessels.
908259_17_ITEM15_P12_S0	The Company has two VDA drug candidates currently being tested in clinical trials, CA4P (combretastatin A4 phosphate, or fosbretabulin) and OXi4503.
908259_17_ITEM15_P13_S0	The Company was originally incorporated under the name OXiGENE, Inc. in 1988 in the state of New York and reincorporated in 1992 in the state of Delaware.
908259_17_ITEM15_P13_S1	Effective June 17, 2016, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to change its name to Mateon Therapeutics, Inc. 2.
908259_17_ITEM15_P14_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
908259_17_ITEM15_P14_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
908259_17_ITEM15_P15_S0	Cash Equivalents Highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.
908259_17_ITEM15_P15_S1	Cash equivalents are stated at fair value.
908259_17_ITEM15_P16_S0	Short-term Investments All marketable securities have been classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, based upon quoted market prices.
908259_17_ITEM15_P16_S1	The Company considers its available-for-sale portfolio to be available for use in current operations.
908259_17_ITEM15_P16_S2	Accordingly, the Company classifies certain investments as short-term marketable securities, even though the stated maturity date may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet date.
908259_17_ITEM15_P17_S0	Unrealized gains and losses, if material, net of any related tax effects, are excluded from earnings and are included in other comprehensive income and reported as a separate component of stockholders deficit until realized.
908259_17_ITEM15_P18_S0	Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary, if any, on available-for-sale securities are included in other income (expense), net.
908259_17_ITEM15_P19_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method.
908259_17_ITEM15_P19_S1	Concentration of Credit Risk The Company has no significant off balance sheet concentrations of credit risk.
908259_17_ITEM15_P19_S2	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and short-term investments, which consist of U.S. government treasury bills, corporate bonds and commercial paper.
908259_17_ITEM15_P19_S3	The Company holds its cash and short-term investments with one financial institution.
908259_17_ITEM15_P20_S0	MATEON THERAPEUTICS, INC. Notes to Financial Statements (Continued) Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company measures and reports its cash equivalents and investments at fair value.
908259_17_ITEM15_P21_S0	Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
908259_17_ITEM15_P22_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are recorded and stated at cost.
908259_17_ITEM15_P23_S0	Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years, or the applicable lease term, whichever is less.
908259_17_ITEM15_P24_S0	The Company utilizes contract research organizations (CROs), independent clinical investigators, and other third-party service providers to assist with the execution of its clinical trials.
908259_17_ITEM15_P24_S1	The Company records costs for clinical trial activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced for each clinical trial, and includes these costs in accrued liabilities on its Balance Sheets and within research and development expenses on its Statements of Comprehensive Loss.
908259_17_ITEM15_P24_S2	Contracts for clinical trials vary significantly in length and are usually composed of a fixed management fee, variable indirect reimbursable costs, monthly costs and amounts owed on a per patient basis.
908259_17_ITEM15_P24_S3	The Company monitors both the activity and patient enrollment levels of each clinical trial to the extent possible through communication with each service provider, detailed invoice and task completion review, analysis of actual expenses against budget, pre-approval of any changes in scope, and review of contractual terms.
908259_17_ITEM15_P24_S4	As a result, accrued clinical trial expenses represent the Company s reasonably estimated contractual liability to outside service providers at any particular point in time.
908259_17_ITEM15_P24_S5	These estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the service providers as determined by actual patient enrollment levels and other variable activity costs.
908259_17_ITEM15_P25_S0	Research and Development Expenses The Company charges all research and development costs, both internal and external, to expense when incurred.
908259_17_ITEM15_P25_S1	The Company s research and development expenses consist primarily of clinical trial expenses, personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, costs associated with manufacturing the Company s drug product for clinical use and required regulatory filings, licenses and fees, and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facility-related costs.
908259_17_ITEM15_P25_S2	Clinical trial expenses represent a significant component of the Company s research and development expenses.
908259_17_ITEM15_P25_S3	A large portion of the costs for the Company s clinical trials are paid to or through CROs.
908259_17_ITEM15_P25_S4	The Company monitors levels of services provided under each significant contract including the extent of patient enrollment and other activities through communications with its CROs and with investigator sites.
908259_17_ITEM15_P25_S5	Costs are accrued for clinical studies performed by CROs over the service periods specified in the contracts and estimates are adjusted, if required, based upon ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs.
908259_17_ITEM15_P26_S0	The manufacturing of the Company s drug investigational drugs is outsourced to third-party manufacturers.
908259_17_ITEM15_P26_S1	The drug manufacturing costs are expensed as incurred.
908259_17_ITEM15_P26_S2	For the periods presented, there are no components of other comprehensive income or accumulated comprehensive income and the net loss is equal to the comprehensive loss.
908259_17_ITEM15_P27_S0	Stock-based Compensation The Company expenses the estimated fair value of all share-based payments issued to employees on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
908259_17_ITEM15_P27_S1	The Company has equity incentive plans that provides for the award of stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights to employees, directors and consultants to the Company.
908259_17_ITEM15_P28_S0	The Company has filed applications for patents in connection with various product candidates and technologies being developed.
908259_17_ITEM15_P28_S1	Costs associated with patent applications and maintaining patents are expensed as general and administrative expense as incurred.
908259_17_ITEM15_P29_S0	Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method whereby tax rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes based on when and how they are expected to affect the tax return.
908259_17_ITEM15_P29_S1	The Company reviews all activity subsequent to year end but prior to the issuance of the financial statements for events that could require disclosure or which could impact the carrying value of assets or liabilities as of the balance sheet date.
908259_17_ITEM15_P30_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-2, Leases.
908259_17_ITEM15_P30_S1	This ASU requires substantially all leases, including operating leases, to be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability.
908259_17_ITEM15_P30_S2	This ASU is effective for the Company s interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted.
908259_17_ITEM15_P30_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on its financial statements.
908259_17_ITEM15_P30_S4	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments, including immediate recognition of all excess tax benefits and deficiencies in the income statement, changing the threshold to qualify for equity classification up to the employees maximum statutory tax rates, allowing an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur, and clarifying the classification on the statement of cash flows for the excess tax benefit and employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes.
908259_17_ITEM15_P30_S5	This ASU is effective for the Company s interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2017 and early adoption is permitted.
908259_17_ITEM15_P30_S6	The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its financial statements.
908259_17_ITEM15_P31_S0	The Company has experienced net losses every year since inception and, as of December 31, 2016, had an accumulated deficit of over $278 million.
908259_17_ITEM15_P31_S1	The company has no source of revenue and does not expect to receive any product revenue in the near future.
908259_17_ITEM15_P31_S2	The Company expects to incur significant additional operating losses over at least the next several years, principally as a result of the Company s continuing clinical trials for its investigational drugs.
908259_17_ITEM15_P32_S0	The principal source of the Company s working capital to date has been the proceeds from the sale of equity.
908259_17_ITEM15_P33_S0	Based on the Company s planned operations, Management expects Mateon s existing cash and short-term investments to support operations into October 2017.
908259_17_ITEM15_P33_S1	Prior to this time, the Company will need to secure additional funding or could be forced to curtail or terminate operations.
908259_17_ITEM15_P33_S2	Because the Company does not currently have a guaranteed source of working capital that will sustain operations past October 2017, Management has determined that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
908259_17_ITEM15_P33_S3	The Company will need to raise capital in order to fund its operations beyond this date.
908259_17_ITEM15_P33_S4	If the Company is unable to access additional funds when needed, it may not be able to continue the development of its investigational drugs and the Company could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of its development programs and other operations.
908259_17_ITEM15_P33_S5	Any additional equity financing, if available to the Company, may not be available on favorable terms, would most likely be dilutive to its current stockholders and debt financing, if available, and may involve restrictive covenants.
908259_17_ITEM15_P33_S6	If the Company accesses funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, it may be required to relinquish rights to some of its technologies or product candidates that it would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on its own, on terms that are not favorable to the Company.
908259_17_ITEM15_P33_S7	The Company s ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, will materially harm its business, financial condition and results of operations.

908259_17_ITEM15_P36_S1	Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters.
908259_17_ITEM15_P36_S2	Where observable prices or parameters are not available, valuation models are applied.
908259_17_ITEM15_P37_S0	Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value.
908259_17_ITEM15_P37_S1	Hierarchical levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities are as follows: Level 1 Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the reporting date.
908259_17_ITEM15_P38_S0	Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide reasonably accurate pricing information on an ongoing basis.
908259_17_ITEM15_P39_S0	Level 2 Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the reporting date and for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life.
908259_17_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Company utilizes third party pricing services in developing fair value measurements where fair value is based on observable market inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers and other reference data.
908259_17_ITEM15_P39_S2	The Company uses quotes from external pricing service providers and other on-line quotation systems to verify the fair value of investments provided by third party pricing service providers.
908259_17_ITEM15_P40_S0	Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the reporting date.
908259_17_ITEM15_P41_S0	Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.
908259_17_ITEM15_P42_S0	Financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are categorized in the tables below based upon the lowest level of significant input to the valuations (in thousands): 5.

908259_17_ITEM15_P44_S3	Options to purchase common stock may no longer be made under the 2005 Plan, although options previously granted remain outstanding in accordance with their terms.
908259_17_ITEM15_P44_S4	Under the 2015 Plan, up to 4,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock may be issued pursuant to awards granted in the form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted and unrestricted stock awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, consultants, and directors.

908259_17_ITEM15_P44_S6	Under the 2005 Plan, up to 726,000 shares of the Company s common may be issued or transferred to the 2015 Plan.
908259_17_ITEM15_P45_S0	The following is a summary of the Company s stock option activity under its 2015 and 2005 Plans:
908259_17_ITEM15_P46_S0	As of December 31, 2016 there was approximately $1.3 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards that is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of approximately 2.6 years.
908259_17_ITEM15_P46_S1	The weighted average fair value of stock options issued in 2016 and 2015 was $0.51 and $1.05, respectively.
908259_17_ITEM15_P46_S2	The fair values for the stock options granted were estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:
908259_17_ITEM15_P47_S0	In calculating the estimated fair value of its stock options, the Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires the consideration of the following variables for purposes of estimating fair value:
908259_17_ITEM15_P48_S0	the risk-free interest rate for the expected option term.
908259_17_ITEM15_P49_S0	The closing market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
908259_17_ITEM15_P50_S0	The expected term of options represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding, and is calculated based on the average of the vesting period and the option term.
908259_17_ITEM15_P50_S1	The expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Company s stock price is expected to fluctuate during the term of the option granted.
908259_17_ITEM15_P50_S2	The Company determines the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of its common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term.
908259_17_ITEM15_P50_S3	Expected Dividends Because the Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on any of its common stock and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future, the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option.
908259_17_ITEM15_P51_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury issues with a remaining life consistent with the option s expected term on the date of grant.
908259_17_ITEM15_P51_S1	The Company estimates the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and records compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
908259_17_ITEM15_P52_S0	Basic and diluted net loss per share was calculated by dividing the net loss per share attributed to the Company s common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
908259_17_ITEM15_P52_S1	Diluted net loss per share includes the effect of all dilutive, potentially issuable common equivalent shares as defined using the treasury stock method.
908259_17_ITEM15_P52_S2	All of the Company s common stock equivalents are anti-dilutive due to the Company s net loss position for all periods presented.
908259_17_ITEM15_P52_S3	Accordingly, common stock equivalents of approximately 4,177,000 stock options and 9,842,000 warrants at December 31, 2016 and 2,031,000 stock options and 9,842,000 warrants at December 31, 2015, were excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares for diluted net loss per share.

908259_17_ITEM15_P53_S1	After consideration of the available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company has determined that a full valuation allowance at December 31, 2016 and 2015 is necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.
908259_17_ITEM15_P53_S2	The valuation allowance increased by approximately $4,757,000 and $4,300,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

908259_17_ITEM15_P57_S1	Tax years still subject to examination for Federal and the State authorities include all prior years due to the existence of net operating loss carry-forwards.

908259_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	Overview We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing small molecule injectable drugs for the treatment of cancer.
908259_18_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our goal is to advance our product candidates into late stage pivotal clinical trials and either sell marketing rights to a larger pharmaceutical company or seek FDA approval ourselves.
908259_18_ITEM1_P0_S2	We have two primary programs we are seeking to advance:
908259_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	Using OXi4503 as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia Both of these programs have potential to generate additional new data before the end of 2018.
908259_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	CA4P as an Immuno-oncology Agent Over the last several years, there have been significant advances in cancer immunotherapy, which makes use of the immune system to treat cancer.
908259_18_ITEM1_P2_S1	Immuno-oncology agents stimulate the body s immune system to fight cancer cells, resulting in tumor cell death and tumor regressions in patients who otherwise would not have responded to therapy.
908259_18_ITEM1_P2_S2	Despite these advances, current FDA-approved immuno-oncology agents have significant limitations when used alone to treat cancer, since relatively few patients achieve a durable clinical response following treatment.
908259_18_ITEM1_P2_S3	CA4P has the potential to increase the efficacy of these immuno-oncology agents it has been shown in animal models of several different tumors to improve immune responses that lead to tumor cell death, resulting in increased tumor regressions compared to immune-oncology agents alone.
908259_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	CA4P causes rapid and widespread tumor cell necrosis.
908259_18_ITEM1_P3_S1	This tumor-specific necrosis stimulates the immune system against the tumor.
908259_18_ITEM1_P3_S2	Animal models also show that CA4P significantly enhances the presence and activity of cancer-fighting T-cells within tumors, resulting in increased tumor cell death and tumor regressions.
908259_18_ITEM1_P3_S3	Given these data, we believe CA4P may result in more and/or better clinical responses in certain cancers when combined with immuno-oncology agents, including in patients who either have not experienced a response to therapy, or in patients who have initially responded but subsequently progressed after treatment with immuno-oncology agents alone.
908259_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	The next step in the process of establishing CA4P as a safe and effective immuno-oncology agent will be to initiate a clinical study in a disease in which immuno-oncology agents are used as standard therapy.
908259_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	This clinical study will evaluate CA4P in combination with currently approved immuno-oncology agents in patients with advanced cancer who have previously failed treatment.
908259_18_ITEM1_P4_S2	We believe that the existing human safety database for CA4P, which includes over 500 patients, will help expedite the development timeline for advanced cancer.
908259_18_ITEM1_P4_S3	Our initial immuno-oncology preclinical studies were completed in 2016.
908259_18_ITEM1_P4_S4	One of these studies combined CA4P with an anti-CTLA4 antibody, an approved and well-known immuno-oncology agent, in an EMT-6 mammary tumor model.
908259_18_ITEM1_P4_S5	This study showed that 7 out of 8 mice receiving a combination of CA4P and an anti-CTLA4 antibody experienced complete remission of their tumors, compared to only 1 of 8 in the CA4P monotherapy arm and 2 of 8 in the anti-CTLA4 antibody monotherapy arm.
908259_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	Three of four follow-up preclinical studies confirmed that CA4P combined with immuno-oncology agents could delay tumor growth.
908259_18_ITEM1_P5_S1	These follow-up studies were conducted in a CT26 colon cancer model, a larger tumor EMT-6 mammary cancer model, and a C3H mammary cancer model.
908259_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	model using CA4P combined with anti-CTLA4 antibodies demonstrated a 77% reduction in tumor size compared to immuno- oncology agents alone, and an 89% reduction in tumor size compared to control.
908259_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	This large tumor model also showed a survival benefit for the animals receiving combination therapy, with all animals in the combination surviving at the end of the study, compared to none on control and only half the animals receiving immuno-oncology agents alone.
908259_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	Initial data in an MC38 colon cancer model showed that when CA4P is combined with an anti-PD1 antibody there was a 53% reduction in tumor volume at the end of the study, compared with a 16% reduction for CA4P alone and a 15% reduction for the anti-PD1 antibody alone.
908259_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	Additional analyses of changes induced within tumors following combination therapy have shown that CA4P increases tumor-fighting white blood cell counts, T-cells and cytotoxic T-cells compared to immuno-oncology agents alone.
908259_18_ITEM1_P7_S2	Tumor necrosis with the combination of CA4P and immuno-oncology agents is nearly double the necrosis with only immuno-oncology agents (63.9% compared to 32.8%, control = 25.8%).
908259_18_ITEM1_P7_S3	The overall data from all these studies provides evidence that CA4P may enhance the activity of immuno-oncology agents for the treatment of cancer, including anti-CTLA4 antibodies and anti PD-1 antibodies.
908259_18_ITEM1_P7_S4	We believe CA4P offers the following potential benefits when used in combination with immuno-oncology agents:
908259_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	A promising approach for enhancing the efficacy of immuno-oncology agents: CA4P induces rapid tumor cell death and stimulation of the immune system.
908259_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	It does this by blocking tumor blood flow after binding to and altering the shape of cells lining the tumor blood vessels, resulting in increased tumor cell death and tumor regressions.
908259_18_ITEM1_P8_S2	This is a promising approach for boosting the efficacy of immuno-oncology agents.
908259_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	Potential to be used in many different cancers: Because CA4P works by obstructing tumor blood flow, it has the potential to be used in any tumor type where there is a large number of blood vessels upon which the growth of the tumor cells depends.
908259_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	A large clinical safety database supports its use in clinical trials: Over 500 patients have been treated with CA4P to date in clinical trials.
908259_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	These trials have shown CA4P to be generally well-tolerated, supporting the overall safety of CA4P and the initiation of additional clinical trials in new areas, including in immuno-oncology.
908259_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	OXi4503 for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, is a cancer of the myeloid blood cells, with approximately 21,000 new cases each year in the U.S. and approximately 10,500 deaths.
908259_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	AML is characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that pollute bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells.
908259_18_ITEM1_P11_S2	OXi4503 has been granted orphan drug designation in both the U.S. and the European Union for the treatment of AML, and has received Fast Track designation from the FDA for the treatment of AML.
908259_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	Patients with relapsed/refractory AML are most commonly treated with chemotherapy, and generally have a poor prognosis, with a one-year survival of only 29% after their first relapse.
908259_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	Over the past 20 years, no new therapies have consistently improved patient outcomes in this indication when compared to chemotherapy.
908259_18_ITEM1_P12_S2	Our most clinically advanced compound, OXi4503, is in development as a potential new treatment for relapsed/refractory AML.
908259_18_ITEM1_P12_S3	We have initiated Study OX1222, a clinical trial using escalating doses of OXi4503 in combination with cytarabine to treat relapsed/ refractory AML.
908259_18_ITEM1_P12_S4	In the most recently completed dose cohort of OX1222, the fifth dose tested in the study, two of four patients experienced complete remissions of their disease after just one cycle of treatment with 9.76 mg/m2 of OXi4503.
908259_18_ITEM1_P12_S5	In earlier, lower dose cohorts, there were three patients with complete remissions, which occurred following two cycles of treatment, and two additional patients with meaningful AML blast count reductions.
908259_18_ITEM1_P12_S6	With the lower doses of OXi4503 tested in OX1222, AML blast count reductions were generally observed after the first cycle of treatment, and the complete remissions were observed after two cycles of treatment.
908259_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	highest dose of OXi4503 tested to date, coupled with other partial response data, is a sign of a dose response.
908259_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	The next patients evaluated will be given 12.2 mg/m2 of OXi4503, a 25% increase compared to the most recently completed fifth cohort of the study.
908259_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	OXi4503 has been demonstrated in preclinical studies to work in AML by disrupting tumor blood vessels in the bone marrow, forcing otherwise-dormant leukemic stem cells, which are attached to these tumor blood vessels, into circulation in the blood stream as well as into the active cell cycle, where they become vulnerable to chemotherapy.
908259_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	OXi4503 has also been demonstrated to be cytotoxic itself and kill leukemic cells directly after it has been metabolized by enzymes located within leukemic cells.
908259_18_ITEM1_P14_S2	In preclinical studies, OXi4503 has been shown to enhance the efficacy of cytarabine, idarubucin, azacitidine, and decitabine, which are each commonly-used chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of many cancers, including AML.
908259_18_ITEM1_P14_S3	In early clinical studies, OXi4503 has shown complete responses in high risk patients both as a monotherapy and in combination with cytarabine.
908259_18_ITEM1_P14_S4	We believe OXi4503 offers the following potential benefits:
908259_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	A unique approach for AML: We believe that disrupting bone marrow tumor vessels for the treatment of AML is a new approach for a difficult to treat disease, with few competing clinical programs.
908259_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	A safer alternative to high dose chemotherapy: Many patients, especially those that are older, such as those over age 60, cannot tolerate high dose chemotherapy used in the treatment of AML.
908259_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	These patients generally resort to more tolerable but less efficacious therapies.
908259_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Potential to be used with many therapies: Current AML treatment is highly variable, and many patients receive multiple classes of drugs during the course of their disease.
908259_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	We believe that OXi4503 has the potential to enhance the effect of many common AML therapies.
908259_18_ITEM1_P17_S2	Our Strategy and Development Plan Our primary objective is to advance our investigational drugs for multiple orphan oncology indications.
908259_18_ITEM1_P17_S3	We are currently focused on two core programs CA4P as an immuno-oncology agent and OXi4503 for the treatment of AML.
908259_18_ITEM1_P17_S4	In our AML program, our aim is to obtain clinical data with a dose of OXi4503 higher than the five doses tested to date.
908259_18_ITEM1_P17_S5	In our immuno-oncology program, our aim is to obtain our first clinical data of CA4P in combination with immuno-oncology agents.
908259_18_ITEM1_P17_S6	The key elements of our strategy currently include:
908259_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	Continue to test OXi4503 in the dose-escalating study OX1222, and obtain data for the next scheduled cohort of the study: We have completed five ascending dose cohorts of OXi4503 in combination with cytarabine in Study OX1222 in patients with relapsed/refractory AML.
908259_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	Among the first four cohorts, we observed three complete remissions after two cycles of treatment (18%) with low doses of OXi4503 (3.75 to 7.81 mg/m2).
908259_18_ITEM1_P18_S2	In the fifth cohort, we observed two complete remissions after one cycle of treatment (50%) with a higher dose of OXi4503 (9.76 mg/m2), and have not observed dose-limiting toxicities or reached the maximum tolerable dose (MTD).
908259_18_ITEM1_P18_S3	The protocol for OX1222 provides for giving patients additional higher doses of OXi4503 until an MTD is achieved.
908259_18_ITEM1_P18_S4	However, we have not enrolled patients beyond the fifth cohort due to our limited cash resources.
908259_18_ITEM1_P18_S5	Subject to securing sufficient funding to continue our operations, we plan to enroll patients into a sixth cohort (12.2 mg/m2) of this trial in order to obtain additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of OXi4503.
908259_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	we have seen signs of efficacy, we are planning to expand the sixth and future cohorts to approximately 10 patients per cohort in order to better assess the potential efficacy of OXi4503.
908259_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	Initiate clinical trial of CA4P in combination with an immuno-oncology agent:
908259_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	Based on preclinical data generated to date and support of two well-known immuno-oncology clinical investigators, we intend to initiate the first human clinical trial combining CA4P and an approved immuno-oncology agent in order to make initial determinations of whether the combination results in improved patient outcomes.
908259_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	Continue to discuss CA4P and OXi4503 collaboration opportunities with larger pharmaceutical companies: We intend to find a partner to acquire the marketing rights to our product candidates and to finance further clinical studies.
908259_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	We have been in discussions with larger pharmaceutical companies and plan to continue these discussions for both our core programs, as well as other programs, and will seek to complete a transaction once we reach mutual agreement on terms.
908259_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	Investigator Sponsored Study in Neuroendocrine Tumors Approximately 14,000 patients in the U.S. are diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumors, or NETs, each year.
908259_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	Since patients with NETs can have prolonged survival rates of over 5 years, it is estimated that the overall prevalence is much higher, approximating 100,000 patients in the U.S.
908259_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	These tumors can produce increased amounts of vasoactive substances including hormones, many of which are biologically active and can result in debilitating symptoms including flushing, diarrhea, weight loss and, less frequently, bronchoconstriction and heart failure.
908259_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	It is our belief, based on the available preclinical data, that by reducing blood flow to these tumors using CA4P, we may be able to reduce the production of tumor-derived substances, including the biologically active hormones.
908259_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	We have completed a phase 2 monotherapy clinical trial of CA4P in 18 patients with gastrointestinal or pancreatic NETs and elevated biomarkers.
908259_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	One patient (6%) experienced significant symptomatic improvement as measured by ECOG Status and had a partial response per investigator-assessed RECIST criteria, and an additional 7 patients (39%) had stable disease.
908259_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	In addition, a majority of patients (53%) experienced an improvement in patient-reported quality of life.
908259_18_ITEM1_P24_S3	A statistically significant mean change in biomarkers from baseline, the primary endpoint of the study, was not achieved due to the small sample size along with a high intra- and inter-patient variability observed in the biomarkers.
908259_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	A total of 7 patients were enrolled in a follow-up trial, of which 5 patients (71%) had stable disease, including one that continued for 14 months.
908259_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	The partial response and stable disease analyses, as well as other measures from the trial, suggest that CA4P monotherapy has activity in this indication.
908259_18_ITEM1_P25_S2	Based on the evidence of efficacy observed in this trial, plus an understanding of the benefits of vascular-targeted combination therapy, a lead investigator in this trial is sponsoring and funding a 20 patient study in NETs using CA4P in combination with everolimus (AFINITOR , marketed by Novartis), an anti-angiogenic agent which is already approved and commonly used in this indication.
908259_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	CA4P has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors in both the U.S. and the European Union.
908259_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	We are interested in exploring recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM, as an additional indication for CA4P because:
908259_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	rapid enrollment would be expected in clinical trials for this indication.
908259_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	CA4P has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of glioma in the United States.
908259_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	If funds become available for us to initiate and complete a clinical trial in GBM, we expect that we would pursue a trial.
908259_18_ITEM1_P28_S2	However, we currently do not plan to initiate a GBM clinical trial in the near term in order to conserve current resources.
908259_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	According to Cancer Research UK, a non-profit cancer research organization in the United Kingdom, nearly 90% of all cancers are dependent upon a continually evolving vascular supply for their growth and survival.
908259_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	Vascular-targeted therapies, such as CA4P and OXi4503, are designed to interfere with a tumor s vascular supply.
908259_18_ITEM1_P29_S2	As illustrated in the table below, there are differences between our vascular targeted therapies and anti-angiogenic drugs which act via a different mechanisms to produce complementary biological and anti-vascular effects.
908259_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	Chronic hypertension with long-term use; Acute-impairment in wound healing; Hemorrhage, hemoptysis, gastrointestinal perforation, proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, thromboembolic events, etc.
908259_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	Transient acute blood pressure increases; Tumor pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue; Effects on hematopoiesis and white blood cell counts; In AML similar to solid tumors with more pronounced effects on coagulation and hematopoiesis We believe our drug candidates act on tumor blood vessels via two complementary mechanisms, tubulin depolymerization and disengagement of the junctional protein VE-cadherin, which cause a change in the shape of tumor vascular endothelial cells, tumor vessel occlusion, and the subsequent blockage of blood-flow to the tumor, which deprives the tumor of oxygen and nutrients essential for survival.
908259_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	In vitro studies have demonstrated that our drug candidates act in a reversible fashion on tubulin inside newly-formed and growing endothelial cells, such as the vascular endothelial cells comprising tumor vasculature.
908259_18_ITEM1_P31_S2	By binding to the tubulin, our candidates are able to alter the structural framework that normally maintains the cells flat shape.
908259_18_ITEM1_P31_S3	When this occurs, the shape of the cells changes from flat to round, resulting in physical blockage of the blood vessels.
908259_18_ITEM1_P31_S4	The resulting shutdown in blood-flow then deprives tumor cells of the oxygen and nutrients necessary for maintenance and growth and also prevents tumor cells from being able to excrete toxic metabolic waste products.
908259_18_ITEM1_P31_S5	The consequence of the tumor blood vessel blockage is extensive necrosis (cell death) within the tumor.
908259_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	Preclinical research, published in the November 2005 issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation, showed that our drug candidates also disrupt the molecular engagement of VE-cadherin, a junctional protein important for endothelial cell survival and function.
908259_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	The authors of the research article conclude that this effect only occurs in endothelial cells which lack contact with smooth muscle cells, a known feature of abnormal vasculature associated with tumors and other disease processes.
908259_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	The disengagement of VE-cadherin leads to endothelial cell detachment, which in turn, can cause permanent physical blockage of vessels.
908259_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	Clinical study results and additional preclinical studies indicate that our investigational drugs exert their anti-vascular effects rapidly, within hours of administration, and the half-life of the active form of our drugs in humans is approximately two-four hours.
908259_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	In part because the half-life is relatively short, the effects on tubulin are reversible.
908259_18_ITEM1_P34_S2	However, the pharmacodynamic effect lasts for weeks, so our agents are typically administered no more frequently than once per week.
908259_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	The side-effects are typically transient in nature, limited to the few hours following administration when the active form is in the body in significant concentrations.
908259_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	Side-effects associated with our investigational drugs are generally transient and manageable.
908259_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	vomiting, headache and fatigue, and tumor pain, which is consistent with the drug s mechanism-of-action.
908259_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	The acute blood pressure increases are often manageable by controlling underlying hypertension or treating with short-acting anti-hypertensives prior to infusion.
908259_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	The incidence of serious cardiovascular side-effects such as angina and myocardial ischemia observed across all studies to date (including early studies in which hypertension management and prevention was not employed) was less than 3%, a frequency comparable to that reported with approved anti-angiogenic agents such as bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib.
908259_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	Collaborative Research and Development Arrangements We have entered into a technology license from Arizona State University, or ASU, for rights to combretastatins, which includes CA4P and OXi4503.
908259_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	The ASU license is an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license for the commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights to particular combretastatins.
908259_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	Combretastatins were originally isolated from the bark of the South African Bush Willow tree by researchers from Arizona State University but are now created by synthetic means and have tubulin-dependent anti-vascular and anti-proliferative properties.
908259_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	Under the ASU license, we have the right to grant sublicenses.
908259_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	ASU is entitled to single-digit royalty payments under the license agreement during the term of the patents licensed from ASU.
908259_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	We bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the ASU license.
908259_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	Under the license agreement, we have agreed to diligently proceed with the development, manufacture and sale of products using the licensed technology.
908259_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	ASU has the first responsibility of enforcing patents under the license agreement.
908259_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	License payments made to ASU to date have amounted to $2,700,000, with no further license payments due on the combretastatins we are developing.
908259_18_ITEM1_P42_S2	The agreement remains in force until the expiration of the last to expire patent subject to the ASU license.
908259_18_ITEM1_P42_S3	Either party may terminate the ASU license agreement upon material default or bankruptcy of the other party.
908259_18_ITEM1_P42_S4	In addition, we may terminate the agreement if we determine that filing for regulatory approval is not warranted or economically feasible or upon two months written notice.
908259_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	We also have an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, for commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including among others, CA4P. Under the BMS license, we have the right to grant sublicenses, and BMS is entitled to low single-digit royalty payments for all commercial sales plus any remuneration we receive for sale of CA4P under named patient or compassionate use programs.
908259_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	All licensing fees and milestone payments under the BMS license, in the aggregate amount of $1,080,000, have been paid.
908259_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	We bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the BMS license and have a right, but not a duty, of enforcing patents covered by the license.
908259_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	Either party may terminate the BMS license upon material default of the other party.
908259_18_ITEM1_P44_S2	The term of the BMS license ends upon the expiration of the licensed patents.
908259_18_ITEM1_P44_S3	The latest United States patent licensed under the BMS license is scheduled to expire in December 2021, excluding a patent term extension available under the Hatch-Waxman Act.
908259_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	We were originally incorporated in 1988 in New York as OXiGENE, Inc., reincorporating in Delaware in 1992.
908259_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	In 2016, we changed our name to Mateon Therapeutics, Inc.

908259_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	REGULATORY MATTERS Government Regulation and Product Approval Government authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing.
908259_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	Our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application, or NDA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States.
908259_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations.
908259_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
908259_18_ITEM1_P48_S2	Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions.
908259_18_ITEM1_P48_S3	These sanctions could include the FDA s refusal to review or approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusal of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties.
908259_18_ITEM1_P48_S4	Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
908259_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
908259_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA.
908259_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
908259_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage.
908259_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies.
908259_18_ITEM1_P51_S2	An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND.
908259_18_ITEM1_P51_S3	The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation.
908259_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	Preclinical testing continues even after the IND is submitted.
908259_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	The IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold.
908259_18_ITEM1_P52_S2	In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.
908259_18_ITEM1_P52_S3	Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
908259_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations.
908259_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
908259_18_ITEM1_P53_S2	Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution.
908259_18_ITEM1_P53_S3	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
908259_18_ITEM1_P53_S4	The IRB also approves the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
908259_18_ITEM1_P53_S5	Each new clinical protocol must be submitted to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval.
908259_18_ITEM1_P53_S6	Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and efficacy in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.
908259_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
908259_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
908259_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	Phase 2: Involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate preliminary efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
908259_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population.
908259_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling.
908259_18_ITEM1_P57_S2	Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA.
908259_18_ITEM1_P57_S3	IND Safety Reports must be submitted to the FDA, IRBs and the investigators for (a) any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected; (b) any findings from epidemiological studies, pooled analysis of multiple trials, or clinical trials (other than those already reported in (a)); (c) any findings from animal or in vitro testing, whether or not conducted by the sponsor, that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug, such as reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure; and (d) any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
908259_18_ITEM1_P57_S4	Phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
908259_18_ITEM1_P57_S5	The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
908259_18_ITEM1_P57_S6	Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
908259_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
908259_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug.
908259_18_ITEM1_P58_S2	Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
908259_18_ITEM1_P58_S3	The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product.
908259_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances, which may include orphan drug status and the first NDA application for a company.
908259_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective.
908259_18_ITEM1_P59_S2	The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
908259_18_ITEM1_P59_S3	Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
908259_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing.
908259_18_ITEM1_P60_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing.
908259_18_ITEM1_P60_S2	In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information.
908259_18_ITEM1_P60_S3	The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
908259_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
908259_18_ITEM1_P61_S1	The FDA also may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
908259_18_ITEM1_P61_S2	The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
908259_18_ITEM1_P61_S3	The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA at its discretion or the FDA may require additional clinical or other data and information.
908259_18_ITEM1_P61_S4	Even if such additional data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy its criteria for approval.
908259_18_ITEM1_P61_S5	Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or others may interpret the same data.
908259_18_ITEM1_P61_S6	The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to obtain approval of the NDA.
908259_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product s identity, strength, quality and purity.
908259_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	Before approving an NDA, the FDA will generally inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.
908259_18_ITEM1_P63_S1	The FDA will also generally inspect selected clinical sites that participated in the clinical studies and may inspect the testing facilities that performed the GLP toxicology studies cited in the NDA.
908259_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	NDAs receive either standard or priority review.
908259_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review.
908259_18_ITEM1_P64_S2	In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
908259_18_ITEM1_P64_S3	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials.
908259_18_ITEM1_P64_S4	Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process.
908259_18_ITEM1_P64_S5	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases or patient subpopulations and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
908259_18_ITEM1_P64_S6	In addition, approval by the FDA may include a requirement for phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug s safety and effectiveness, and the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized.
908259_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
908259_18_ITEM1_P65_S1	Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
908259_18_ITEM1_P65_S2	If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in very limited circumstances.
908259_18_ITEM1_P65_S3	In the European Union and Japan, orphan drug exclusivity regulations provide for 10 years of market exclusivity.
908259_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	CA4P has been awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of anaplastic, medullary, Stage IV papillary and Stage IV follicular thyroid cancers, ovarian cancer, neuroendocrine tumors and glioma.
908259_18_ITEM1_P66_S1	OXi4503 has been awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia.
908259_18_ITEM1_P66_S2	CA4P has also been awarded orphan drug status by the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer, ovarian cancer and neuroendocrine tumors.
908259_18_ITEM1_P66_S3	OXi4503 has been awarded orphan drug status by the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia.
908259_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	Expedited Review and Approval The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints.
908259_18_ITEM1_P67_S1	Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may subsequently decide the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the FDA may not shorten the review or approval time period.
908259_18_ITEM1_P67_S2	Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments.
908259_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied.
908259_18_ITEM1_P68_S1	Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review.
908259_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	Drugs that receive an accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
908259_18_ITEM1_P69_S1	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials.
908259_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	OXi4503 has been awarded Fast Track designation for the treatment of AML.
908259_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and if any of our product candidates are approved we will be subject to additional regulations regarding commercial sales and distribution.
908259_18_ITEM1_P71_S1	Whether or not we obtain FDA approval to test a product candidate in the United States, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence testing any product candidate in those countries.
908259_18_ITEM1_P71_S2	Likewise, whether or not we obtain FDA approval to market a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence marketing of any product candidate in those countries.
908259_18_ITEM1_P71_S3	The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
908259_18_ITEM1_P71_S4	The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
908259_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAAs, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.
908259_18_ITEM1_P72_S1	The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders or diabetes and optional for those medicines which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states.
908259_18_ITEM1_P72_S2	The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions.
908259_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states.
908259_18_ITEM1_P73_S1	Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval.
908259_18_ITEM1_P73_S2	If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
908259_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	As in the United States, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, may grant orphan drug status for specific indications if the request is made before an MAA is submitted.
908259_18_ITEM1_P74_S1	The EMA considers an orphan medicinal product to be one that affects less than five of every 10,000 people in the European Union.
908259_18_ITEM1_P74_S2	A company whose application for orphan drug designation in the European Union is approved is eligible to receive, among other benefits, regulatory assistance in preparing the marketing application, protocol assistance and reduced application fees.
908259_18_ITEM1_P74_S3	Orphan drugs in the European Union receive up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication.
908259_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	Reimbursement Sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations.
908259_18_ITEM1_P75_S1	These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for health care products and services.
908259_18_ITEM1_P76_S0	The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products.
908259_18_ITEM1_P76_S1	Adoption or application of price controls and cost-containment measures could limit our revenue.
908259_18_ITEM1_P76_S2	If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective they may not pay for our products even if we receive approval, or their level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
908259_18_ITEM1_P77_S0	The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposes requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries.
908259_18_ITEM1_P77_S1	Under Part D (the Medicare prescription drug benefit), Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs not covered under Medicare Part B. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs.
908259_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	Each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level.
908259_18_ITEM1_P78_S1	Federal regulations require Part D prescription drug formularies to include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, although not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class.
908259_18_ITEM1_P79_S0	In general, government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval.
908259_18_ITEM1_P79_S1	However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.
908259_18_ITEM1_P79_S2	Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.
908259_18_ITEM1_P79_S3	Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA or other Medicare regulations may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
908259_18_ITEM1_P80_S0	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Affordable Care Act or ACA,) mandated prescription drug coverage as one of ten essential health benefits that most health plans must offer, requiring coverage of at least one drug in every category and class.
908259_18_ITEM1_P81_S0	A number of federal government leaders have expressed their intentions to repeal and replace the ACA.
908259_18_ITEM1_P81_S1	If full or partial repeal is enacted, many if not all of the provisions of the ACA may no longer apply to prescription drugs.
908259_18_ITEM1_P81_S2	As a result, we expect that there will continue to be uncertainty regarding drug product pricing, reimbursement and other factors impacting the revenue we may receive if our product candidates are ultimately approved, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_18_ITEM1_P81_S3	In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed.
908259_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.
908259_18_ITEM1_P82_S1	For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.
908259_18_ITEM1_P82_S2	A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.
908259_18_ITEM1_P82_S3	There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
908259_18_ITEM1_P83_S0	Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and tend to be significantly lower.
908259_18_ITEM1_P84_S0	We actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including chemical species, compositions and forms, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, as well as modified forms of naturally-expressed receptors, in the United States and other jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets.
908259_18_ITEM1_P84_S1	We also rely upon trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information.
908259_18_ITEM1_P84_S2	As of March 30, 2018, we were the exclusive licensee, sole assignee or co-assignee of eighteen granted U.S. patents, three pending U.S. provisional patent applications, and granted patents and/or pending applications in several other major markets, including the European Union, Canada and Japan.
908259_18_ITEM1_P84_S3	Our policy is to file U.S. and foreign patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business.
908259_18_ITEM1_P84_S4	There can be no assurance that any of these patent applications will result in the grant of a patent either in the United States or elsewhere, or that any patents granted will be valid and enforceable, or will provide a competitive advantage or will afford protection against competitors with similar technologies.
908259_18_ITEM1_P84_S5	We also intend to rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel drugs.
908259_18_ITEM1_P84_S6	We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements.
908259_18_ITEM1_P84_S7	We consider the following U.S. patents and applications owned by or exclusively licensed to us to be particularly important to the protection of our most advanced product candidates.
908259_18_ITEM1_P85_S0	In-licensed from Arizona State University In addition to these patents, for some of our product candidates, we have patents and/or applications that cover a particular form or composition, use for a particular indication, use as part of combination therapy or method of preparation or use, as well as other pending patent applications.
908259_18_ITEM1_P85_S1	These issued patents, including any patents that issue from pending applications, could provide additional or a longer period of protection.
908259_18_ITEM1_P85_S2	We also have patent applications pending that seek equivalent or substantially comparable protection for our product candidates in jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets.
908259_18_ITEM1_P86_S0	The patent expiration dates referenced above do not reflect any potential patent term extension that we may receive under the federal Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
908259_18_ITEM1_P86_S1	The Hatch-Waxman Act generally permits a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
908259_18_ITEM1_P86_S2	Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years.
908259_18_ITEM1_P87_S0	The patent term restoration period is generally one-half of the time between the effective date of an investigational new drug application, or IND, and the submission date of a new drug application, or NDA, plus the time between the submission date and approval date of an NDA.
908259_18_ITEM1_P87_S1	Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent.
908259_18_ITEM1_P88_S0	The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for patent term extension.
908259_18_ITEM1_P89_S0	As previously noted, the FDA and European Union have granted CA4P and OXi4503 orphan drug status for certain indications.
908259_18_ITEM1_P89_S1	We are also pursuing, and may continue to in the future to pursue, orphan drug status for other product candidates and indications.
908259_18_ITEM1_P89_S2	Our ability to obtain and maintain the exclusivity for our products and product candidates by virtue of their orphan drug status is an important part of our intellectual property strategy.
908259_18_ITEM1_P90_S0	COMPETITION The industry in which we are engaged is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition.
908259_18_ITEM1_P90_S1	Our competitors include, among others, major pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, nearly all of which have financial, technical and marketing resources significantly greater than ours.
908259_18_ITEM1_P90_S2	In addition, many of the small companies in our industry have also formed collaborative relationships with large, established companies to support research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours.
908259_18_ITEM1_P90_S3	Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and patenting new technologies in our line of business and any of these entities may commercialize products that may be competitive with ours.
908259_18_ITEM1_P90_S4	We expect that, if any of our products gain regulatory approval for sale, they will compete primarily on the basis of product efficacy, safety, patient convenience, reliability, price and patent protection.
908259_18_ITEM1_P90_S5	Our competitive position will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop effective proprietary products and implement joint ventures or other alliances with large pharmaceutical companies in order to jointly market and manufacture our products.
908259_18_ITEM1_P90_S6	At December 31, 2017 we had five full-time employees.
908259_18_ITEM1_P90_S7	As of March 30, 2018, we had two full-time employees.
908259_18_ITEM1_P90_S8	We expect to continue to maintain a relatively small number of executives and other employees.
908259_18_ITEM1_P90_S9	We rely on outsourcing for much of our research, development, preclinical testing and clinical trial activity, although we maintain managerial and quality control over our clinical trials.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Business and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as oral statements that may be made by us or by officers, directors or employees acting on our behalf, that are not historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from the historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors set forth below.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	If we are unable to obtain additional funding, we may be forced to cease operations.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	We have experienced net losses every year since inception and, as of December 31, 2017, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $292 million.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	We have no source of revenue and do not expect to receive any product revenue in the near future.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P1_S4	If we remain in business, we expect to incur additional operating losses over the next several years, principally as a result of our continuing development of our investigational drugs.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P1_S5	As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $1.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and current liabilities of approximately $1.6 million.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Based on our planned operations and $2.4 million in estimated net proceeds from a private placement completed in April 2018, Management expects to be able to support operations only into the fourth quarter of 2018.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Prior to this time, we will need to secure additional funding or we may be forced to terminate or further curtail operations.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P1_S8	Because we do not currently have a guaranteed source of capital that will sustain operations for at least the next twelve months, Management has determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P1_S9	The principal source of our working capital to date has been the proceeds from the sale of equity.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P1_S10	If we are unable to access additional funds in the near term, whether through the sale of additional equity or another means, we may not be able to continue in business.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P1_S11	We also may not be able to continue the development of our investigational drugs.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P1_S12	Any additional equity financing, if available to us, may not be available on favorable terms and would most likely be dilutive to stockholders.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P1_S13	Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and also be dilutive to current stockholders.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	If we obtain funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates on terms that are not favorable to us.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	In their audit report with regard to our financial statements as of December 31, 2017, our independent registered public accountants expressed an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as a going concern.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Because we have limited cash resources, we believe that it will be necessary for us to either raise additional capital before the end of 2018 or to enter into a license or other agreement with a larger pharmaceutical company before the end of 2018.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P2_S4	If we do not succeed in doing so, we may be required to suspend or cease our business, which would likely materially harm the value of our common stock.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P2_S5	We will require additional capital funding, the receipt of which may impair the value of our common stock.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our research, development, sales and marketing activities.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P2_S7	We will need to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt offerings or through arrangements with strategic partners or other sources in order to continue to develop our product candidates.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P2_S8	There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available when needed or on terms satisfactory to us, if at all.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P2_S9	To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our shareholders may experience substantial dilution and the new equity securities may have greater rights, preferences or privileges than our existing common stock.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Due in part to our limited financial resources, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates, and we may be unable to pursue and complete the clinical trials that we would like to pursue and complete.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We have limited financial and technical resources to determine the indications on which we should focus the development efforts for our product candidates.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Due to our limited available financial resources, we have curtailed clinical development programs and activities that might otherwise have led to more rapid progress of our product candidates through the regulatory and development processes.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	We currently have limited financial resources to complete our planned drug development work, which is limited to one additional cohort in our Study OX1222 of OXi4503 for relapsed/refractory AML and initiating a clinical trial of CA4P in combination with an approved immune-oncology agent.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Due to our limited financial resources, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete either of these programs.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P3_S5	We may make incorrect determinations with regard to the indications and clinical trials on which to focus the available resources that we do have.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P3_S7	We currently are required by our financial resources to engage only in limited clinical activities.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P3_S8	The decisions to allocate our research, management and financial resources toward particular indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P3_S9	Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate drug development programs may also cause us to miss valuable opportunities.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P3_S10	In addition, from time to time, we may in-license or otherwise acquire product candidates to supplement our internal development activities.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P3_S11	Those activities may use resources that otherwise would have been devoted to our internal programs, and with research and development programs there is no way to assure that the outcome of any trials or other activities will be positive, whether the program was internally generated or in-licensed.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P3_S12	If we are unable to obtain required regulatory approvals, we will be unable to market and sell our product candidates.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P3_S13	Our product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to development, clinical trials, manufacturing, oversight of clinical investigators, recordkeeping and commercialization.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P3_S14	Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory review and approval process are required to be successfully completed in the United States, in the European Union and in many other foreign jurisdictions before a new drug can be sold.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P3_S15	Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain, and subject to unanticipated delays.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The time required to obtain approval by the FDA or the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is unpredictable and often takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In connection with the clinical development of our product candidates, we face risks that:
908259_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	the results from clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance or clinical benefit-to-risk ratio required by the FDA, EMA or other regulatory agencies for marketing approval.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Only a small percentage of product candidates for which clinical trials are initiated are the subject of NDAs and even fewer receive approval for commercialization.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Furthermore, even if we do receive regulatory approval to market a product candidate, any such approval may be subject to limitations such as those on the indicated uses for which we may market the product.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If we or the third parties on which we rely for the conduct of our clinical trials and results do not perform our clinical trial activities in accordance with good clinical practices and related regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We currently use independent clinical investigators in all of our clinical trials and, in many cases, also utilize contract research organizations, or CROs, and other third-party service providers to conduct and/or oversee the clinical trials of our product candidates and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Nonetheless, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the FDA s requirements and our general investigational plan and protocol.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Currently, we have clinical trial activities involving CA4P and OXi4503 being conducted by clinical investigators who are independent of us, but with whom we have agreements for them to provide the results of their clinical trials to us.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P6_S7	In order for us to rely on data from these ongoing clinical trials in support of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for approval of any of our product candidates by the FDA or similar types of marketing applications that are required by other regulatory authorities, the independent investigators are required to comply with applicable good clinical practice requirements.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P6_S8	The FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities require us and our clinical investigators to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting and recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P6_S9	Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P6_S10	Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or the respective trial plans and protocols.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P6_S11	The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates or result in enforcement action against us.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P6_S12	We have taken and continue to take steps to strengthen our procedures and practices, but we cannot assure you that the FDA will be satisfied with our procedures or that the FDA will not issue warning letters or take other enforcement action against us in the future.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P6_S13	The steps we take to strengthen our procedures and conduct future clinical trials necessary for approval will be time-consuming and expensive.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P6_S14	We may encounter difficulties in expanding our operations successfully if and when we evolve from a company that is primarily involved in clinical development to a company that is also involved in commercialization.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P6_S15	As we advance our product candidates through later stages of clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P6_S16	As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with such third parties, as well as additional collaborators, distributors, marketers and suppliers.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P6_S17	Maintaining third party relationships for these purposes will impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management and other personnel.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P6_S18	We must be able to manage our development efforts effectively, manage our participation in the clinical trials in which our product candidates are involved effectively, and improve our managerial, development, operational and finance systems, all of which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	If, following any approval of our product candidates, we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing or distribution services, any product revenues that we receive, or the profitability of these product revenues to us, are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our products or in doing so on terms that are favorable to us.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our products.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	If we were to submit an NDA for our drug candidates in the United States or a marketing application in the EU, we would need to undertake commercial scale manufacturing activities at significant expense to us in order to proceed with the application for approval for commercialization.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P7_S5	We or our external vendors may encounter technical difficulties that preclude us from successfully manufacturing the required registration and validation batches of active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and/or drug product and we may be unable to recover any financial losses associated with the manufacturing activities.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P7_S6	Further, our research or product development efforts may not be successfully completed, any compounds currently under development by us may not be successfully developed into drugs, any potential products may not receive regulatory approval on a timely basis, if at all, and competitors may develop and bring to market products or technologies that render our potential products obsolete.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P7_S7	If any of these problems occur, our business would be materially and adversely affected.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P7_S8	We have no manufacturing capacity and have relied on, and expect to continue to rely on, third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P7_S9	We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates or any of the compounds that we are testing in our preclinical programs, and we lack the resources and the capabilities to do so.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P7_S10	As a result, we currently rely, and we expect to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party manufacturers to supply our product candidates.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P7_S11	Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our product candidates or products ourselves, including:
908259_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	the possible termination or non-renewal of the manufacturing agreements by the third-party, at a time that is costly or inconvenient to us.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If we do not maintain our developed important manufacturing relationships, we may fail to find replacement manufacturers or develop our own manufacturing capabilities, which could delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products and substantially increase our costs or deplete profit margins, if any.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If we do find replacement manufacturers, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us, and there could be a substantial delay before new facilities could be qualified and registered with the FDA, EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The FDA, EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities require manufacturers to register manufacturing facilities.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The FDA and corresponding foreign regulators also inspect these facilities to confirm compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Contract manufacturers may face manufacturing or quality control problems causing drug substance production and shipment delays or a situation where the contractor may not be able to maintain compliance with the applicable cGMP requirements.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Any failure to comply with cGMP requirements or other FDA, EMA and comparable foreign regulatory requirements could adversely affect our clinical research activities and our ability to develop our product candidates and market our products after approval.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our ability to develop our product candidates, our ability to commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval and our potential future profit margins on these products.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our product candidates have not completed clinical trials, and may never demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in order to do so.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Our product candidates are in the clinical stage of development.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	In order to achieve profitable operations, we alone or in collaboration with others, must successfully develop, manufacture, introduce and market our products.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P10_S4	The time frame necessary to achieve market success for any individual product is long and uncertain.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P10_S5	The products currently under development by us may require significant additional research and development and additional preclinical and clinical testing prior to application for commercial use.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	A number of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after showing promising results in early or later-stage studies or clinical trials.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Although we have obtained some favorable results to date in preclinical studies and clinical trials of certain of our potential products, such results may not be indicative of results that will ultimately be obtained in or throughout such clinical trials, and clinical trials may not show any of our products to be safe or capable of producing a desired result.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Additionally, we may encounter problems in our clinical trials that may cause us to delay, suspend or terminate those clinical trials.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Adverse events observed to date and associated with CA4P and OXi4503 have generally been found to be manageable for drugs treating the indications for which we are developing our product candidates.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P11_S4	However, we will be required to continue to test and evaluate the safety of our product candidates in additional clinical trials, and to demonstrate their safety to the satisfaction of appropriate regulatory agencies, as a condition to receipt of any regulatory approvals.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In clinical trials to date, transient hypertension believed to be associated with CA4P and OXi4503 has been effectively managed through pre-treatment with anti-hypertensive medication.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to make the necessary demonstrations of safety to allow us to receive regulatory approval for our product candidates in any indication.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We only have a limited number of employees to manage and operate our business.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of five full-time employees, and had two employees as of March 30, 2018.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our limited financial resources require us to manage and operate our business in a highly efficient manner.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We have a history of losses, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future; our auditors have included in their audit report an explanatory paragraph as to substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	We have experienced net losses every year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2017, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $292 million.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Our auditors have included in their audit report a going concern explanatory paragraph as to substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern that assumes the realization of our assets and the satisfaction of our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P13_S5	We anticipate continuing to incur substantial additional losses over at least the next several years due to, among other factors, our continuing clinical trials and development activities with respect to our VDA drug candidates, technologies, and anticipated research and development activities and the general and administrative expenses associated with those activities.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P13_S6	We have not yet commercialized any product candidates.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P13_S7	Our ability to attain profitability will depend upon our ability to develop and commercialize products that are effective and commercially viable, to obtain regulatory approval for the manufacture and sale of our products and to license or otherwise market our products successfully.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We depend on our executive officers and principal consultants and the loss of their services could materially harm our business.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We believe that our success depends, and will likely continue to depend, upon our ability to retain the services of our current executive officers, particularly our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our principal consultants and others.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Our executive officers have been working at 50% salaries since early October 2017, which increases the risk that we may not be able to retain their services.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P14_S4	In addition to these key service providers, we have established relationships with universities, hospitals and research institutions, which have historically provided, and continue to provide, us with access to research laboratories, clinical trials, facilities and patients.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Additionally, we believe that we may, at any time and from time to time, materially depend on the services of consultants and other unaffiliated third parties.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P14_S6	We cannot assure you that consultants and other unaffiliated third parties will provide the level of service to us that we require in order to achieve our business objectives.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P14_S7	Our industry is highly competitive, and our product candidates may become obsolete.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P14_S8	We are engaged in a rapidly evolving field.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P14_S9	Competition from other pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and research and academic institutions is intense and likely to increase.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P14_S10	Many of those companies and institutions have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P14_S11	Many of those companies and institutions also have substantially greater experience in developing products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and in manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P14_S12	Our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for competitive products.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Some of these competitive products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing the desired therapeutic effect than products being developed by us.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Our competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective and/or cost competitive than those we are developing, or that would render our product candidates less competitive or even obsolete.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	In addition, one or more of our competitors may achieve product commercialization or patent protection earlier than we do, which could materially adversely affect us.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P15_S4	We depend extensively on the patents and proprietary technology we license from others, and we must maintain these licenses in order to preserve our business.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P15_S5	We have licensed in rights to CA4P, OXi4503 and other programs from third parties.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P15_S6	If our license agreements terminate or expire, we may lose the licensed rights to our product candidates, including CA4P and OXi4503, and we may not be able to continue to develop them or, if they are approved, we may not be able to market or commercialize them.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P15_S7	We depend on license agreements with third-parties for certain intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates, including patent rights.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Currently, we have licensed in certain patent rights from Arizona State University, or ASU, and the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company for CA4P and OXi4503 and from Baylor University for other programs.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P15_S9	In general, our license agreements require us to make payments and satisfy performance obligations in order to keep these agreements in effect and retain our rights under them.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P15_S10	These payment obligations can include upfront fees, maintenance fees, milestones, royalties, patent prosecution expenses, and other fees.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P15_S11	These performance obligations typically include diligence obligations.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P15_S12	If we fail to pay, be diligent or otherwise perform as required under our license agreements, we could lose the rights under the patents and other intellectual property rights covered by the agreements.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P15_S13	While we are not currently aware of any dispute with any licensors under our material agreements with them, if disputes arise under any of our in-licenses, including our in-licenses from ASU, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Baylor University, we could lose our rights under these agreements.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P15_S14	Any such dispute may not be resolvable on favorable terms, or at all.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	other resources could be consumed by the need to attend to and seek to resolve these disputes and our business could be harmed by the emergence of such a dispute.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	If we lose our rights under these agreements, we may not be able to conduct any further activities with the product candidate or program that the license covered.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If this were to happen, we might not be able to develop our product candidates further, or following regulatory approval, if any, we might be prohibited from marketing or commercializing them.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	In particular, patents previously licensed to us, such as the patents we previously licensed from Angiogene, might after termination be used to stop us from conducting activities in the patents respective fields.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	We depend on patents and proprietary technology in the course of our business, and we must protect those assets in order to preserve our business.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Although we expect to seek patent protection for any compounds we discover and/or for any specific use we discover for new or previously known compounds, any or all of them may not be subject to effective patent protection.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Further, the development of regimens for the administration of pharmaceuticals, which generally involve specifications for the frequency, timing and amount of dosages, has been, and we believe, may continue to be, important to our effort, although those processes, as such, may not be patentable.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P16_S7	In addition, the issued patents may be declared invalid or our competitors may find ways to avoid the claims in the patents.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P16_S8	Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, protect our trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We are the exclusive licensee, sole assignee or co-assignee on a number of granted United States patents, pending United States patent applications, and granted patents and/or pending applications in several other major markets, including the European Union, Canada and Japan.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms like us is generally highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions, resulting in both an apparent inconsistency regarding the breadth of claims allowed in United States patents and general uncertainty as to their legal interpretation and enforceability.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Accordingly, patent applications assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not result in patents being issued, any issued patents assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not provide us with competitive protection or may be challenged by others, and the current or future granted patents of others may have an adverse effect on our ability to do business and achieve profitability.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Moreover, because some of the basic research relating to one or more of our patent applications and/or patents were performed at various universities and/or funded by grants, one or more of these universities, employees of such universities and/or grantors could assert that they have certain rights in such research and any resulting products.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Further, others may independently develop similar products, may duplicate our products, or may design around our patent rights.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	In addition, as a result of the assertion of rights by a third-party or otherwise, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of others in or outside of the United States.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Any licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights may not be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P18_S6	If we do not obtain such licenses, we could encounter delays in product market introductions while our attempts to design around such patents or could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is foreclosed.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P18_S7	In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against us or in connection with patents to which we hold licenses or in bringing suit to protect our own patents against infringement.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P18_S8	We require employees and the institutions that perform our preclinical and clinical trials to enter into confidentiality agreements with us.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P18_S9	Those agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to a party to any such agreement during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third-parties, except in specific circumstances.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P18_S10	Any such agreement may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The use of our products may result in product liability exposure, and it is uncertain whether our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all claims.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The use of our product candidates in clinical trials may expose us to liability claims in the event such product candidates cause death, injury or disease, or result in adverse effects.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We may be exposed to liability claims even if our product did not cause death, injury or diseases, but is merely presumed or alleged to have caused any of these.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If our product candidates are ever commercially approved, the commercial use of these products may also expose us to similar liability claims.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Any of these claims could be made by health care institutions, contract laboratories, patients or others using such products.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Although we have obtained liability insurance coverage for our ongoing clinical trials, this coverage may not be in amounts sufficient to protect us from any product liability claims or product recalls which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Further, adverse product and similar liability claims could negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our technology and product candidates under development.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P19_S7	If clinical trials or regulatory approval processes for our product candidates are prolonged, delayed or suspended, we may be unable to out-license or commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis, which would require us to incur additional costs and delay or prevent our receipt of any proceeds from potential license agreements or product sales.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P19_S8	We cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or any regulatory authority to delay or suspend those clinical trials or delay or invalidate the analysis of data derived from them.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P19_S9	A number of events, including any of the following, could delay the completion of our other ongoing and planned clinical trials and negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and to market and sell, a particular product candidate:
908259_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	failure of our third-party contractors to comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise meet their contractual obligations to us.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Commercialization or licensure of our product candidates may be delayed or prevented by the imposition of additional conditions on our clinical trials by the FDA, EMA or another foreign regulatory authority or the requirement of additional supportive clinical trials by the FDA, EMA or another foreign regulatory authority.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, clinical trials require sufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the conduct of other clinical trials that compete for the same patients as our clinical trials, and the eligibility criteria for our clinical trials.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Our failure to enroll patients in our clinical trials could delay the completion of the clinical trial beyond our expectations, or it could prevent us from being able to complete the clinical trial.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In addition, the FDA and EMA could require us to conduct clinical trials with a larger number of subjects than we have projected for any of our product candidates.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P20_S5	We may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in a timely or cost-effective manner.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Furthermore, enrolled patients may drop out of our clinical trials, which could impair the validity or statistical significance of the clinical trials.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We do not know whether our clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured, or will be completed on schedule, if at all.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Delays in our clinical trials will result in increased development costs for our product candidates, and our financial resources may be insufficient to fund any incremental costs.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, if our clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be limited.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We have been granted orphan drug status for certain of our product candidates and may seek orphan drug status for additional indications for those product candidates or for additional product candidates.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P21_S4	We may be unsuccessful in maintaining orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates and may be unsuccessful in our efforts to seek orphan drug status and orphan drug exclusivity.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Our lead product candidate, OXi4503, has been awarded orphan drug status by the FDA and the European Commission for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Our other product candidate, CA4P, has been awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of anaplastic, medullary, Stage IV papillary and Stage IV follicular thyroid cancers, ovarian cancer, neuroendocrine tumors and glioma.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	CA4P has also been awarded orphan drug status by the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer, ovarian cancer and neuroendocrine tumors.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the EMA or the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication during the period of exclusivity.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P22_S6	The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in the European Union.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P22_S7	The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P22_S8	Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or the EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective, if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P22_S9	Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product candidate or additional product candidates, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product candidate from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P22_S10	Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve a different drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P22_S11	Our product candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory review even if they receive marketing approval, and if we fail to comply with continuing regulations, we could lose these approvals and the sale of any approved commercial products could be suspended.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P22_S12	Even if we receive regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, and record keeping related to the product will remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P22_S13	If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA, EMA and other applicable domestic and foreign regulatory authorities or previously unknown problems with any approved product, manufacturer, or manufacturing process are discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:
908259_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If physicians and patients do not accept our future products or if the market for indications for which any product candidate is approved is smaller than expected, we may be unable to generate significant revenue, if any.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Even if any of our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, and third-party payers.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Physicians may decide not to prescribe our drugs for a variety of reasons including:
908259_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	ineffective marketing and distribution support of our products.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If any of our product candidates is approved, but fails to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenue and our business would suffer.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	The uncertainty associated with pharmaceutical reimbursement and related matters may adversely affect our business.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Market acceptance and sales of any one or more of our product candidates that we develop will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will cover and establish payment levels.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We cannot be certain that reimbursement will be available for any product candidates that we develop.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Also, we cannot be certain that reimbursement policies will not reduce the demand for, or the price paid for, our products.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	If reimbursement is not available or is available on a limited basis, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidates that we develop.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The legislation established Medicare Part D, which expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drug purchases by the elderly but provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The United States and several foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any products that we develop due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, ACA, became law in the U.S.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The goal of ACA is to reduce the cost of health care and substantially change the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P29_S2	While we cannot predict what impact on federal reimbursement policies this legislation will have in general or on our business specifically, the ACA may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of, and the price we may charge for, any products we develop that receive regulatory approval.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P29_S3	We also cannot predict the impact of ACA on us as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions, which have not yet been fully implemented.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P29_S4	More recently, the current U.S. presidential administration has made statements suggesting plans to seek repeal of all or portions of the ACA, and the U.S. Congress is considering such repeal or partial repeal and replacement.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P29_S5	There is uncertainty regarding the impact that the President s administration may have on matters currently governed by the ACA, if any, and any regulatory or legislative changes will likely take time to unfold.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P29_S6	These changes could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the ACA.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P29_S7	However, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Our operations and the financial results of our operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Global financial concerns have caused, and may continue to cause, extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P31_S4	A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P31_S5	We cannot currently anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P31_S7	Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our third-party CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P31_S8	Furthermore, we have little or no control over the security measures and computer systems of our third-party CROs and other contractors and consultants.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P31_S9	While we have not experienced any material system failure, accident, or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our programs.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating to our technology or product candidates, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our employees, principal investigators, CROs and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	We are exposed to the risk that our employees, principal investigators, CROs and consultants may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violate the regulations of the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such authorities; healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad; or laws that require the reporting of financial information or data accurately.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P32_S4	In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or creating fraudulent data in our preclinical studies or clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P32_S6	We have a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P32_S7	Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P32_S8	If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P32_S9	We, or the third parties upon whom we depend, may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P32_S10	Earthquakes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P32_S11	If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P32_S12	The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P32_S13	We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P32_S14	The price of our common stock is volatile, and is likely to continue to fluctuate due to reasons beyond our control; a limited public trading market may cause volatility in the price of our common stock.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P32_S15	The market price of our common stock has been, and likely will continue to be, highly volatile.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	market price of our common stock.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We cannot assure you that an investment in our common stock will not fluctuate significantly.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	One or more of these factors could significantly harm our business and cause a decline in the price of our common stock in the public market.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Substantially all of the shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants have been registered or are likely to be registered for resale or are available for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and may be sold from time to time.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	As of April 12, 2018, there was an aggregate of 29,999,751 shares of common stock underlying currently outstanding warrants and options.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Such sales, as well as future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders, or the perception that sales may occur at any time, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQX marketplace.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	The quotation of our common stock on the OTCQX marketplace does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market currently exists, and in recent years such market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many smaller companies like us.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Our common stock is subject to this volatility.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock and our stock price may decline substantially in a short time and our stockholders could suffer losses or be unable to liquidate their holdings.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Our Common Stock is currently subject to the Penny Stock Rules of the SEC and the trading market in our securities is limited, which makes transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our stock.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P36_S5	As of December 31, 2017, we had net tangible assets of $2,000,000 or less and our common stock had a market price per share of less than $5.00.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P36_S6	As a result, transactions in our common stock are subject to the SEC s penny stock rules.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P36_S7	The designation of our common stock as a penny stock likely limits the liquidity of our common stock.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Prices for penny stocks are often not available to buyers and sellers and the market may be very limited.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Penny stocks are among the riskiest equity investments.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks must provide purchasers of these stocks with a standardized risk-disclosure document prepared by the SEC.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	The document provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks involved in investing in the penny stock market.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P38_S3	A broker must also provide purchasers with bid and offer quotations and information regarding broker and salesperson compensation and make a written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and obtain the purchaser s written agreement to the purchase.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Many brokers choose not to participate in penny stock transactions.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Because of the penny stock rules, there may be less trading activity in penny stocks.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Because shares of our common stock are currently subject to these penny stock rules, your ability to trade or dispose of shares of our common stock may be adversely affected.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We may not be able to achieve secondary trading of our stock in certain states because our common stock is no longer nationally traded, which could subject our stockholders to significant restrictions and costs.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Our common stock is not currently eligible for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market or on a national securities exchange.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Therefore, our common stock is subject to the securities laws of the various states and jurisdictions of the United States in addition to federal securities law.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P39_S5	While we may register our common stock or qualify for exemptions for our common stock in one of more states, if we fail to do so the investors in those states where we have not taken such steps may not be allowed to purchase our stock or those who presently hold our stock may not be able to resell their shares without substantial effort and expense.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P39_S6	These restrictions and potential costs could be significant burdens on our stockholders.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and the trading price of our stock.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	For example, during the third quarter of 2013, our management determined that we had a material weakness related to the operation of our controls over financial reporting associated with a complex non-routine financing transaction in the second quarter of 2013.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework).
908259_18_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P42_S3	We continue to work on maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting; however, there can be no assurance that another material weakness will not occur in the future.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Any failure to implement and maintain controls over our financial reporting or difficulties encountered in the implementation of improvements in our controls, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P42_S5	Any failure to maintain our internal controls over financial reporting or to address identified weaknesses in the future, if they were to occur, could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P42_S6	Issuance of additional equity securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P42_S7	We are currently authorized to issue up to 70,000,000 shares of our common stock and 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P42_S8	As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 26,545,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, and no shares of preferred stock outstanding.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P42_S9	As of December 31, 2017, we also had approximately 9,626,000 warrants and 4,880,000 options outstanding.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P42_S10	On April 12, 2018, we issued an additional 14,625,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 14,625,000 shares of common stock in a private placement transaction, and we may issue additional shares in the near future.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P42_S11	We are planning to seek stockholder approval for an increase the number of authorized shares of common stock at our next annual meeting.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P42_S12	To the extent that additional shares of common stock are issued or options and warrants are exercised, holders of our common stock will experience dilution.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P42_S13	In addition, in the event of any future issuances of equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, holders of our common stock may experience dilution.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Our board of directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, conversion rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or if we liquidate, dissolve or wind up our business and other terms.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	If we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decrease.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Any provision permitting the conversion of any such preferred stock into our common stock could result in significant dilution to the holders of our common stock.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P43_S4	We also consider from time to time various strategic alternatives that could involve issuances of additional common stock, including but not limited to acquisitions and business combinations, but do not currently have any definitive plans to enter into any of these transactions.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P43_S5	We have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, and you may not receive funds without selling your common stock.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P43_S6	We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, nor do we expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P43_S7	We currently intend to retain any future earnings, if any, to finance our operations and growth and, potentially, for future stock repurchases and, therefore, we have no plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P43_S8	Any future determination to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, any contractual restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your common stock in order to generate cash from your investment in Mateon Therapeutics, Inc.
908259_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	You may not receive a gain on your investment when you sell our common stock and may lose the entire amount of your investment.

908259_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	The lease for this space, as amended, expires on June 30, 2019.
908259_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	We believe that these facilities will meet our needs for the foreseeable future.

908259_18_ITEM5_P0_S3	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices of our common stock, rounded to the nearest cent, on the OTCQX Market and on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as applicable, as reported by each of the markets, for each quarterly period during the two most recent fiscal years.
908259_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of April 12, 2018, there were approximately 80 stockholders of record of the 41,169,934 outstanding shares of the Company s common stock.
908259_18_ITEM5_P1_S1	Dividends The Company has not declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock since its inception in 1988, and does not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
908259_18_ITEM5_P1_S2	The Company presently intends to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of its business.

908259_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
908259_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or outcomes to be materially different from those anticipated and discussed herein.
908259_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	Important factors that we believe may cause such differences are discussed in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report and in the Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 section of this Annual Report.
908259_18_ITEM7_P0_S3	In assessing forward-looking statements contained herein, readers are urged to read carefully all Risk Factors and cautionary statements contained in this Annual Report.
908259_18_ITEM7_P0_S4	Further, we operate in an industry sector where securities prices are volatile and may be influenced by regulatory and other factors beyond our control.
908259_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing drugs for the treatment of orphan oncology indications, with our most advanced program evaluating our investigational drug OXi4503 in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia, or AML.
908259_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	In this clinical trial we have most recently observed that two of four patients in the fifth dose cohort of an ascending-dose study experienced complete remissions of their disease after just one cycle of treatment with 9.76 mg/m2 of OXi4503.
908259_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	Earlier in the clinical trial, at lower doses of our drug, we observed three patients with complete remissions following two cycles of treatment and two patients with partial remissions.
908259_18_ITEM7_P1_S3	Following fifth dose cohort, we paused enrollment in the study due to our lack of available cash to complete further testing.
908259_18_ITEM7_P1_S4	More recently, following the closing of approximately $2.4 million in net proceeds from a financing transaction, we instructed the clinical sites to begin screening new patients for the sixth dose cohort, and we expect that additional patients will enter the clinical trial within a few months.
908259_18_ITEM7_P1_S5	We are also developing CA4P as an immuno-oncology agent.
908259_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Recent preclinical data has shown treatment with the combination of CA4P and an anti-CTLA-4 antibody nearly doubles the amount of tumor necrosis (mean = 63.9%) compared to treatment with an anti-CTLA-4 antibody alone (32.8%), CA4P alone (37.3%) or vehicle control (25.8%) in a preclinical CT-26 mouse colon cancer model.
908259_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	Results from this most recent analysis preclinically confirmed our earlier findings which showed that treatment with CA4P and an approved immuno-oncology agent resulted in increased overall median numbers of tumor infiltrating white blood cells, T cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes.
908259_18_ITEM7_P2_S2	The data also showed that the distribution of the beneficial CD8+T lymphocyte cells was observed throughout the tumor - in both the tumor rim and tumor core.
908259_18_ITEM7_P2_S3	Based on these data, and the existing clinical safety database of CA4P, we are planning to initiate a clinical trial of CA4P in combination with an immuno-oncology agent in the near future.
908259_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	combination with immuno-oncology agents and 3) conducting a phase 2 clinical trial of CA4P in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
908259_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	On September 26, 2017, due to the lack of a clear efficacy signal in a planned interim analysis of our phase 2 platinum-resistant ovarian cancer study, we terminated the study and announced the termination of future development of CA4P in ovarian cancer.
908259_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	Thereafter, effective October 2, 2017, we terminated the employment of over half of our workforce and reduced the salaries of our executive officers by 50%, with reinstatement to previous compensation levels contingent on a change in control of the Company or the Company raising additional funding of at least $4 million.
908259_18_ITEM7_P3_S3	To date the Company has not achieved the specified level of additional funding to reinstate the salaries.
908259_18_ITEM7_P3_S4	On April 12, 2018, we closed on net proceeds of approximately $2.4 million from a private placement transaction, or the Private Placement.
908259_18_ITEM7_P3_S5	In the Private Placement, we sold 58.5 units at a purchase price of $50,000 per unit.
908259_18_ITEM7_P3_S6	Each unit contained 250,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to 250,000 shares of our common stock.
908259_18_ITEM7_P3_S7	The purchase price of the common stock was $0.20 per share and warrants are exercisable at $0.40 per share.
908259_18_ITEM7_P3_S8	The exercise price of the warrants will only be payable in cash, with no cashless exercise provisions.
908259_18_ITEM7_P3_S9	The Private Placement will currently terminate upon the earlier of the sale of 80 units or April 30, 2018.
908259_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	We plan to register the shares of common stock that were issued and the shares of common stock that are issuable upon exercise of the warrants.
908259_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
908259_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time we make such estimates.
908259_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from our estimates, judgments and assumptions.
908259_18_ITEM7_P5_S3	We periodically review our estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience.
908259_18_ITEM7_P5_S4	The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate.
908259_18_ITEM7_P5_S5	Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
908259_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles.
908259_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	We believe the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments are the following: Research and development expenses Research and development expenses consist of costs we incur for the development of our investigational drugs and, to a lesser extent, for preclinical research activities.
908259_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
908259_18_ITEM7_P6_S3	Research and development expenses include clinical trial costs, salaries and benefits of employees, including associated stock-based compensation, payments to clinical investigators, drug manufacturing costs, laboratory supplies and facility costs.
908259_18_ITEM7_P6_S4	Clinical trial costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses, and these can be difficult to accurately estimate.
908259_18_ITEM7_P6_S5	Included in clinical trial costs are fees paid to other entities that conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf, such as clinical research organizations, or CROs.
908259_18_ITEM7_P6_S6	We estimate clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions such as CROs and the actual clinical investigators.
908259_18_ITEM7_P6_S7	These estimates are based on actual time and expenses incurred by the CRO and the clinical investigators.
908259_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	under the related clinical trial agreement.
908259_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	Changes in clinical trial assumptions, such as the length of time estimated to enroll all patients, rate of screening failures, patient drop-out rates, number and nature of adverse event reports and the total number of patients enrolled can impact the average and expected cost per patient and the overall cost of the clinical trial.
908259_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	Based on patient enrollment reports and services provided, we may periodically adjust estimates for the clinical trial costs.
908259_18_ITEM7_P7_S3	If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed, the length of time for these services or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates.
908259_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Share-based compensation We record the estimated fair value of all share-based payments issued to employees and other service providers.
908259_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	Our share-based payments consist primarily of stock options.
908259_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	The valuation of stock options is an inherently subjective process, since market values are not available for any stock options in our equity securities.
908259_18_ITEM7_P8_S3	Market values are also not available on long-term, non-transferable stock options in other equity securities.
908259_18_ITEM7_P8_S4	With no market values on options to trade in our common stock and no comparable market values on any long-term non-transferable stock options, the process of valuing our stock options is even more uncertain and subjective.
908259_18_ITEM7_P8_S5	Accordingly, we use a Black-Scholes option pricing model to derive an estimated fair value of the stock options which we issue.
908259_18_ITEM7_P8_S6	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires certain input assumptions, including the expected term of the options and the expected volatility of our common stock.
908259_18_ITEM7_P8_S7	Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value that we record for share-based payments that we issue.
908259_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	We determine the term of the options based on the simplified method, which averages the vesting period and the contractual life of the stock option.
908259_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	We determine the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term.
908259_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	The Black-Scholes option pricing model also requires assumptions for risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock, but we feel that these values are more objective and note that changes in these values do not have a significant impact on the estimated value of the options when compared to the volatility and term assumptions.
908259_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	We are also required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
908259_18_ITEM7_P10_S3	Accordingly, we perform a historical analysis of option awards that are forfeited prior to vesting, and record total stock option expense that reflects this estimated forfeiture rate.
908259_18_ITEM7_P10_S4	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 Research and Development expenses The table below summarizes the most significant components of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated and provides the amount and percentage change in these components (in thousands):
908259_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Research and development expenses increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to our clinical studies.
908259_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	We incurred significantly higher expenses for clinical studies in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher costs for our FOCUS study of CA4P in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer prior to the study s termination in late September 2017.
908259_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	When we terminated the FOCUS study we had enrolled a total of approximately 90 patients, compared to approximately 20 at the end of 2016.
908259_18_ITEM7_P11_S3	Direct costs for the FOCUS study were approximately $4.4 million in 2017 compared to $1.9 million in 2016, an increase of $2.5 million.
908259_18_ITEM7_P11_S4	In addition to our FOCUS study, we incurred clinical study expenses for the OX1222 study, which is our on-going trial of OXi4503 in acute myeloid leukemia.
908259_18_ITEM7_P11_S5	Expenses for the AML clinical trial were comparable in 2017 and 2016, at approximately $1.3 million each year.
908259_18_ITEM7_P11_S6	Besides the above-noted clinical trials in ovarian cancer and AML, which comprised the majority of our research and development efforts, in 2017 we also incurred higher expenses investigating CA4P as an immune-oncology agent, which approximately offsets a decrease in clinical expenses incurred investigating CA4P in neuroendocrine tumors.
908259_18_ITEM7_P11_S7	Employee compensation and related expenses declined in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to our termination of the majority of employees immediately after we terminated the FOCUS study.
908259_18_ITEM7_P11_S8	These lower employee compensation costs were partially offset by severance expenses.
908259_18_ITEM7_P11_S9	Employee stock-based compensation was lower in 2017 than 2016 due to a lower average number of employees in 2017 as a result of the 2017 employee terminations.
908259_18_ITEM7_P11_S10	The percentage decline in stock-based compensation was lower than it was for employee compensation due to the grant levels of the specific employees who were terminated in 2017 and certain options which continued to vest for a former employee under a consulting agreement.
908259_18_ITEM7_P11_S11	Consulting and professional services decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to cutbacks across virtually all areas, except for additional expenses incurred in the first two quarters of 2017 associated with recruiting patients into our FOCUS clinical trial.
908259_18_ITEM7_P11_S12	Drug manufacturing expenses decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher expenses incurred in 2016 for supplying and labeling investigational drug for the FOCUS study.
908259_18_ITEM7_P11_S13	Other expenses include facility related expenses and were generally comparable between the 2017 and 2016 periods, with changes not significant.
908259_18_ITEM7_P11_S14	Our future research and development expenses will be dependent upon our ability to secure sufficient funding to continue drug development activities.
908259_18_ITEM7_P11_S15	We expect to prioritize obtaining additional clinical data for our OX1222 Study of OXi4503 in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia and obtaining initial data combining CA4P with an approved immuno-oncology agent.
908259_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	General and administrative expenses The table below summarizes the most significant components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated and the amount and percentage change in these components (in thousands):
908259_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	General and administrative expenses decreased in 2017 due to cut-backs in our operations.
908259_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	Employee compensation and related expenses decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to reduced average headcount in 2017 and the lack of any 2017 incentive bonus expense as a result of the Company s very low level of cash at the end of 2017.
908259_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	The increase in stock-based compensation in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to additional emphasis on equity compensation over cash compensation in 2017 due to the Company s generally low cash levels throughout the year.
908259_18_ITEM7_P13_S3	Consulting and professional services decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to reduced expenses across nearly all external general and administrative services used, other than business development, and higher one-time market research costs incurred at the beginning of 2016.
908259_18_ITEM7_P13_S4	Other expenses, which include facility related expenses and insurance expenses, decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to lower costs across most areas, none of which were individually significant.
908259_18_ITEM7_P13_S5	Our future general and administrative expenses will be dependent upon our ability to secure sufficient funding to continue operations.
908259_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We measure liquidity by the cash and other capital we have available to fund our operations, which are primarily focused on the development of our drug candidates.
908259_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	To date, we have financed our operations principally through proceeds received from the sale of equity.
908259_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	We have experienced net losses in each year since our inception, and negative cash flows from operations in nearly every year.
908259_18_ITEM7_P14_S3	As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $292 million, including a net loss of approximately $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
908259_18_ITEM7_P14_S4	As of December 31, 2017, we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.1 million, which, together with net proceeds of approximately $2.4 million received in a financing transaction entered into on April 12, 2018, we expect to be sufficient to fund our planned operating activities into the fourth quarter of 2018.
908259_18_ITEM7_P14_S5	If we are unable to secure additional funding prior to this time, we may be required to scale back or conclude our development activities altogether.
908259_18_ITEM7_P14_S6	We will require additional capital before we can complete the development of OXi4503 and CA4P. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
908259_18_ITEM7_P14_S7	If we are unable to access additional funds in the near term we may not be able to continue the development of our product candidates and we could be required to terminate operations altogether.
908259_18_ITEM7_P14_S8	Any additional equity financing, if available, may not be available on favorable terms and would be dilutive to our current stockholders.
908259_18_ITEM7_P14_S9	Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could also be dilutive to our current stockholders.
908259_18_ITEM7_P14_S10	If we are able to access funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own, on terms that are not favorable to us.
908259_18_ITEM7_P14_S11	Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if access is not achieved on a timely basis, will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
908259_18_ITEM7_P14_S12	The following table presents information regarding payments required to be made on our non-cancelable contractual obligations, which consists of our facility lease, as of December 31, 2017:
908259_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our current drug development programs are based on a series of compounds called combretastatins, which we have exclusively licensed from Arizona State University, or ASU.
908259_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	If our current drug candidates are approved, we will be required to pay low to mid-single-digit royalties on future net sales of products associated with the ASU patent rights until these patent rights expire.
908259_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	We also have an exclusive license from Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, for certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including CA4P.
908259_18_ITEM7_P15_S3	If CA4P is approved, we will be required to pay low-single-digit royalties on future net sales of products associated with the BMS patent rights until these patent rights expire.
908259_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	and short-term investments are maintained in U.S. dollar accounts.
908259_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We have adopted a policy for the cash, cash equivalents and investments that we hold, the primary objective of which is to preserve principal, while also maintaining liquidity to meet our operating needs and maximize yields to the extent possible.
908259_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Although our investments are subject to credit risk, we follow procedures to limit the amount of credit exposure in any single issue, issuer or type of investment.
908259_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and would be likely to decrease in value if market interest rates increase.
908259_18_ITEM7A_P0_S4	However, due to the generally conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration, we believe that interest rate risk is mitigated.
908259_18_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Although we may from time to time manufacture drugs and conduct trials and studies outside of the United States, we believe our exposure to foreign currency risk to be immaterial.
908259_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	Statements and Schedules and any supplementary financial information filed as part of this Annual Report.
908259_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission requires that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and the Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) and report on the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
908259_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of December 31, 2017, to ensure that we record, process, summarize and report the information we must disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
908259_18_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, identified in connection with the evaluation of such control that occurred during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
908259_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
908259_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework).
908259_18_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017.
908259_18_ITEM9A_P1_S3	This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
908259_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC.
908259_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud.
908259_18_ITEM9A_P3_S1	In particular, the very small size of our company necessitates that there is less segregation of duties than there is at most other companies.
908259_18_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time.
908259_18_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.
908259_18_ITEM9A_P3_S4	Because we are not an accelerated filer, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, OUM Co., LLP was not required to issue an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting and, therefore, did not perform for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 an audit of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

908259_18_ITEM10_P24_S1	The Compensation Committee also makes recommendations to the Board regarding the design and implementation of our compensation plans and the establishment of criteria and the approval of performance results relative to our incentive plans.

908259_18_ITEM10_P26_S1	Adjustments to base salary are generally only made when there has been a change in the scope of the responsibilities of the named executive officer or when, based on a review of the base salary component of executive officers in companies of a similar size and stage of development, the Compensation Committee members believe that an adjustment is warranted in order to remain competitive.
908259_18_ITEM10_P27_S0	The executive management of the Company determines and agrees with the Compensation Committee on its corporate goals and objectives for the ensuing year.

908259_18_ITEM13_P2_S0	Dr. Chaplin is a resident of the United Kingdom, and during 2016 the services he performed for Mateon while in the United Kingdom were conducted through Aston Biopharma LTD, an entity which Dr. Chaplin controlled, while the payment for services Dr. Chaplin performed for Mateon while he was in the United States were made directly to Dr. Chaplin.
908259_18_ITEM13_P2_S1	We paid Aston Biopharma LTD approximately $105,750 as compensation for services Dr. Chaplin performed while he was in the United Kingdom during 2016, and his compensation for services as an employee was reduced by this amount.
908259_18_ITEM13_P2_S2	Aston Biopharma LTD and Mateon terminated the consultancy agreement effective as of January 1, 2017 and all payments for Dr. Chaplin s services were thereafter made directly to Dr. Chaplin.

908259_18_ITEM13_P3_S0	On April 12, 2018, we closed a private placement transaction in which we received net proceeds of approximately $2.4 million.
908259_18_ITEM13_P3_S1	The private placement transaction consisted of the sale of 58.5 units at a purchase price of $50,000 per unit, and each unit contained 250,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to 250,000 shares of our common stock.

908259_18_ITEM13_P3_S3	Dr. Schwieterman purchased 2.5 units and Mr. Loar and Mr. Reynolds each purchased one unit in the private placement transaction.
908259_18_ITEM13_P4_S0	The purchases of Dr. Schwieterman, Mr. Loar and Mr. Reynolds were reviewed in advance by disinterested directors on the Audit Committee.
908259_18_ITEM14_P0_S0	professional audit services rendered by our independent public accounting firm, OUM Co., LLP, for the audit of the Company s annual financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and fees billed for other services rendered during those periods.
908259_18_ITEM14_P1_S0	(1) Audit fees consisted of audit work performed on the audit of the annual financial statements, review of quarterly financial statements, as well as work that generally only the independent registered public accounting firm can reasonably be expected to provide, such as the provision of consents and comfort letters in connection with the filing of registration statements and statutory audits.
908259_18_ITEM14_P1_S1	We engaged OUM Co., LLP as our independent public accounting firm on December 9, 2016 and accordingly did not incur any OUM costs for the review of our quarterly financial statements in 2016.
908259_18_ITEM14_P1_S2	Prior to December 9, 2016 we used Ernst Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm.
908259_18_ITEM14_P2_S0	Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Consistent with SEC policies regarding auditor independence, the Audit Committee has responsibility for appointing, setting compensation, and overseeing the work of the independent registered public accounting firm.
908259_18_ITEM14_P2_S1	In recognition of this responsibility, the Audit Committee has established a policy to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm.
908259_18_ITEM14_P3_S0	Prior to engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm for the next year s audit, management will submit an aggregate of services expected to be rendered during that year for each of four categories of services to the Audit Committee for approval.
908259_18_ITEM14_P4_S0	Audit services include audit work performed in the preparation and audit of the annual financial statements, review of quarterly financial statements, as well as work that generally only the independent auditor can reasonably be expected to provide, such as the provision of consents and comfort letters in connection with the filing of registration statements.
908259_18_ITEM14_P5_S0	Audit-related services are for assurance and related services that are traditionally performed by the independent auditor, including due diligence related to mergers and acquisitions, employee benefit plan audits, and special procedures required to meet certain regulatory requirements.
908259_18_ITEM14_P6_S0	Tax services consist principally of assistance with tax compliance and reporting, as well as certain tax planning consultations.
908259_18_ITEM14_P7_S0	Other Fees are those associated with services not captured in the other categories.
908259_18_ITEM14_P7_S1	The Company generally does not request such services from the independent auditor.
908259_18_ITEM14_P7_S2	Prior to engagement, the Audit Committee pre-approves these services by category of service.
908259_18_ITEM14_P7_S3	The fees are budgeted, and the Audit Committee requires the independent registered public accounting firm and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically throughout the year by category of service.
908259_18_ITEM14_P8_S0	During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval.
908259_18_ITEM14_P8_S1	In those instances, the Audit Committee requires specific pre-approval before engaging the independent registered public accounting firm.
908259_18_ITEM14_P9_S0	The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members.
908259_18_ITEM14_P9_S1	The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.

908259_18_ITEM15_P9_S0	The following financial statements of Mateon Therapeutics, Inc.:
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Stockholders and Board of Directors Mateon Therapeutics, Inc.
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S1	South San Francisco, California Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Mateon Therapeutics, Inc. (the Company ) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related statements of comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S2	In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2017 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S3	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S4	As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit and a working capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S5	Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2.
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S6	The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S7	Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S8	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits.
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S9	( PCAOB ) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S10	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S11	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S12	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S13	As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S14	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S15	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S16	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S17	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S18	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
908259_18_ITEM15_P10_S19	LLP San Francisco, California April 17, 2018 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2016.
908259_18_ITEM15_P11_S0	Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands) See accompanying notes.
908259_18_ITEM15_P12_S0	Description of Business Mateon Therapeutics, Inc. ( Mateon or the Company ) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical developing drugs for the treatment of orphan oncology indications, with its lead program in acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ).
908259_18_ITEM15_P12_S1	The Company was originally incorporated under the name OXiGENE, Inc. in 1988 in the state of New York and reincorporated in 1992 in the state of Delaware.
908259_18_ITEM15_P12_S2	Effective June 17, 2016, the Company changed its name to Mateon Therapeutics, Inc.
908259_18_ITEM15_P13_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
908259_18_ITEM15_P13_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
908259_18_ITEM15_P14_S0	Cash Equivalents Highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.
908259_18_ITEM15_P14_S1	Cash equivalents are stated at fair value.
908259_18_ITEM15_P15_S0	Short-term Investments All marketable securities have been classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, based upon quoted market prices.
908259_18_ITEM15_P15_S1	The Company considers its available-for-sale portfolio to be available for use in current operations.
908259_18_ITEM15_P15_S2	Accordingly, the Company classifies certain investments as short-term marketable securities, even though the stated maturity date may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet date.
908259_18_ITEM15_P16_S0	Unrealized gains and losses, if material, net of any related tax effects, are excluded from earnings and are included in other comprehensive income and reported as a separate component of stockholders deficit until realized.
908259_18_ITEM15_P17_S0	Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary, if any, on available-for-sale securities are included in other income (expense), net.
908259_18_ITEM15_P18_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method.
908259_18_ITEM15_P18_S1	Concentration of Credit Risk The Company has no significant off balance sheet concentrations of credit risk.
908259_18_ITEM15_P18_S2	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and short-term investments, which consist of U.S. government treasury bills, corporate bonds and commercial paper.
908259_18_ITEM15_P18_S3	The Company holds its cash and short-term investments with one financial institution.
908259_18_ITEM15_P18_S4	Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company measures and reports its cash equivalents and investments at fair value.
908259_18_ITEM15_P18_S5	Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
908259_18_ITEM15_P19_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are recorded and stated at cost.
908259_18_ITEM15_P20_S0	Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years, or the applicable lease term, whichever is less.
908259_18_ITEM15_P21_S0	The Company utilizes contract research organizations ( CROs ), independent clinical investigators, and other third-party service providers to assist with the execution of its clinical trials.
908259_18_ITEM15_P21_S1	The Company records costs for clinical trial activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced for each clinical trial, and includes these costs in accrued liabilities on its Balance Sheets and within research and development expenses on its Statements of Comprehensive Loss.
908259_18_ITEM15_P21_S2	Contracts for clinical trials vary significantly in length and are usually composed of a fixed management fee, variable indirect reimbursable costs, monthly costs and amounts owed on a per patient basis.
908259_18_ITEM15_P21_S3	The Company monitors both the activity and patient enrollment levels of each clinical trial to the extent possible through communication with each service provider, detailed invoice and task completion review, analysis of actual expenses against budget, pre-approval of any changes in scope, and review of contractual terms.
908259_18_ITEM15_P21_S4	As a result, accrued clinical trial expenses represent the Company s reasonably estimated contractual liability to outside service providers at any particular point in time.
908259_18_ITEM15_P21_S5	These estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the service providers as determined by actual patient enrollment levels and other variable activity costs.
908259_18_ITEM15_P22_S0	Research and Development Expenses The Company charges all research and development costs, both internal and external, to expense when incurred.
908259_18_ITEM15_P22_S1	The Company s research and development expenses consist primarily of clinical trial expenses, personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, costs associated with manufacturing the Company s drug product for clinical use and required regulatory filings, licenses and fees, and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facility-related costs.
908259_18_ITEM15_P22_S2	Clinical trial expenses represent a significant component of the Company s research and development expenses.
908259_18_ITEM15_P22_S3	A large portion of the costs for the Company s clinical trials are paid to or through CROs.
908259_18_ITEM15_P22_S4	The Company monitors levels of services provided under each significant contract including the extent of patient enrollment and other activities through communications with its CROs and with investigator sites.
908259_18_ITEM15_P22_S5	Costs are accrued for clinical studies performed by CROs over the service periods specified in the contracts and estimates are adjusted, if required, based upon ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs.
908259_18_ITEM15_P23_S0	The manufacturing of the Company s drug investigational drugs is outsourced to third-party manufacturers.
908259_18_ITEM15_P23_S1	The drug manufacturing costs are expensed as incurred.
908259_18_ITEM15_P23_S2	For the periods presented, there are no components of other comprehensive income or accumulated comprehensive income and the net loss is equal to the comprehensive loss.
908259_18_ITEM15_P24_S0	Stock-based Compensation The Company expenses the estimated fair value of all share-based payments issued to employees on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
908259_18_ITEM15_P24_S1	The Company has equity incentive plans that provides for the award of stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights to employees, directors and consultants to the Company.
908259_18_ITEM15_P25_S0	The Company has filed applications for patents in connection with various product candidates and technologies being developed.
908259_18_ITEM15_P25_S1	Costs associated with patent applications and maintaining patents are expensed as general and administrative expense as incurred.
908259_18_ITEM15_P26_S0	Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method whereby tax rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes based on when and how they are expected to affect the tax return.
908259_18_ITEM15_P26_S1	The Company reviews all activity subsequent to year end but prior to the issuance of the financial statements for events that could require disclosure or which could impact the carrying value of assets or liabilities as of the balance sheet date.
908259_18_ITEM15_P27_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-2, Leases (Topic 842), which requires substantially all leases, including operating leases, to be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability.
908259_18_ITEM15_P27_S1	This ASU is effective for the Company s interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted.
908259_18_ITEM15_P27_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on its financial statements.
908259_18_ITEM15_P27_S3	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplified several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments, including immediate recognition of all excess tax benefits and deficiencies in the income statement, changing the threshold to qualify for equity classification up to the employees maximum statutory tax rates, allowing an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur, and clarifying the classification on the statement of cash flows for the excess tax benefit and employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes.
908259_18_ITEM15_P27_S4	This ASU became effective for the Company s interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2017, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
908259_18_ITEM15_P27_S5	As part of the adoption of this standard, the Company elected to continue estimating the expected option forfeiture rate.
908259_18_ITEM15_P28_S0	In August 2016, The FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which addresses several cash flow issues that diversify in practice.
908259_18_ITEM15_P28_S1	The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017 and for interim periods within those years.
908259_18_ITEM15_P28_S2	The Company currently does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have material impact on its financial statements.
908259_18_ITEM15_P29_S0	The Company has experienced net losses every year since inception and, as of December 31, 2017, had an accumulated deficit of over $292 million.
908259_18_ITEM15_P29_S1	The company has no source of revenue and does not expect to receive any product revenue in the near future.
908259_18_ITEM15_P29_S2	The Company expects to incur significant additional operating losses over at least the next several years, principally as a result of the Company s continuing clinical trials for its investigational drugs.
908259_18_ITEM15_P30_S0	As of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $1.1 million in cash and current liabilities of $1.6 million.
908259_18_ITEM15_P30_S1	Following the receipt of an estimated $2.4 million in net proceeds from a financing transaction in April 2018, based on the Company s planned operations, the Company s management expects Mateon s existing cash to support its planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2018.
908259_18_ITEM15_P30_S2	Prior to this time, the Company will need to secure additional funding or could be forced to curtail or terminate operations.
908259_18_ITEM15_P30_S3	Because the Company does not currently have a guaranteed source of working capital that will sustain planned operations past the fourth quarter of 2018, Management has determined that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
908259_18_ITEM15_P30_S4	The Company will need to raise capital in order to fund its planned operations beyond this time.
908259_18_ITEM15_P30_S5	If the Company is unable to access additional funds when needed, it may not be able to continue the development of its investigational drugs and the Company could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of its development programs and other operations.
908259_18_ITEM15_P30_S6	Any additional equity financing, if available to the Company, may not be available on favorable terms, would most likely be dilutive to its current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.

908259_18_ITEM15_P33_S0	Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value.
908259_18_ITEM15_P33_S1	Hierarchical levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities are as follows: Level 1 Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the reporting date.
908259_18_ITEM15_P34_S0	Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide reasonably accurate pricing information on an ongoing basis.
908259_18_ITEM15_P35_S0	Level 2 Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the reporting date and for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life.
908259_18_ITEM15_P35_S1	The Company utilizes third party pricing services in developing fair value measurements where fair value is based on observable market inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers and other reference data.

908259_18_ITEM15_P41_S2	The fair values for the stock options granted were estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:
908259_18_ITEM15_P42_S0	In calculating the estimated fair value of its stock options, the Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires the consideration of the following variables for purposes of estimating fair value:
