1094392_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	General Rudolph Technologies, Inc. is a worldwide leader in the design, development, and manufacture of high-performance process control defect inspection, metrology, and process control software systems used by microelectronics device manufacturers.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	We provide yield management solutions used in both wafer processing and final manufacturing through a family of standalone systems for macro-defect inspection, test systems, and transparent and opaque thin film measurements.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	All of these systems feature sophisticated software and production-worthy automation.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P0_S3	In addition, our advanced process control portfolio includes powerful solutions to enhance productivity and achieve significant cost savings.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Rudolph systems are backed by worldwide customer service and applications support.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	The acquisition of selected assets related to MKS Instruments' Yield Dynamics software business was announced on August 11, 2010.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	The products and technology included patented analytical techniques for yield improvement that are complementary to Rudolph's existing yield management and process control portfolio.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P2_S2	Over 30 engineering and applications personnel joined Rudolph following the closing of the transaction.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P2_S3	In March 2010, the John P. Kummer Group became Rudolph's distribution partner for our probe card test and analysis products in Europe.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P2_S4	This followed with our appointment of STAr Technologies as an authorized vendor for probe card interfaces in Asia.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P2_S5	Both of these companies have increased our presence in these growing markets.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Chip manufacturers deploy advanced macro-defect inspection throughout the fab to monitor key process steps, gather process-enhancing information and ultimately, lower manufacturing costs.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	Field-established tools such as the AXi and NSX inspection systems are found in wafer processing (front-end) and final manufacturing (back-end) facilities around the world.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P3_S2	These high-speed tools incorporate features such as waferless recipe creation, tool-to-tool correlation and multiple inspection resolut ions.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P3_S3	In addition to wafer frontside inspection, Rudolph's innovative Explorer Inspection Cluster incorporates wafer edge and backside inspection in one integrated platform to enhance productivity and continuously improve fab yield.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	Using products such as Discover and Genesis software, the vast amount of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed and classified to determine trends that ultimately affect yield.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	Rudolph's patented transparent film technology uses up to four lasers operating simultaneously at multiple angles and multiple wavelengths, providing powerful analysis and measurement capabilities.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	Unlike the white-light sources used in spectroscopic ellipsometers, laser light sources make our metrology tools inherently stable, increase measurement speed and accuracy, and reduce maintenance costs by minimizing the time required to re-qualify a light source when it is replaced.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	Rudolph's S3000S System employs a proprietary reflectometer technology that allows the characterization of films and film stacks that cannot be performed using conventional reflectometry or ellipsometry alone.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	For opaque film characterization, the MetaPULSE System gives customers the ability to simultaneously measure the thickness and other properties of up to six metal or other opaque film layers in a non-contact manner on product wafers.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	PULSE Technology uses an ultra-fast laser to generate sound waves that pass down through a stack of opaque films such as those used in copper or aluminum interconnect processes, sending back to the surface an echo that indicates film thickness, density, and other process critical parameters.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	We believe we are a leader in providing systems that can non-destructively measure opaque thin-film stacks with the speed and accuracy semiconductor device manufacturers demand in order to achieve high yields with the latest fabrication processes.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P7_S2	The technology is ideal for characterizing copper interconnect structures and the majority of all systems sold have been for copper applications.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	Rudolph has a comprehensive offering of total process control software solutions for semiconductor, solar and LED manufacturing.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	We provide a wide range of advanced process control solutions, all designed to improve factory profitability, including run-to-run control, fault detection, classification and tool automation.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	Rudolph is the #1 provider of Process Control Software in the semiconductor industry.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	Technology We believe that our expertise in engineering and our continued investment in research and development enable us to rapidly develop new technologies and products in response to emerging industry trends.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	The breadth of our technology enables us to offer our customers a diverse combination of measurement technologies that provide process control for the majority of thin films used in semiconductor manufacturing.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P10_S2	Additionally, our defect detection and classification technologies allow us to provide yield enhancement for critical front-end processes such as photolithography, diffusion, etch, CMP, and outgoing quality control.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	Information learned through post-fab inspection is critical.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	Advanced macro-d efect inspection within the final manufacturing (back-end) process provides our customers with critical quality assurance and process information.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing or general handling, and can have a major impact on device and process quality.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	Automating the defect detection and classification process is best done by a system that can mimic, or even extend, the response of the human eye, but at a much higher speed, with high resolution and more consistently.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	To do this, our systems capture full-color whole wafer images using simultaneous dark and bright field illumination.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P13_S2	The resulting bright and dark field images are compared to t hose from an ideal wafer having no defects.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P13_S3	When a difference is detected, its image is broken down into mathematical vectors that allow rapid and accurate comparison with a library of known classified defects stored in the tool's database.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P13_S4	Patented and proprietary enhancements of this approach enable very fast and highly repeatable image classification.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P13_S5	The system is pre-programmed with an extensive library of default local, global, and color defects and can also absorb a virtually unlimited amount of new defect classes.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P13_S6	This allows customers to define defects based on their existing defect classification system, provides more reliable automated rework decisions, and enables more accurate statistical process control data.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	All-surface refers to inspection of the wafer frontside, edge, and backside as well as post-fab die.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	The edge inspection process focuses on the area near the wafer edge, an area that poses difficulty for traditional wafer frontside inspection technology due to its varied topography and process variation.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	Edge bevel inspection looks for defects on the side edge of a wafer.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	The edge bead removal and edge exclusion metrology involve a topside surface measurement required exclusively in the photolithography process, primarily to determine if wafers have been properly aligned for the edge exclusion region.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	The primary reason for wafer backside inspection is to determine if contamination has been created that may spread throughout the fab.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	For instance, it is critical that the wafer backside be free of defects prior to the photolithography process to prevent focus and exposure problems on the wafer front-side.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	In addition to the wafer processing floor, Rudolph's automated inspection systems are used in several post-fab processes such as bump inspection, wafer probe, wafer saw and quality control.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P17_S3	Classifying defects off-line enables automated inspection systems to maintain their high throughput.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P17_S4	Using defect image files captured by automated inspection systems, operators are able to view high-resolution defect images to determine defects that cause catastrophic failure of a device, or killer defects.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P17_S5	Classifying defects enables faster analysis by grouping defects found together as one larger defect, a scratch for example, and defects of similar types across a wafer lot to be grouped based on size, repeating defects and other user-defined specifications.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P17_S6	Automatically classifying defects provides far greater yield learning than human classification.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	Using wafer maps, charts and graphs, the vast amounts of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed to determine trends across bumps, die, wafers and lots.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	This analysis may determine where in the process an inconsistency is being introduced, allowing for enhancements to be made and yields improved.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	Defect data analysis is performed to identify, analyze and locate the source of defects and other manufacturing process excursions.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	or a composite map created from multiple wafer maps, this analysis enables identification of defect patterns and distribution.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	When combined with inspection data from strategically-placed inspection points, this analysis may pinpoint the source of the defects so corrective action can be taken.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	The combination of Fast 3D-OCM (optical comparative metrology) Technology with improved testing accuracy and repeatability is designed to reduce total test time for even the most advanced large area probe cards.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P20_S3	3-D capabilities enable users to analyze probe marks and probe tips in a rapid and information-rich format.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	Optical acoustic metrology involves the use of ultra-fast laser induced sonar for metal and opaqu e thin film measurement.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	This technology sends ultrasonic waves into multi-layer opaque films and then analyzes the resulting echoes to simultaneously determine the thickness of each individual layer in complex multi-layer metal film stacks.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P21_S2	The echo's amplitude and phase can be used to detect film properties, missing layers, and interlayer problems.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P21_S3	Since different phenomena affect amplitude and phase uniquely, a variety of process critical interlayer problems can be detected in a single measurement.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	The use of optical acoustics to measure multi-layer metal and opaque films was pioneered by scientists at Brown University ( Brown ) in collaboration with engineers at Rudolph.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	The proprietary optical acoustic technology in our PULSE Technology systems measures the thickness of single or multi-layer opaque films ranging from less than 40 Angstroms to greater than five microns.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	It provides these measurements at a rate of up to 70 wafers per hour within one to two percent accuracy and typically less than one percent repeatability.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P22_S3	This range of thicknesses covers the majority of thick and thin metal films projected by the International Roadmap for Semiconductors to be used through the end of this decade.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our non-contact, non-destructive optical acoustic technology and small spot size enable our PULSE Technology systems to measure film properties directly on product wafers.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	Ellipsometry is a non-contact, non-destructive optical technique for transparent thin film measurement.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	We have been an industry leader in ellipsometry technology for the last three decades.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P24_S2	We hold patents on several ellipsometry technologies, including our proprietary technique that uses four lasers for multiple-angle of incidence, multiple wavelength ellipsometry.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P24_S3	Laser ellipsometry technology enables our transparent film systems to continue to provide the increasingly higher level of accuracy needed as thinner films and newer materials are introduced for future generations of semiconductor devices.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P24_S4	We extended this same optical technology to characterize the scatterometry signal from patterned surfaces, allowing measurement of critical dimensions.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P24_S5	For applications requiring broader spectral coverage, some of our ellipsometry tools are also equipped with a reflectometer.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	Reflectometry uses a white or ultraviolet light source to determine the properties of transparent thin films by analyzing the wavelength and intensity of light reflected from the surface of a wafer.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	This optical information is processed with software algorithms to determine film thickness and other material properties.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	By combining data from both the laser ellipsometer and broad spectrum reflectometer, it is possible to characterize films and film stacks that cannot be adequately analyzed by either method individually.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Adva nced Process Control ("APC") employs software to automatically detect or predict tool failure (fault detection) as well as calculate recipe settings for a process that will drive the process output to target despite variations in the incoming material and disturbances within the process equipment.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	Process control software enables the factory to increase capacity and yield and to decrease rework and scrap.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	It enables reduced production costs by lowering consumables, process engineering time and manufacturing cycle time.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	Products We market and sell prod ucts to all major logic, memory, data storage and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) device manufacturers.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	Our customers rely on Rudolph for versatile full-fab inspection and metrology systems as well as process control software solutions.

1094392_11_ITEM1_P28_S3	See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information concerning our geographic information.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	We depend on a relatively small number of customers and end users for a large percentage of our revenues.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	In the years 2008, 2009 and 2010, sales to end user customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for 36.3%, 44.8% and 44.4% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P29_S2	In 2008 and 2009, sales to Intel Corporation accounted for 10.9% and 13.6 % of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P29_S3	In 2010, sales to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and, Samsung Semiconductor Inc. accounted for 13.9% and 11.2% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P29_S4	No other individual end user customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2008, 2009 and 2010.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P29_S5	We do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	Research and Development The macro-defect inspection, thin film transparent and opaque process control metrology market is characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	We believe that the rapid and ongo ing development of new products and enhancements to existing products is critical to our success.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P30_S2	Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our technical, management and financial resources to research and development programs.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P30_S3	The core competencies of our research and development team include metrology systems for high volume manufacturing, ellipsometry, ultra-fast optics, picosecond acoustic and optical design, advanced metrology application development and algorithm development.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P30_S4	To leverage our internal research and development capabilities, we maintain close relationships with leading research institutions in the metrology field, including Brown University.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P30_S5	Our relationship with Brown University has resulted in the development of the optical acoustic technology underlying our Meta PULSE product line.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P30_S6	We have been granted exclusive licenses from Brown University Research Foundation, subject to rights retained by Brown and the United States government for their own non-commercial uses for several patents relating to this technology.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P30_S7	Our research and development expenditures in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 were $31.6 million , $26.0 million and $33.4 million , respectively.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P30_S8	We plan to continue our strong commitment to new product development in the future, and we expect that our level of research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollar terms in future periods.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	We maintain an extensive network of direct sales, customer service and application support offices in several locations throughout the world.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	We maintain sales, service or applications offices in locations including, but not limited to, New Jersey, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Texas, Washington, New York, Scotland, Israel, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, China and Japan.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	We provide our customers with comprehensive support before, during and after the delivery of our products.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P31_S3	For example, in order to facilitate the smooth integration of our tools into our customers operations, we of ten assign dedicated, site-specific field service and applications engineers to provide long-term support at selected customer sites.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P31_S4	We also provide comprehensive service and applications training for customers at our training facility in Budd Lake, New Jersey and at customer locations.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P31_S5	In addition, we maintain a group of highly skilled applications scientists at strategically located facilities throughout the world and at selected customer locations.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	Manufacturing Our principal manufacturing activities include assembly, final test and calibration.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	These activities are conducted in our manufacturing facilities in Minnesota.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P32_S2	During the fourth quarter of 2009, we initiated a consolidation of a portion of our facility in Budd Lake, NJ and in 2010 we moved the New Jersey manufacturing operations to our facility in Bloomington, MN.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P32_S3	Our core manufacturing competencies include electrical, optical and mechanical assembly and testing as well as the management of new product transitions.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P32_S4	While we use standard components and subassemblies wherever possible, most mechanical parts, metal fabrications and critical components used in our products are engineered and manufactured to our specifications.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P32_S5	We expect to rely increasingly on subcontractors and turnkey suppliers to fabricate components, build assemblies and perform other non-core activities in a cost-effective manner.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P32_S6	We rely on a num ber of limited source suppliers for certain parts and subassemblies.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P32_S7	This reliance creates a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components, and reduced control over pricing and time of delivery of components.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P32_S8	An inability to obtain adequate supplies would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or might require us to redesign our systems to accommodate different components or subassemblies.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P32_S9	To date, we have not experienced any significant delivery delays.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	redesign our products, this could prevent us from shipping our products to our customers on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	We have a policy of seeking patents on inventions governing new products or technologies as part of our ongoing research, develo pment, and manufacturing activities.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we have been granted, or hold exclusive licenses to, 192 U.S. and foreign patents.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	The patents we own, jointly own or exclusively license have expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2029.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P34_S3	We also have 101 pending regular and provisional applications in the U.S. and other countries.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P34_S4	Our patents and applications principally cover various aspects of macro-defect detection and classification, transparent thin film measurement and altered material characterization.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P34_S5	We have been granted exclusive licenses from Brown University Research Foundation, subject to rights retained by Brown and the United States government for their own non-commercial uses, for several patents relating to the optical acoustic technology underlying our Meta PULSE product family.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P34_S6	The terms of these exclusive licenses are equal to the lives of the patents.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P34_S7	We pay royalties to Brown based upon a percentage of our revenues from the sale of systems that incorporate technology covered by the Brown patents.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P34_S8	We also have the right to support patent activity with respect to new ultra-fast acoustic technology developed by Brown scientists, and to acquire exclusive licenses to this technology.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P34_S9	Brown may terminate the licenses if we fail to pay royalties to Brown or if we materially breach our license agreement with Brown.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P34_S10	Our pending patents may never be issued, and even if they are, these patents, our existing patents and the patents we license may not provide sufficiently broad protection to protect our proprietary rights, or they may prove to be unenforceable.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P34_S11	To protect our proprietary rights, we also rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions and licenses.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P34_S12	There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P34_S13	The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same degree as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial infringement problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in such countries, some of which are countries in which we have sold and continue to sell pro ducts.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P34_S14	There is a risk that our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P34_S15	For example, our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P34_S16	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	Competition The market for semiconductor capital equipment is highly competitive.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	We face substantial competition from established companies in each of the markets that we serve.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P35_S2	We principally compete with KLA-Tenco r and Camtek.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P35_S3	We compete to a lesser extent with companies such as Nanometrics, Vistec, and Nikon.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P35_S4	Each of our products also competes with products that use different metrology techniques.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P35_S5	Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, broader product offerings and service capabilities and larger installed customer bases than we do.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P35_S6	Significant competitive factors in the market for inspection and metrology systems include system performance, ease of use, reliability, cost of ownership, technical support and customer relationships.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P35_S7	We believe that, while price and delivery are important competitive factors, the customers overriding requirement is for a product that meets their technical capabilities.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P35_S8	To remain competitive, we believe we will need to maintain a high level of investment in resea rch and development and process applications.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P35_S9	No assurances can be given that we will continue to be competitive in the future.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	Backlog We schedule production of our systems based upon order backlog and informal customer forecasts.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	We include in backlog only those orders to which the customer has assigned a purchase order number and for which delivery is anticipated within 12 months.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P36_S2	Because shipment dates may be changed and customers may cancel or delay orders with little or no penalty, our backlog as of any particular date ma y not be a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P36_S3	At December 31, 2010 , we had a backlog of approximately $49.7 million compared with a backlog of approximately $54.1 million at December 31, 2009 .
1094392_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	Employees As of December 31, 2010 , we had 550 employees.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements, and we have never experienced a work stoppage.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	We believe our employee relations are good.
1094392_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	Available Information We were incorporated in New Jersey in 1958 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1999.

1094392_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and will likely continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, causing volatility in our stock price.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Some of the factors that may influence our operating results and subject our stock to extreme price and volume fluctuations include:
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	the levels of our fixed expenses, including research and development costs associated with product development, relative to our revenue levels.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In light of these factors and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Moreover, many of our expenses are fixed in the short-term which, together with the need for continued investment in research and development, marketing and customer support, limits our ability to reduce expenses quickly.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P1_S3	As a result, declines in net sales could harm our business and the pri ce of our common stock could substantially decline.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our largest customers account for a significant portion of our revenues, and our revenues and cash flows could significantly decline if one or more of these customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems or they delayed or cancelled a large order Sales to end user customers that individually represent at least five percent of our revenues typically account for, in the aggregate, a considerable amount of our revenues.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We operate in the highly concentrated, capital-intensive semiconductor device manufacturing industry.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Historically, a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to rela tively few customers, and this trend is expected to continue.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	If any of our key customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems in the future, or if a large order were delayed or cancelled, our revenues and cash flows could significantly decline.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We expect that we will continue to depend on a small number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenues.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P2_S4	In addition, as large semiconductor device manufacturers seek to establish closer relationships with their suppliers, we expect that our customer base will become even more concentrated.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Our customers may be unable to pay us for our products and services Our customers include some companies that may from time to time encounter financial difficulties, especially in light of the current economic environment and the turmoil in the credit markets.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	of both our accounts receivable and unbilled services.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The bankruptcy of a customer with a substantial account receivable could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In addition, if a customer declares bankruptcy after paying us certain invoices, a court may determine that we are not properly entitled to that payment and may require repayment of some or all of the amount we received, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our systems may cause fluctuations in our operating results, which could cause our stock price to decline Variations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our revenues and cash flows, and consequen tly, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, to fluctuate widely from period to period.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P3_S4	This variation could cause our stock price to decline.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Our customers generally take a long time to evaluate our inspection and/or film metrology systems and many people are involved in the evaluation process.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P3_S6	We expend significant resources educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our systems in the semiconductor fabrication process.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P3_S7	The length of time it takes for us to make a sale depends upon many factors including, but not limited to:
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	the quality and sophistication of the customer s current metrology and/or inspection equipment.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Because of the number of factors influencing the sales process, the period between our initial contact with a customer and the time when we recognize revenue from that customer and receive payment, if ever, varies widely in length.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our sales cycles, including the time it takes for us to build a product to customer specifications after receiving an order to the time we recognize revenue, typically range from six to 15 months.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Sometimes our sales cycles can be much longer, particularly with customers in Japan.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	During these cycle s, we commit substantial resources to our sales efforts in advance of receiving any revenue, and we may never receive any revenue from a customer despite our sales efforts.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P5_S4	If we do make a sale, our customers often purchase only one of our systems, and then evaluate its performance for a lengthy period before purchasing any more of our systems.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P5_S5	The number of additional products a customer purchases, if any, depends on many factors, including the customer s capacity requirements.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P5_S6	The period between a customer s initial purchase and any subsequent purchases can vary from six months to a year or longer, and variations in the length of this period could cause further fluctuations in our operating results and possibly in our stock price.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Most of our revenues have been derived from customers outside of the United States subjecting us to operati onal, financial and political risks, such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs, political and economic instability, outbreaks of hostilities, and difficulties in managing foreign sales representatives and foreign branch operations Due to the significant level of our international sales, we are subject to a number of material risks, including: Compliance with foreign laws.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our business is subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally, including compliance with, inconsistencies among, and unexpected changes in, a wide variety of foreign laws and regulatory environments with which we are not familiar, including, among other issues, with respect to employees, protection of our intellectual property, and a wide variety of operational regulations and trade and export controls under domestic, foreign, and international law.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including tariffs and other market barriers.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The semiconductor device industry is a high-visibility industry in many of the European and Asian countries in which we sell our products.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Because the governments of these countries have provided extensive financial support to our semiconductor device manufacturing customers in these countries, we believe that our customers could be disproportionately affected by any trade embargoes, excise taxes or other restrictions imposed by their governments on trade with United States companies such as ourselves.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Any restrictions of these types could result in a reduction in our sales to customers in these countries.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We are subject to various global risks related to political and economic instabilities in countries in which we derive sales.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If terrorist activities, armed conflict, civil or military unrest or political instability occurs outside of the U.S., these events may result in reduced demand for our products.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	There is considerable political instability in Taiwan related to its disputes with China and in South Korea related to its disputes with North Korea.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In addition, several Asian countries, particularly Japan, have experienced significant economic instability.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	An outbreak of hosti lities or other political upheaval in China, Taiwan or South Korea, or an economic downturn in Japan or other countries, would likely harm the operations of our customers in these countries.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	South Korea such as Hynix and Samsung, and from semiconductor device manufacturers in Japan such as NEC and Toshiba.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign branch operations.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	During periods of tension between the governments of the United States and certain other countries, it is often difficult for United States companies such as ourselves to staff and manage operations in such countries.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Language and other cultural differences may also inhibit our sales and marketing efforts and create internal communication problems among our U.S. and foreign research and development teams, increasing the difficulty of managing multiple, remote locations performing various development, quali ty assurance, and yield ramp analysis projects.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Currency fluctuations as compared to the U.S. Dollar.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	A substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	As a result, if the dollar rises in value in relation to foreign currencies, our systems will become more expensive to customers outside the United States and less competitive with systems produced by competitors outside the United States.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P12_S3	These conditions could negatively impact our international sales.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Foreign sales also expose us to collection risk in the event it becomes more expensive for our foreign customers to convert their local currencies into U.S. dollars.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Additionally, in the event a larger portion of our revenue becomes denominated in foreign currencies, we would b e subject to a potentially significant exchange rate risk.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P12_S6	If we deliver systems with defects, our credibility will be harmed and the sales and market acceptance of our systems will decrease Our systems are complex and have occasionally contained errors, defects and bugs when introduced.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing or general handling, and can have a major impact on device and process quality.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	When this occurs, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our systems could be harmed.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Further, if our systems contain errors, defects or bugs, we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate these problems.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Defects could also lead to product liability as a result of product liability lawsuits against us or against our customers.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We have agreed to indemnify our customers under certain circumstances against liability arising from defects in our systems.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Our product liability policy currently provides $2.0 million of coverage per claim, with an overall umbrella limit of $14.0 million.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P13_S6	In the event of a successful product liability claim, we could be obligated to pay damages significantly in excess of our product liability insurance limits.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If we are not successful in developing new and enhanced products for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry we will lose market share to our competitors We operate in an industry that is highly competitive and subject to evolving industry standards, rapid technological changes, rapid changes in consumer demands and the rapid introduction of new, higher performance systems with shorter product life cycles.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	To be competitive in our demanding market, we must continually design, develop and introduce in a timely manner new inspection and film metrology systems that meet the performance and price demands of semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We must also continue to refine our current systems so that they remain competitive.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We expect to continue to make significant investments in our research and development activities.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We may experience difficulties or delays in our development efforts with respect to new systems, and we may not ultimately be successful in our product enhancement efforts to improve and advance products or in responding effectively to technological change, as not all research and development activities result in viable commercial products.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P14_S5	In addition, we canno t provide assurance that we will be able to develop new products for the most opportunistic new markets and applications.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Any significant delay in releasing new systems could cause our products to become obsolete, adversely affect our reputation, give a competitor a first-to-market advantage or cause a competitor to achieve greater market share.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P14_S7	In addition, new product offerings that are highly complex in terms of software or hardware may require application or service work such as bug fixing prior to acceptance, thereby delaying revenue recognition.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P14_S8	If new products developed by us do not gain general market acceptance, we will be unable to generate revenues and recover our research and development costs Metrology and inspection product development is inherently risky because it is difficult to foresee developments in semiconductor device manufacturing technology, coordinate technical personnel, and identify and eliminate system design flaws.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P14_S9	Further, our products are complex and often the applications to our customers businesses are unique.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P14_S10	Any new systems we introduce may not achieve or sustain a significant degree of market acceptance and sales.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P14_S11	We expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources developing new systems and refining our existing systems.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P14_S12	In light of the long product development cycles inherent in our industry, these expenditures will be made well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenue from the sale of those systems.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P14_S13	Our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market new systems are su bject to a wide variety of challenges during the development cycle, including start-up bugs, design defects, and other matters that could delay introduction of these systems.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P14_S14	In addition, since our customers are not obligated by long-term contracts to purchase our systems, our anticipated product orders may not materialize, or orders that are placed may be cancelled.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Even if we are able to develop new products that gain market acceptance, sales of these new products could impair our ability to sell existing products Competition from our new systems could have a negative effect on sales of our existing systems and the prices that we could charge for these systems.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We may also divert sales and marketing resources from our current systems in order to successfully launch and promote our new or next generation systems.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Th is diversion of resources could have a further negative effect on sales of our current systems and the value of inventory.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If our relationships with our large customers deteriorate, our product development activities could be adversely affected The success of our product development efforts depends on our ability to anticipate market trends and the price, performance and functionality requirements of semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In order to anticipate these trends and ensure that critical development projects proceed in a coordinated manner, we must continue to collaborate closely with our largest customers.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Our relationships with these and other customers provide us with access to valu able information regarding trends in the semiconductor device industry, which enables us to better plan our product development activities.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P15_S6	If our current relationships with our large customers are impaired, or if we are unable to develop similar collaborative relationships with important customers in the future, our product development activities could be adversely affected.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Our ability to reduce costs is limited by our ongoing need to invest in research and development and to provide customer support activities Our industry is characterized by the need for continual investment in research and development as well as customer service and support.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P15_S8	As a result, our operating results could be mat erially affected if operating costs associated with our research and development as well as customer support activities increase in the future or we are unable to reduce those activities.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P15_S9	We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property and, therefore, lose our competitive advantage Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology for our principal product families, and we rely, in part, on patent and trade secret law and confidentiality agreements to protect that technology.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P15_S10	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it will give our competitors a significant advantage.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P15_S11	We own or have licensed a number of patents relating to our transparent and opaque thin film metrology and macro-defect inspection systems, and have filed applications for additional patents.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P15_S12	Any of our pending patent applications may be rejected, and we may be unable to develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable in the future.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P15_S13	In addition, the patents that we do own or that have been issued or licensed to us may not provide us with competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P15_S14	Further, third parties may also design around these patents.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In addition to patent protection, we rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and technology.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and other third parties.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Even though these agreements are in place there can be no assurances that t rade secrets and proprietary information will not be disclosed, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, or that we can fully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Violations by others of our confidentiality agreements and the loss of employees who have specialized knowledge and expertise could harm our competitive position and cause our sales and operating results to decline as a result of increased competition.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Costly and time-consuming litigation might be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection might adversely affect our ability to continue our research or bring products to market.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Protection of our intellectual property rights, or the efforts of third parties to enforce their own intellectual property rights against us, may result in costly and time-consuming litigation, substantial damages, lost product sales and/or the loss of important intellectual property rights We may be required to initiate litigation in order to enforce any patents issued to or licensed by us, or to determine the scope or validity of a third party s patent or other proprietary rights.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Any litigation, regardless of outcome, could be expensive and time consuming, and could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to re-engineer our products or obtain expensive licenses from third parties.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P16_S7	There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advant age.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P16_S8	In addition, our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P16_S9	From time to time, we may receive communications from third parties asserting that our products or systems infringe, or may infringe, the proprietary rights of these third parties.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	to protracted and costly litigation, which could require us to pay substantial damages or have the sale of our products or systems stopped by an injunction.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Infringement claims could also cause product or system delays or require us to redesign our products or systems, and these delays could result in the loss of substantial revenues.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We may also be required to obtain a license from the third party or cease activities utilizing the third party s proprietary rights.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We may not be able to enter into such a license or such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Accordingly, the loss of important intellectual property rights could hinder our ability to sell our systems, or make the sale of these systems more expensive.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in certain foreign countries, where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the United States The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement abroad.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S6	For example, Taiwan is not a signatory of the Patent Cooperation Treaty, which is designed to specify rules and methods for defending intellectual property internationally.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S7	The publication of a patent in Taiwan prior to the filing of a patent in Taiwan would invalidate the ability of a company to obtain a patent in Taiwan.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Similarly, in contrast to the United S tates where the contents of patents remain confidential during the patent application process, in Taiwan the contents of a patent are published upon filing which provides competitors an advance view of the contents of a patent application prior to the establishment of patent rights.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S9	Consequently, there is a risk that we may be unable to adequately protect its proprietary rights in certain foreign countries.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S10	If this occurs, it would be easier for our competitors to develop and sell competing products in these countries.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S11	Some of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, and increased competition could impair sales of our products or cause us to reduce our prices The market for semiconductor capital equipment is highly competitive.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S12	We face substantial competition from established companies in each of the markets we serve.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S13	We principally compete with KLA-Tencor and Camtek.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S14	We compete to a lesser extent with companies such as Nanometrics, Vistec and Nikon.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S15	Each of our products also competes with products that use different metrology or inspection techniques.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S16	Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, broader product offerings and service capabilities and larger installed customer bases than we do.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S17	As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or market developments by devoting greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products, which, in turn, could impair sales of our products.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S18	Further, there may be significant merger and acquisition activity among our competitors and potential competitors, which, in turn, may provide them with a competitive advantage over us by enabling them to rapidly expand their product offerings and service capabilities to meet a broader range of customer needs.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Many of our customers and potential customers in the semiconductor device manufacturing industry are large companies that require global support and service for their semiconductor capital equipment.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We believe that our global support and service infrastructure is sufficient to meet the needs of our customers and potential customers.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	However, some of our competitors have more extensive infrastructures than we do, which could place us at a disadvantage when competing for the business of global semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Many of our competitors are investing heavily in the development of new systems that will compete directly with our systems.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P18_S4	We have from time to time selectively reduced p rices on our systems in order to protect our market share, and competitive pressures may necessitate further price reductions.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P18_S5	We expect our competitors in each product area to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices and performance characteristics.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P18_S6	These product introductions would likely require us to decrease the prices of our systems and increase the level of discounts that we grant our customers.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Price reductions or lost sales as a result of these competitive pressures would reduce our total revenues and could adversely impact our financial results.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We believe that once a semiconductor device manufacturer has selected one vendor s capital equipment for a production-line application, the manufacturer generally relies upon that capital equipment and, to the extent possible, subsequent generations of the same vendor s equipment, for the life of the application.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Once a vendor s equipment has been installed in a production line application, a semiconductor device manufacturer must often make substantial technical modifications and may experience production-line downtime in order to switch to another vendor s equipment.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Accordingly, unless our systems offer performance or cost advantages that outweigh a customer s expense of switching to our systems, it will be difficult for us to achieve significant sales to that customer once it has selected another vendor s capital equipment for an application.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	and marketing, customer support, finance and manufacturing personnel.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The loss of any of these key personnel, each of whom would be extremely difficult to replace, could harm our business and operating results.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Although we have employment and noncompetition agreements with key members of our senior management team, including Messrs. McLaughlin and Roth, these individuals or other key employees may still leave us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We do not have key person life insurance on any of our executives.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In addition, to support our future growth, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Competition for such personnel in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attrac ting and retaining qualified employees.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P20_S6	We obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a limited group of suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenues We obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a limited group of suppliers and do not have long-term contracts with many of our suppliers.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P20_S7	Our dependence on limited source suppliers of components and our lack of long-term contracts with many of our suppliers exposes us to several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components, price increases, late deliveri es and poor component quality.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our systems, damage our customer relationships and reduce our sales.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	From time to time in the past, we have experienced temporary difficulties in receiving shipments from our suppliers.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The lead-time required for shipments of some of our components can be as long as four months.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, the lead time required to qualify new suppliers for lasers could be as long as a year, and the lead time required to qualify new suppliers of other components could be as long as nine months.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	If we are unable to accurately predict our component needs, or if our component supply is disrupted, we may miss market opportunities by not being able to meet the demand for our systems.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Further, a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components or subassemblies could seriously harm our results of operations and cash flows.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility could have a material adverse effect on our revenues Our manufacturing processes are highly complex and require sophisticated and costly equipment and a specially designed facility.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P22_S3	As a result, any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, or destruction of or damage as a result of a fire or any other reason, could seriously harm our ability to satisfy our customer order deadlines.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P22_S4	If we cannot timely deliver our systems, our results from operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Our earnings could be negatively affected and our inventory levels could materially increase if we are unable to predict our inventory needs in an accurate and timely manner and adjust our orders for parts and subcomponents should our needs increase or decrease materially due to unexpected increases or decreases in demand for our products.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Any material increase in our inventories could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, while any material decrease in our ability to procure needed inventories could result in an inability to supply customer demand for our products thus adversely affecting our revenues.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Our ability to fulfill our backlog may have an effect on our long term ability to procure contracts and fulfill current contracts Our ability to fulfill our backlog may be limited by our ability to devote sufficient financial and human capital resources and limited by available material supplies.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P22_S8	If we do not fulfill our backlog in a timely manner, we may experience delays in product delivery which would postpone receipt of revenue from those delayed deliveries.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P22_S9	Additionally, if we are consistently unable to fulfill our backlog, this may be a disincentive to customers to award large contracts to us in the future until they are comfortable that we can effectively manage our backlog.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P22_S10	We may choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves, and may be unable to complete these acquisitions or may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired business in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner Our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P22_S11	To this end, we have, from time to time, engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P22_S12	We may cho ose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products, technologies and/or services instead of developing them ourselves.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P22_S13	We may, however, face competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established companies with greater financial resources, making it more difficult for us to complete acquisitions.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Integrating any business, product technology or service we acquire could be expensive and time-consuming and/or disrupt our ongoing business.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Further, there are numerous risks associated therewith, including but not limited to:
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	unexpected reduction of sales of existing products by new products.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such favorable terms or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations, including as a result of our incurrence of indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In order to finance any acquisitions, we might need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In that event, we could be forced to obtain financing on terms that are not favorable to us and, in the case of equity financing, that result in dilution to our stockholders.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In addition, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, amortization of intangible assets, write-down of other assets or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions and purchase accounting could harm our business and operating results.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P25_S3	If we cannot effectively manage our growth, our business may suffer Over the long-term we intend to continue to grow by increasing our sales efforts and completing strategic acquisitions.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P25_S4	To effectively manage our growth, we must, among other things:
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	administer appropriate financial and administrative control procedures.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our anticipated growth will likely place a significant strain on our management, financial, operational, technical, sales and administrative resources.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Any failure to effectively manage our growth may cause our business to suffer and our stock price to decline.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Changes in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect results As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Our future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the (1) applicable tax laws; (2) composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates; or (3) valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P27_S3	In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P27_S4	We r egularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Turmoil in the credit markets and the financial services industry may negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity The credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a perio d of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy, failure, collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States federal government.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	While the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted, they may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition if our ability to obtain credit from trade creditors were to be impaired.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In addition, the economic crisis could also adversely impact our customers ability to finance the purchase of systems from us or our suppliers ability to provide us with product, either of which may negatively impact our business and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our operating results are subject to significant variation due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor device industry.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our business depends upon the capital expenditure s of semiconductor device manufacturers, which, in turn, depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	This cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and, thus, future expense levels.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S3	During a down cycle, we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S4	In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S5	We can provide no assurance that these objectives c an be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S6	If we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business could be seriously harmed.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S7	Our future rate of growth is highly dependent on the development and growth of the market for microelectronic device inspection and metrology equipment We target our products to address the needs of microelectronic device manufacturers for defect inspection and metrology.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S8	If for any reason the market for microelectronic device inspection or metrology equipment fails to grow in the long term, we may be unable to maintain current revenue levels in the short term and maintain our historical growth in the long term.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S9	Growth in the inspection market is depend ent to a large extent upon microelectronic manufacturers replacing manual inspection with automated inspection technology.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S10	Growth in the metrology market is dependent to a large extent upon new chip designs and capacity expansion of microelectronic manufacturers.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S11	There is no assurance that manufacturers will undertake these actions at the rate we expect.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S12	Risks Related to our Stock Provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law, as well as our stockholder rights plan, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and/or delay, deter or prevent a change in control of our company Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as our stockholder rights plan, may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board of Directors.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S13	These provisions also limit the circumstances in which a premium can be paid for the common stock, and in which a proxy contest for control of our board may be initiated.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	the authority of our board, without stockholder approval, to adopt a Stockholder Rights Plan.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Such a Shareholder Rights Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on June 27, 2005.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We are also entitled to avail ourselves of the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could inhibit changes in control of us.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our stock price is volatile The market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely.

1094392_11_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or incre ase the value of an investment in our common stock.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Factors affecting our stock price may include:
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	the number of firms making a market in our common stock.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	In addition, the stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P33_S2	These fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high technology companies like ours.
1094392_11_ITEM1A_P33_S3	These market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1094392_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our ex ecutive office building is located at One Rudolph Road in Flanders, New Jersey.
1094392_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own and lease facilities for engineering, sales and service related purposes in the United States and six other countries China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Scotland.

1094392_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview We are a worldwide leader in the design, development, manufacture and support of high-performance defect inspection, process control metrology and data analysis systems used by semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	We provide yield management solutions used in both wafer processing and final manufacturing through a family of standalone systems for both macro-defect inspection and transparent and opaque thin film measurements.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P0_S2	All of these systems feature production-worthy automation and are backed by worldwide customer support.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	On January 22, 2008, we anno unced that we had acquired all intellectual property and selected assets from privately-held RVSI Inspection, LLC, headquartered in Hauppauge, New York.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	The acquired business is currently known as the Rudolph Technologies Wafer Scanner Product Group ( WSPG ) and has been integrated into our Inspection product offerings.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	On August 3, 2009, we announced that we had acquired Adventa Control Technologies, Inc. ( Adventa ), headquartered in Plano, Texas.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	The acquired business is currently known as the Rudolph Technologies Process Control Group ( PCG ) and has been integrated into our Data Analysis and Review group product offerings On August 11, 2010, we ann ounce that we had acquired selected assets of the Yield Dynamics software business from MKS Instruments, headquartered in Andover, Massachusetts.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	The acquired business has been integrated into our Data Analysis and Review group product offerings.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Rudolph s business is affected by the annual spending patterns of our customers on semiconductor capital equipment.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	The amount that our customers devote to capital equipment spending depends on a number of factors, including general worldwide economic conditions as well as other economic drivers such as personal computer, cell phone and personal electronic device sales.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	Current forecasts by industry analysts for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry similar year-over-year capital spending plus or minus 5% for 2011 .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	We monitor capital equipment spending through announced capital spending plans by our customers and monthly-published industry data such as the book-to-bill ratio.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	The book-to-bill ratio is a 3-month running statistic that compares bookings or orders placed with capital equipment suppliers to billings or shipments.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	A book-to-bill ratio above 1.0 shows that semiconductor device equipment manufacturers are ordering equipment at a pace that exceeds the equipment suppliers shipments for the period.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P4_S3	The three month rolling average North American semiconductor equipment book-to-bill ratio was 0.9 for the month of December 2010 , decreasing from the September 2010 book-to-bill ratio of 1.0.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Historically, a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers, and we expect this trend to continue.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , sales to customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for 36.3%, 44.8%, and 44.4% of our revenues , respectively.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009 , sales to Intel Corporation accounted for 10.9% and 13.6% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	In 2010, sales to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Semiconductor, Inc. accounted for 13.9% and 11.2% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P5_S4	We do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products, and they could cease purchasing products from us at any time.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P5_S5	A delay in purchase or cancellation by any of our large customers could cause quarterly revenues to vary significantly.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P5_S6	In addition, during a given quarter, a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P5_S7	Our macro-defect inspection and probe card and test analysis systems range in average selling price from approximately $250,000 to $1.6 million per system, our transparent film measurement systems range in average selling price from approximately $250,000 to $1.0 million per system and our opaque film measurement systems range in average selling price from approximately $1.0 million to $2.0 million per system.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	A significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customers outside of the United States.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	In 2008 , approximately 76.5% of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the United States, of which 57.0% were derived from customers in Asia and 19.5% were derived from customers in Europe.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	In 2009 , approximately 72.4% of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the United States, of which 60.8% were derived from customers in Asia and 11.6% were derived from customers in Europe.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P6_S3	In 2010 , approximately 76.8% of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the United States, of which 65.7% were derived from customers in Asia and 11.1% were derived from customers in Europe.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P6_S4	We expect that revenues generated from customers outside of the United States will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P6_S5	The sales cycle for our systems typically ranges from nine to 15 months, and can be longer when our customers are evaluating new technology.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P6_S6	Due to the length of these cycles, we invest significantly in research and development and sales and marketing in advance of generating revenues related to these investments.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our statements of operations data as percentages of our revenues.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our results of operations are reported as one business segment.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	Results of Operations 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Revenues.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our revenues are derived from the sale of our systems, services, spare parts and software licensing.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	Our revenues were $131.0 million , $78.7 million and $195.3 million in the years ended 2008 , 2009 and 2010 .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P9_S3	This represents a decrease of 40.0% from 2008 to 2009 and a increase of 148.3% from 2009 to 2010 .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P9_S4	The decrease in revenue from 2008 to 2009 is primarily due to weakness in the overall semiconductor equipment manufacturing sector.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P9_S5	The increase in revenue from 2009 to 2010 is primarily due to improving economic conditions leading to increased capital spending in the semiconductor industry.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P9_S6	The following table lists, for the periods indicated, the different sources of our revenues in dollars (thousands) and as percentages of our total revenues:
1094392_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Systems revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 due to the decrease in the number of inspection and metrology systems sold during this period.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	These changes in systems revenue reflect a decrease in inspection systems revenue of $35.4 million and a decrease in metrology systems revenue of $12.2 million from 2008 to 2009.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	The average selling price of similarly configured systems has been consistent and therefore did not have a material impact on our revenue for the same period.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	The year-over-year increase in data analysis and review software revenues of $2.3 million from 2008 to 2009 is primarily due to revenue from PCG, which is part of our Data Analysis and Review products, and which was acquired in the third quarter of 2009.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	Systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to 40% of total revenue for 2008 compared to 35% of total revenue for 2009 .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	The year-over-year decrease in parts and service revenues in absolute dollars from 2008 to 2009 is primarily due to overall weakness in the semiconductor market during 2009.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	Parts and services revenues are generated from part sales, maintenance service contracts, system upgrades, as well as time and material billable service calls.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Systems revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 due to improving economic conditions leading to increased capital spending in the semiconductor industry.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	This contributed to an increase in the number of systems sold from 2009 to 2010.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	These changes in systems revenue reflect an increase in inspection systems revenue of $67.9 million and an increase in metrology systems revenue of $30.5 million .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P12_S3	The average selling price of similarly configured systems has been consistent and therefore did not have a material impact on our revenue for the same period.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	The year-over-year increase in data analysis and review software revenues of $12.7 million from 2009 to 2010 is primarily due to revenue from PCG.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	Systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to 35% of total revenue for 2 009 compared to 59% of total revenue for 2010 .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	The year-over-year increase in parts and service revenues in absolute dollars from 2009 to 2010 is primarily due to increased spending by our customers on repairs of existing systems.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P13_S3	Parts and services revenues are generated from part sales, maintenance service contracts, system upgrades, as well as time and material billable service calls.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P13_S4	Deferred revenues of $8.7 million at December 31, 2010 primarily consist of $4.1 million for deferred maintenance agreements and $4.6 million for systems awaiting acceptance and outstanding deliverables.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P13_S5	Our gross profit has been and is anticipated to be affected by a variety of factors, including inventory step-up from purchase accounting, manufacturing efficiencies, excess and obsolete inventory write-offs, pricing by competitors or suppliers, new product introductions, production volume, customization and reconfiguration of systems, international and dome stic sales mix, and parts and service margins.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P13_S6	Our gross profit was $43.7 million , $28.9 million and $103.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , respectively.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P13_S7	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from 2008 to 2009 is primarily due to an inventory write down of $4.8 million in 2009 which had less of an impact on gross profit than the inventory write down of $14.1 million in 2008.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P13_S8	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from 2009 to 2010 is primarily due to higher revenues, including an i ncrease in software sales, higher average selling prices and lower reserves due to better inventory utilization.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	We do not track gross margin by the sources of revenue.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	The macro-defect inspection, thin film transparent, opaque process control, and probe card test analysis market is characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	We believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products, including the transition to copper and low-k dielectrics, wafer level packaging, the continuous shrinkage in critical dimensions, and the evolution of ultra-thin gate process control, is critical to our success.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our technical, management and financial resources to research and development programs.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P15_S3	Research and development expenditures consist primarily of salaries and related expenses of employees engaged in research, design and development activities .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P15_S4	They also include consulting fees and the cost of related supplies.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P15_S5	Our research and development expense was $31.6 million , $26.0 million and $33.4 million in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , respectively.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P15_S6	The year-over-year dollar decrease from 2008 to 2009 primarily reflects reduced compensation costs and lower project costs as part of cost reduction efforts, partially offset by an increase in litigation expenses and the inclusion of expenses related to the activities of the acquisition of PCG in the 2009 period.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P15_S7	The year-over-year dollar increase from 2009 to 2010 is primarily due to higher costs related to compensation, projects and litigation, as well as, the inclusion of engineering costs associated with the YDI acquisition in the third quarter of 2010.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	We continue to maintain our commitment to investing in new product development and enhancement to existing products in order to position ourselves for future growth.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs for sales, marketing, and general administrative personnel, as well as commissions and other non-personnel related expenses.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	Our selling, general and administrative expense was $36.5 million , $32.7 mi llion and $38.2 million in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , respectively.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	The year-over-year dollar decrease from 2008 to 2009 in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily due to the elimination of administrative costs associated with prior business combinations, and lower compensation costs in the 2009 period, offset by expenses as a result of the Adventa acquisi tion and manufacturing consolidation costs.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P17_S3	The year-over-year increase in selling, general and administrative expense from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to higher compensation and corporate litigation expenses in the 2010 period.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Impairment Charge for Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	Impairment charge for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets was $227.1 million for 2008 and $0 for both 2009 and 2010 .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P18_S3	As of October 31, 2010 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and determined that the fair value was not less than carrying value; therefore, there was no impairment of goodwill.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	During our annual goodwill impairment test in October 2008, we experienced a significant decline in our stock price.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	In performing the goodwill impairment test, we used current market capitalization, control premiums, discounted cash flows and other factors as the best evidence of fair value.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	The impairment test resulted in no value att ributable to our goodwill and accordingly, we wrote off all of our $192.9 million of goodwill as of October 31, 2008.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	In connection with the goodwill impairment test, we determined that our identifiable acquired intangible assets were impaired.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P20_S3	The determination was based on the carrying values exceeding the future undiscounted cash flows and fair value attributable to such intangible assets.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P20_S4	As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $34.2 million as of October 31, 2008, which represents the difference between the estimated fair values of these long-lived assets as compared to their carrying values.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P20_S5	Fair values were determined based upon market conditions, the relief from royalty approach which utilized cash flow projections, and other factors.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P20_S6	In 2008, other income totaled $2.5 million .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P20_S7	Other expense was $0.9 million and $0.3 million in 2009 and 2010 , respectively.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P20_S8	The year-over-year dollar changes in other income (expense) were primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P20_S9	Interest income was $1.2 million, $0.3 million, and $0.2 million in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P20_S10	The year-over-year dollar changes in interest income is primarily due to lower average interest rates.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P20_S11	We recorded income tax benefit of $4 .1 million and $2.2 million , respectively, in 2008 and 2009 .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P20_S12	Income tax expense was $3.5 million in 2010 .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P20_S13	The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $4.1 million or 1.6% of loss before benefit for income taxes.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P20_S14	The income tax benefit differs from the amount that would result from applying the federal statutory income tax rate of 35% to our loss before benefit for income taxes, primarily due to our inability to record a full income tax benefit for the impairments of the goodwill and long-lived assets and valuation allowances in taxable jurisdictions.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P20_S15	The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $2.2 million or 7.0% of loss before benefit for income taxes.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P20_S16	The income tax benefit differs from the amount that would result from applying the federal statutory income tax rate of 35% to our loss before benefit for income taxes, primarily due to valuation allowances in taxable jurisdictions.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P20_S17	Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $3.5 million or 11.5% of income before provision for income taxes.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P20_S18	This differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 35%, primarily as a result of projected tax payments in U.S. and foreign locations, offset by valuation allowances.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	We evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets from future taxable income and establish valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	We consider available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	As a result of our analysis, we concluded that it is more likely than not that substantially all of our net deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P21_S3	Therefore, we continue to provide a valuation allowance against these net deferred tax assets.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P21_S4	A portion of our net deferred tax assets relate to R D credits which are reserved for in our FASB ASC 740 provision.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P21_S5	We closely monitor available evidence, and may reverse some or all of the valuation allowance in future periods, if appropriate.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P21_S6	The valuation allowance increased $6.8 million in 2009 and decreased $6.0 million in 2010 , respectively.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Liquidit y and Capital Resources At December 31, 2009 , we had $60.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $126.8 million in working capital.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	At December 31, 2010 , our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $71.7 million , while working capital amounted to $159.7 million .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Typically during periods of revenue growth, changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a use of cash as we incur costs and expend cash in advance of receiving cash from our customers.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	Similarly, during periods of declining revenue, changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a source of cash as inventory purchases decline and revenue from prior periods is collected.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	However, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as our revenues declined our change in inventories represented a use of ca sh.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	This was primarily due to increasing inventory related to new products and the acceleration of the slowdown in the semiconductor industry.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P23_S4	Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2009, as our revenue declined from $131.0 million to $78.7 million , our change in accounts receivables represented a use of cash.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P23_S5	This was primarily due to increasing sales in the fourth quarter of 2009, offset by significantly lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2008.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P23_S6	Net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2010 totaled $15.4 million and $16.3 million , respectively.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P23_S7	Net cash and cash equivalents used by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $12.1 million .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	million , an increase in inventories of $4.3 million , a decrease in accrued liabilities of $2.5 million and a decrease in deferred revenue of $1.6 million .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2009 , cash used by operating activities was primarily due to net loss, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, of $11.7 million , an increase in accounts receivable of $13.2 million , a decrease in other current liabilities of $1.3 million and a decrease in accrued liabilities of $1.2 million , partially offset by a decrease in inventories of $6.9 million , an increase in accounts payable of $3.2 million , an increase in non-current liabilities of $2.0 million , an increase in deferred revenue of $1.6 million and a decrease in income taxes receivable $1.0 million .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2010 , cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, of $37.1 million , an increase in accrued liabilities of $2.7 million , a decrease in income tax receivable of $2.3 million , an increase in accounts payable of $2.2 million , an increase in deferred revenue of $0.9 million , and increase in other current liabilities of $0.8 million , partially offset by an increase of accounts receivable of $24.1 million and an increase of inventories of $5.6 million .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2010 totaled $5.7 million and $2.8 million , respectively.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	The net cash and cash equivalents provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 total ed $1.7 million .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2008 , net cash used by investing activities included purchases of marketable securities of $15.5 million , acquisition costs for business combinations of $8.5 million , capital expenditures of $3.0 million , partially offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $21.3 million .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P25_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2009 , net cash provided by investing activities included proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $19.4 million , partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $12.2 million , acquisition costs for a business combination of $5.0 million and purchase of property, plant and equipment of $0.6 million .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P25_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2010 , net cash used by investing activities included purchases of marketable securities of $7.8 million , capital expenditures of $4.4 million , acquisition costs for business combinations of $0.8 million , partially offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $10.3 million .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P25_S5	Capital expenditures over the next twelve months are expected to be approximately $3.0 million to $5.0 million.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P25_S6	Net cash provided by financing activities was $0.2 million , $0.2 million and $0.5 million in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , respectively.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P25_S7	In the 2008 and 2009 periods, net cash provided by financing activities was a result of proceeds received from sales of shares through share-based compensation plans.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P25_S8	In the 2010 period, net cash provided by financing activities comprised proceeds received from sales of shares through share-based compensation plans of $0.3 million and tax benefit from share-based compensation plans of $0 .2 million From time to time we evaluate whether to acquire new or complementary businesses, products and/or technologies.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P25_S9	We may fund all or a portion of the purchase price of these acquisitions in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to 3 million shares of Company common stock.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	As of the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not purchased any shares under this program.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	Our future capital requirements will depend on m any factors, including the timing and amount of our revenues and our investment decisions, which will affect our ability to generate additional cash.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P26_S3	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for the next twelve months.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P26_S4	Thereafter, if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements, we may seek additional funding through bank borrowings, sales of securities or other means.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P26_S5	There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us or at all.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2010 , and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	This table excludes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits that totaled approximately $6.7 million at December 31, 2010 .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	We are currently unable to provide a reaso nably reliable estimate of the amount or periods when cash settlement of this liability may occur.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Company does not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity and capital resources.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Critical Accounting Policies Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	We review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P29_S3	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, business acquisitions, intangible assets, share-based payments, income taxes and warranty obligations.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P29_S4	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of asse ts and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P29_S5	Results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P29_S6	These estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis, and by the Audit Committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P29_S7	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Certai n sales of our products are sold and accounted for as multiple element arrangements, consisting primarily of the sale of the product, software, installation and training services.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	We generally recognize product revenue upon shipment.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	In the limited circumstances where customer acceptance is subjective and not obtained prior to shipment, we defer product revenue until such time as positive affirmation of acceptance has been obtained from the customer.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P31_S3	Customer acceptance is generally based on our products meeting published performance specifications.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P31_S4	The amount of revenue allocated to the shipment of products is done on a residual method basis.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P31_S5	Under this method, the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered contract elements, based on their fair values, with the remainder being allocated to product revenue.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	The fair value of installation and training services is based upon billable hourly rates and the estimated time to complete the service.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	Revenue related to undelivered installation service s is deferred until such time as installation is completed at the customer s site.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	Revenue related to training services is recognized ratably over the training period.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P32_S3	Revenue from software license fees is recognized upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and vendor-specific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P32_S4	Such undelivered elements in these arrangements typically consist of follow-on support.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P32_S5	If vendor-specific objective evidence does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement, all revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the support period.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	We maintain allowances for do ubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	We specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if our assumptions are otherwise incorrect, additional allowances may be required.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	We write down our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about f uture product life-cycles, product demand and market conditions.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	If actual product life-cycles, product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	We account for acquired or merged businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition or merger at their respective fair values.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	Accordingly, for significant acquisitions, we typically obtain assistance from independent valuation specialists.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	There are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	For intangible assets, we normally utilize the income method.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the projected future cash flows (including timing) and the discount rate reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flows.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	For example, different types of intangible assets will h ave different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	All of these judgments and estimates can significantly impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	an event occurs or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process which requires us to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	The first step consists of estimating the fair value of our aggregated reporting unit using the market value of our common stock at October 31st, multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares (market capitalization) and an implied control premium as if it were to be acquired by a single stockholder.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	We obtain information on completed sales of similar companies in a comparable industry to estimate an implied control premium for us.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	We compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value which includes goodw ill.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	If the results of the initial market capitalization test produce results which are below the reporting unit carrying value, we will also consider if the market capitalization is temporarily low and, if so, we may also perform a discounted cash flow test.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the second step is completed to compute the impairment amount by determining the implied fair value of goodwill.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	This determination requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	Any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill which is compared to the corresponding carrying value to compute the goodwill impairment amount.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Long-Lived Assets and Acquired Intangible Assets.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	We periodically review long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and the impairment of such long-lived assets, if any, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	No such indicators were noted in 2010.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	The fair value of our stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	The Black-Scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility, expected terms, risk-free rates and dividend yield.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	We use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	The expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options, and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	We have never paid cash dividends, and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends, and thus have assumed a 0% dividend yield.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	If our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share-based compensation cost, or if different assumptions had been used, we may have recorded too much or too little share-based compensation cost.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our share grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P50_S3	If the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	While we engage in product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P52_S3	Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P52_S4	The need for a valuation allowance is bas ed on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred taxes will be recoverable.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P52_S5	In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, we may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P52_S6	At December 31, 2010 , we had a valuation allowance of $37.2 million on most of our deferred tax assets to reflect the deferred tax asset at the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	The first step requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that the tax position has met the threshold for recognition; therefore, we must evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	The second step requires us to measure the tax benefit of the tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized when effectively settled.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P53_S3	This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P53_S4	We reevaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues, and new audit activity.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P53_S5	Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period .
1094392_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, it could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance related to Business Combinations.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	The amendments affect any public entity that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	The amendments specify that if a publi c entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	The amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P55_S4	The amendments are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P55_S5	We will assess the impact of these amendments on our consolidated financial position and results of operations if and when an acquisition occurs.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance related to Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	The amendments modify Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	In determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	The qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance and examples, which require that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	For public entities, the amendments a re effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	We do not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	ASU No. 2010-20 requires increased disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and allowances for credit losses, including disclosure about credit quality indicators, past due information and modifications of finance receivables.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	The guidance is generally effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2010.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	The adoption of ASU No. 2010-20 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financi al position and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-17, "Revenue Recognition- Milestone Method (Topic 605)," which provides guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	This ASU is effective in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P61_S2	We do not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2010-17 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-13, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)," which provides guidance on the classification of a share-based payment award as either equity or a liability.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	A share-based payment award that contains a condition that is not a market, performance, or service condition is required to be classified as a liability.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2010.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	We do not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2010-13 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	The objective of this ASU was to remove the requirement for an SEC filer to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in both issued and revised financial statements.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	This ASU is to be ap plied immediately upon issuance.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	We have adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2010 and the adoption of this ASU did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P64_S3	This ASU requires new disclosures regarding significant transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2, and information about activity in Level 3 fair value measurements.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P64_S4	In addition, this ASU clarifies existing disclosures regarding input and valuation techniques, as well as the level of disaggregation for each class of assets and liabilities.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P64_S5	This ASU was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for certain Level 3 activity d isclosure requirements, which are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P64_S6	We adopted the new guidance in the first quarter of 2010, except for the disclosures related to purchases, sales, issuance and settlements, which will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2011.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P64_S7	Because these new standards are related primarily to disclosures, their adoption has not had and is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	No. 2009-14 on FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 985, Software Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements-a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	The objective of this ASU is to clarify which revenue allocation and measurement guidance should be used for arrangements that contain both tangible products and software, in cases where the software is more than incidental to the tangible product as a whole.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	More specifically, if the software sold with or embedded within the tangible product is essential to the functionalit y of the tangible product, then this software as well as undelivered software elements that relate to this software are excluded from the scope of existing software revenue guidance, which is expected to decrease the amount of revenue deferred in these cases.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	This ASU is to be applied prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, which for us is the year 2011.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	Early adoption is permitted, but this ASU must be adopted in the same period as, and use the same transition method that is used for, the ASU described in the following paragraph.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	We do not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2009-14 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13 on FASB ASC 605, Revenue Rec ognition Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	The objective of this ASU is to address the accounting for multiple-deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services (deliverables) separately rather than as a combined unit.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	Vendors often provide multiple products or services to their customers.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	Those deliverables are often provided at different points in time or over different time periods.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	This ASU provides amendments to the criteria in FASB ASC 605-25 for separating consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P69_S3	The amendments in this ASU establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P69_S4	The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available, third-party evidence if vendor-specific objective evidence is not available, or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third-party evid ence is available.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P69_S5	The amendments in this ASU also will replace the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity-specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P69_S6	This update is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
1094392_11_ITEM7_P69_S7	We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of this new accounting update on our consolidated financial statements.
1094392_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates and market liquidity primarily from our investments in certain available-for-sale securities.
1094392_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our available-for-sale securities consist of fixed and variable rate income investments (U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, auction rate securities and corporate bonds).
1094392_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates, market liquidity and credit ratings of issuers from our available-for-sale securities.
1094392_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	It is possible that we are at risk if interest rates, market liquidity or credit ratings of issuers change in an unfavorable direction.
1094392_11_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The magnitude of any gain or loss will be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations cou ld be materially affected.
1094392_11_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our financial investments held as of December 31, 2010 , an immediate adverse change of 10% in interest rates (e.g. 3.00% to 3.30%) would result in an immaterial decrease in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities.
1094392_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Foreign Currency Risk We have branch operations in Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea and wholly-owned subsidiaries in Europe, Japan and China.
1094392_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our international subsidiaries and branches operate primarily using local functional currencies.
1094392_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	These for eign branches and subsidiaries are limited in their operations and level of investment so that the risk of currency fluctuations is not material.
1094392_11_ITEM7A_P1_S3	A hypothetical 10% appreciation or depreciation in the U.S. dollar relative to the reporting currencies of our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 would have affected the foreign-currency-denominated non-operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries by approximately $0.9 million.
1094392_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1094392_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	A substantial portion of our international systems sales are denominated in U.S. dollars with the exception of Japan and, as a result, we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these sales.
1094392_11_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Substantially all our sales in Japan are denominated in Japanese yen.
1094392_11_ITEM7A_P2_S3	From time to time, we may enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of, but n ot all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within 12 months.
1094392_11_ITEM7A_P2_S4	The change in fair value of the forward contracts is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations each reporting period.
1094392_11_ITEM7A_P2_S5	As of December 31, 2009 and 2010 , we had four and twenty forward contracts outstanding, respectively.
1094392_11_ITEM7A_P2_S6	The total notional contract value of these outstanding forward contracts at December 31, 2009 and 2010 was $1.0 million and $2.2 million, respectively.
1094392_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1094392_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	The consolidated financial statements required by this item are set forth on the pages indicated at Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1094392_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in SEC rules and forms.
1094392_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	These controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1094392_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, we have recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving th e desired control objectives.
1094392_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management is required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures.
1094392_11_ITEM9A_P1_S2	We performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, to assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2010 .
1094392_11_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Based on that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2010 at the reasonable assurance level.
1094392_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishin g and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
1094392_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1094392_11_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1094392_11_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on our evaluation, our manageme nt concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010 .
1094392_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1094392_11_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1094392_11_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 have been audited by Ernst Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1094392_11_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Ernst Young LLP has also audited our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 , as stated in its attestation report included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Ex change Act) that occurred during the Company s quarter ended December 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

1094392_11_ITEM15_P54_S2	For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not t hat a goodwill impairment exists.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P55_S0	In determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P55_S1	The qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance and examples, which require that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	For public entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P56_S1	The Company does not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	ASU No. 2010-20 requires increased disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and allowances for credit losses, including disclosure about credit quality indicators, past due information and modifications of finance receivables.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P57_S1	The guidance is generally effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2010.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P58_S0	The adoption of ASU No. 2010-20 did not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P58_S1	In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-17, "Revenue Recognition- Milestone Method (Topic 605)," which provides g uidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P58_S2	This ASU is effective in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P58_S3	We do not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2010-17 to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P59_S0	In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-13, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)," which provides guidance on the classification of a share-based payment award as either equity or a liability.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P59_S1	A share-based payment award that contains a condition that is not a market, performance, or service condition is required to be classified as a liability.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P59_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fi scal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2010.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P59_S3	The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2010-13 to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P59_S4	The objective of this ASU was to remove the requirement for an SEC filer to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in both issued and revised financial statements.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P59_S5	This ASU is to be applied immediately upon issuance.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P59_S6	The Company adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2010 and the adoption of this ASU did not have an effect on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P59_S7	This ASU requires new disclosures regarding significant transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2, and information about activity in Level 3 fair value measurements.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P59_S8	In addition, this ASU clarifies existing disclosures regarding input and valuation techniques, as well as the level of disaggregation for each class of assets and liabilities.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P59_S9	This ASU was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for certain Level 3 activity disclosure requirements, which are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P59_S10	The Company adopted the new guidance in the first quarter of 2010, except for the disclosures related to purchases, sales, issuance and settlements, which will b e effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2011.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P59_S11	Because these new standards are related primarily to disclosures, their adoption has not had and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P60_S0	In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) No. 2009-14 on FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC 985 ), Software Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements-a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P60_S1	The objective of this ASU is to clarify which revenue allocation and measurement guidance should be used for arrangements that contain both tangible products and software, in cases where the software is more than incid ental to the tangible product as a whole.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P60_S2	More specifically, if the software sold with or embedded within the tangible product is essential to the functionality of the tangible product, then this software as well as undelivered software elements that relate to this software are excluded from the scope of existing software revenue guidance, which is expected to decrease the amount of revenue deferred in these cases.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P61_S0	entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, which for the Company is its fiscal year 2011.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P61_S1	Early adoption is permitted, but this ASU must be adopted in the same period as, and use the same transition method that is used for, the ASU described in the following paragraph.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P61_S2	The Company does not expect th e adoption of ASU No. 2009-14 to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P62_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13 on FASB ASC 605, Revenue Recognition Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P62_S1	The objective of this ASU is to address the accounting for multiple-deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services (deliverables) separately rather than as a combined unit.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P63_S0	Vendors often provide multiple products or services to their customers.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P63_S1	Those deliverables are often provided at different points in time or over different time periods.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P63_S2	This ASU provides amendments to the criteria in FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605-25 for separating consideratio n in multiple-deliverable arrangements.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P63_S3	The amendments in this ASU establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P63_S4	The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available, third-party evidence if vendor-specific objective evidence is not available, or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P63_S5	The amendments in this ASU also will replace the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity-specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P63_S6	This update is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P63_S7	The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of this new accounting update on its consolidated financial statements.

1094392_11_ITEM15_P70_S0	Fair Value Measurements: The Company applies a three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurements.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P70_S1	This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P71_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P71_S1	Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P71_S2	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management s assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	A financial asset or liability s fair value measurement classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P72_S1	The following tables provide the assets carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 201 0 :
1094392_11_ITEM15_P73_S0	The Company s investments classified as Level 1 are based on quoted prices that are available in active markets.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P74_S0	The forward foreign currency exchange contracts are primarily measured based on the foreign currency spot and forward rates quoted by the banks or foreign currency dealers.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P74_S1	The U.S. Treasury Notes are measured based on quoted market prices.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P74_S2	Level 2 investments are valued using observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P74_S3	These investments, which are held by a custodian, include: municipal bonds and government-sponsored enterprise securities.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P75_S0	Investment prices are obtained from third party pricing providers, which models prices utilizing the above observable inputs, for each asset class.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P76_S0	Level 3 investments consist of auction rate securities for which the Company uses a discounted cash flow model to value these investments.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P76_S1	This table presents a reconciliation for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the year ended December 31, 2010 :
1094392_11_ITEM15_P77_S0	The carrying value of other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P78_S0	See Note 5 for additional discussion regarding the fair value of the Company s marketable securities.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P79_S0	Marketable Securities: The Company has evaluated its investment policies and determined that all of its investment securities are to be classified as available-for-sale.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P79_S1	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported in Stockholders Equity under the caption Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P79_S2	Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in Other income (expense).
1094392_11_ITEM15_P79_S3	Net realized losses of $79, $1 and $0 were included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , respectively.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P79_S4	The Company records other-than-temporary impairment charges for its available-for-sale investments when it intends to sell the securities, it is more likely than not that i t will be required to sell the securities before a recovery, or when it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the securities.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P80_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P80_S1	As of December 31, 2010 , the Company held one auction-rate security with a fair value of $267 .
1094392_11_ITEM15_P80_S2	The underlying asset of the Company s auction-rate security consisted of a municipal bond with an auction reset feature.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P80_S3	Due to auction failures in the marketplace, the Company will not have access to these funds unless (a) futu re auctions occur and are successful, (b) the security is called by the issuer, (c) the Company sells the security in an available secondary market, or (d) the underlying note matures.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P80_S4	Currently, there are no active secondary markets.

1094392_11_ITEM15_P80_S7	The Company has determined that the gross unrealized losses on its marketable securities at December 31, 2009 and 2010 are temporary in nature.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P80_S8	The Company reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P80_S9	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, credit quality and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P81_S0	At December 31, 2009 and 2010 , marketable securities are categorized as follows:
1094392_11_ITEM15_P82_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable securities classified by the maturity date listed on the security, regardless of the Consolidated Balance Sheet classification, is as follows at December 31, 2009 and 2010 :
1094392_11_ITEM15_P83_S0	aggregated by investment instrument and period of time in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2009 and 2010 .

1094392_11_ITEM15_P89_S2	Goodwill The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows:
1094392_11_ITEM15_P90_S0	Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets Impairment During October 2008, the Company experienced a significant decline in its stock price.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P90_S1	As a result of the decline in stock price, the Company s market capitalization plus an implied control premium fell significantly below the recorded value of its consolidated net assets as of October 31, 2008.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P91_S0	In performing the goodwill impairment test, the Company used current market capitalization, control premiums, discounted cash flows and other factors as the best evidence of fair value.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P91_S1	The impairment test resulted in no value attributable to the Company s goodwill and accordingly, the Company wrote off all of its $192.9 million o f goodwill as of October 31, 2008.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P92_S0	In connection with the goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2008, the Company determined that its identifiable acquired intangible assets were impaired.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P92_S1	The determination was based on the carrying values exceeding the future undiscounted cash flows and fair value attributable to such intangible assets.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P92_S2	As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $34.2 million, which represents the difference between the estimated fair values of these long-lived assets as compared to their carrying values.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P92_S3	Fair values were determined based upon market conditions, the relief from royalty approach which utilized cash flow projections, and other factors.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P93_S0	The Company has entered into agreements with customers that include limited intellectual property indemnification obligations that are customary in the industry.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P93_S1	These guarantees generally require the Company to compensate the other party for certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising from these transactions.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P93_S2	The nature of the intellectual property indemnification obligations prevents the Company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay t o its customers.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P93_S3	Historically, the Company has not made any indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.

1094392_11_ITEM15_P94_S3	The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its re corded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P94_S4	Settlements of warranty reserves are generally associated with sales that occurred during the 12 to 15 months prior to the year-end and warranty accruals are related to sales during the year.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P94_S5	Changes in the Company s warranty reserves are as follows:

1094392_11_ITEM15_P120_S1	The decrease in valuation allowance of $6,028 is primarily due to utilization of domestic net operating loss carry forwards.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P121_S0	on substantially all of the Company s deferred tax assets as of December 3 1, 2009 and 2010 , except for $3,094 and $3,217 of research and development credits which are reserved for in the Company s provision for uncertain tax positions and $4 and $0 for alternative minimum tax credits, as the Company has incurred cumulative losses.

1094392_11_ITEM15_P123_S1	If it is determined that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against the deferred tax assets.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P124_S0	The ultimate realization of the assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences become deductible.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P124_S1	Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax pla nning strategies when making this assessment.
1094392_11_ITEM15_P124_S2	At December 31, 2010 , the Company had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $0, $15,147 and $1,696, respectively.

1094392_11_ITEM15_P153_S0	I, Steven R. Roth, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that the Annual Report of Rudolph Technologies, Inc. on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 fully co mplies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and that information contained in such Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly presents in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of Rudolph Technologies, Inc.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	General Rudolph Technologies, Inc. is a worldwide leader in the design, development, and manufacture of high-performance process control defect inspection, metrology, and process control software systems used by microelectronics device manufacturers.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	We provide yield management solutions used in both wafer processing and final manufacturing through a family of standalone systems for macro-defect inspection, probe card test and analysis, and transparent and opaque thin film measurements.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P0_S2	All of these systems feature sophisticated software and production-worthy automation.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P0_S3	In addition, our advanced process control software portfolio includes powerful solutions to enhance productivity and achieve significant cost savings.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	Rudolph systems are backed by worldwide customer service and applications support.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	Rudolph is among selected suppliers chosen to support 450mm wafer processing research and development.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our latest-generation defect inspection and thin film metrology tools are designed to increase the value of inspection and metrology data to ensure improved process yields and profitability as the industry moves toward a full 450mm production ramp in the 2015 time-frame.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	Continuing our focus on new markets and new applications, Rudolph has expanded its presence in the LED device manufacturing segment.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	A leading US-based market leader in LEDs placed new orders in 2011 for several Rudolph solutions including the Explorer Automated Macro Defect Inspection System as well as data analysis, process control and factory automation software.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	defects and yield loss in both front- and back-end processes; Rudolph s expertise in maximizing yield for semiconductor manufacturers has been a major factor in making inroads in this important, growing market.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	New products introduced in 2011 include the NSX 320 and Wafer Scanner 3880 inspection systems, both optimized for TSV (through-silicon-via) processes.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P3_S2	Our customers are aggressively working on multiple TSV applications that we believe will require the unique 2D/3D inspection capabilities of these new tools.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	Chip manufacturers deploy advanced macro-defect inspection throughout the fab to monitor key process steps, gather process-enhancing information and ultimately, lower manufacturing costs.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	Field-established tools such as the AXi , NSX and most recently, the F30 inspection systems, are found in wafer processing (front-end) and final manufacturing (back-end) facilities around the world.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P4_S2	These high-speed tools incorporate features such as waferless recipe creation, tool-to-tool correlation and multiple inspection resolutions.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P4_S3	In addition to wafer frontside inspection, Rudolph s innovative Explorer Inspection Cluster incorporates wafer edge and backside inspection in one integrated platform to enhance productivity and continuously improve fab yield.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Using products such as Discover and Genesis yield management software, the vast amount of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed and classified to determine trends that ultimately affect yield.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	Rudolph s patented transparent film technology uses up to four lasers operating simultaneously at multiple angles and multiple wavelengths, providing powerful analysis and measurement capabilities.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	Unlike the white-light sources used in spectroscopic ellipsometers, laser light sources make our metrology tools inherently stable, increase measurement speed and accuracy, and reduce maintenance costs by minimizing the time required to re-qualify a light source when it is replaced.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	Rudolph s S3000 System employs a proprietary reflectometer technology that allows the characterization of films and film stacks that cannot be performed using conventional reflectometry or ellipsometry alone.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	For opaque film characterization, the MetaPULSE System gives customers the ability to simultaneously measure the thickness and other properties of up to six metal or other opaque film layers in a non-contact manner on product wafers.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	PULSE Technology uses an ultra-fast laser to generate sound waves that pass down through a stack of opaque films such as those used in copper or aluminum interconnect processes, sending back to the surface an echo that indicates film thickness, density, and other process critical parameters.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	We believe we are a leader in providing systems that can non-destructively measure opaque thin-film stacks with the speed and accuracy semiconductor device manufacturers demand in order to achieve high yields with the latest fabrication processes.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	The technology is ideal for characterizing copper interconnect structures and the majority of all systems sold have been for copper applications.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	Rudolph has a comprehensive offering of process control software solutions for semiconductor, solar and LED manufacturing.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	We provide a wide range of advanced process control solutions, all designed to improve factory profitability, including run-to-run control, fault detection, classification and tool automation.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	Rudolph is the #1 provider of Process Control Software in the semiconductor industry.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Technology We believe that our expertise in engineering and our continued investment in research and development enable us to rapidly develop new technologies and products in response to emerging industry trends.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	The breadth of our technology enables us to offer a diverse combination of measurement technologies that provide process control for the majority of thin films used in semiconductor manufacturing.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	Additionally, our defect detection and classification technologies allow us to provide yield enhancement for critical front-end processes such as photolithography, diffusion, etch, CMP and outgoing quality control.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Information learned through post-fab inspection is critical.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	Advanced macro defect inspection within the final manufacturing (back-end) process provides our customers with critical quality assurance and process information.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing or general handling, and can have a major impact on device and process quality.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	Automating the defect detection and classification process is best done by a system that can mimic, or even extend, the response of the human eye, but at a much higher speed, with high resolution and more consistently.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	To do this, our systems capture full-color whole wafer images using simultaneous dark and bright field illumination.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	The resulting bright and dark field images are compared to those from an ideal wafer having no defects.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P14_S3	When a difference is detected, its image is broken down into mathematical vectors that allow rapid and accurate comparison with a library of known classified defects stored in the tool s database.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	proprietary enhancements of this approach enable very fast and highly repeatable image classification.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	The system is pre-programmed with an extensive library of default local, global, and color defects and can also absorb a virtually unlimited amount of new defect classes.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P15_S2	This allows customers to define defects based on their existing defect classification system, provides more reliable automated rework decisions, and enables more accurate statistical process control data.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	All-surface refers to inspection of the wafer frontside, edge, and backside as well as post-fab die.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	The edge inspection process focuses on the area near the wafer edge, an area that poses difficulty for traditional wafer frontside inspection technology due to its varied topography and process variation.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	Edge bevel inspection looks for defects on the side edge of a wafer.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	The edge bead removal and edge exclusion metrology involve a topside surface measurement required exclusively in the photolithography process, primarily to determine if wafers have been properly aligned for the edge exclusion region.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	The primary reason for wafer backside inspection is to determine if contamination has been created that may spread throughout the fab.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	For instance, it is critical that the wafer backside be free of defects prior to the photolithography process to prevent focus and exposure problems on the wafer front-side.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	In addition to the wafer processing floor, Rudolph s automated inspection systems are used in several post-fab processes such as bump inspection, wafer probe, wafer saw and quality control and in new process technologies such as TSV.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	Classifying defects off-line enables automated inspection systems to maintain their high throughput.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	Using defect image files captured by automated inspection systems, operators are able to view high-resolution defect images to determine defects that cause catastrophic failure of a device, or killer defects.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P20_S2	Classifying defects enables faster analysis by grouping defects found together as one larger defect, a scratch for example, and defects of similar types across a wafer lot to be grouped based on size, repeating defects and other user-defined specifications.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P20_S3	Automatically classifying defects provides far greater yield learning than human classification.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	Using wafer maps, charts and graphs, the vast amounts of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed to determine trends across bumps, die, wafers and lots.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	This analysis may determine where in the process an inconsistency is being introduced, allowing for enhancements to be made and yields improved.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	Defect data analysis is performed to identify, analyze and locate the source of defects and other manufacturing process excursions.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	Using either a single wafer map or a composite map created from multiple wafer maps, this analysis enables identification of defect patterns and distribution.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	When combined with inspection data from strategically-placed inspection points, this analysis may pinpoint the source of the defects so corrective action can be taken.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P22_S3	The combination of Fast 3D-OCM (optical comparative metrology) Technology with improved testing accuracy and repeatability is designed to reduce total test time for even the most advanced large area probe cards.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P22_S4	3-D capabilities enable users to analyze probe marks and probe tips in a rapid and information-rich format.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	Optical acoustic metrology involves the use of ultra-fast laser induced sonar for metal and opaque thin film measurement.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	This technology sends ultrasonic waves into multi-layer opaque films and then analyzes the resulting echoes to simultaneously determine the thickness of each individual layer in complex multi-layer metal film stacks.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	The echo s amplitude and phase can be used to detect film properties, missing layers, and interlayer problems.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P23_S3	Since different phenomena affect amplitude and phase uniquely, a variety of process critical interlayer problems can be detected in a single measurement.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	The use of optical acoustics to measure multi-layer metal and opaque films was pioneered by scientists at Brown University ( Brown ) in collaboration with engineers at Rudolph.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	The proprietary optical acoustic technology in our PULSE Technology systems measures the thickness of single or multi-layer opaque films ranging from less than 40 Angstroms to greater than five microns.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	It provides these measurements at a rate of up to 70 wafers per hour within one to two percent accuracy and typically less than one percent repeatability.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P24_S3	This range of thicknesses covers the majority of thick and thin metal films projected by the International Roadmap for Semiconductors to be used through the end of this decade.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our non-contact, non-destructive optical acoustic technology and small spot size enable our PULSE Technology systems to measure film properties directly on product wafers.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Ellipsometry is a non-contact, non-destructive optical technique for transparent thin film measurement.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	We have been an industry leader in ellipsometry technology for the last three decades.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	on several ellipsometry technologies, including our proprietary technique that uses four lasers for multiple-angle of incidence, multiple wavelength ellipsometry.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	Laser ellipsometry technology enables our transparent film systems to continue to provide the increasingly higher level of accuracy needed as thinner films and newer materials are introduced for future generations of semiconductor devices.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	We extended this same optical technology to characterize the scatterometry signal from patterned surfaces, allowing measurement of critical dimensions.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P27_S3	For applications requiring broader spectral coverage, some of our ellipsometry tools are also equipped with a reflectometer.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	Reflectometry uses a white or ultraviolet light source to determine the properties of transparent thin films by analyzing the wavelength and intensity of light reflected from the surface of a wafer.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	This optical information is processed with software algorithms to determine film thickness and other material properties.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P28_S2	By combining data from both the laser ellipsometer and broad spectrum reflectometer, it is possible to characterize films and film stacks that cannot be adequately analyzed by either method individually.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	Advanced Process Control (APC) employs software to automatically detect or predict tool failure (fault detection) as well as calculate recipe settings for a process that will drive the process output to target despite variations in the incoming material and disturbances within the process equipment.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	Process control software enables the factory to increase capacity and yield and to decrease rework and scrap.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P29_S2	It enables reduced production costs by lowering consumables, process engineering time and manufacturing cycle time.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	Products Rudolph markets and sells products to all major logic, memory, data storage and application-specific integrated circuit ( ASIC ) device manufacturers.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	Our customers rely on us for versatile full-fab inspection and metrology systems as well as process control software solutions.

1094392_12_ITEM1_P32_S4	In 2011 , sales to Infineon Technologies and Samsung Semiconductor Inc. accounted for 13.5% and 12.1% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P32_S5	No other individual end user customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2009 , 2010 and 2011 .
1094392_12_ITEM1_P32_S6	We do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	Research and Development The macro-defect inspection, thin film transparent and opaque process control metrology market is characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	We believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products is critical to our success.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our technical, management and financial resources to research and development programs.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P33_S3	The core competencies of our research and development team include metrology systems for high volume manufacturing, ellipsometry, ultra-fast optics, picosecond acoustic and optical design, advanced metrology application development and algorithm development.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P33_S4	To leverage our internal research and development capabilities, we maintain close relationships with leading research institutions in the metrology field, including Brown University.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P33_S5	Our relationship with Brown University has resulted in the development of the optical acoustic technology underlying our Meta PULSE product line.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P33_S6	We have been granted exclusive licenses from Brown University Research Foundation, subject to rights retained by Brown and the United States government for their own non-commercial uses for several patents relating to this technology.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P33_S7	Our research and development expenditures in 2009 , 2010 and 2011 were $26.0 million , $33.4 million and $36.3 million , respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P33_S8	We plan to continue our strong commitment to new product development in the future, and we expect that our level of research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollar terms in future periods.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	We maintain an extensive network of direct sales, customer service and application support offices in several locations throughout the world.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	We maintain sales, service or applications offices in locations including, but not limited to, New Jersey, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Texas, Washington, New York, Scotland, Israel, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, China and Japan.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P34_S2	We provide our customers with comprehensive support before, during and after the delivery of our products.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P34_S3	For example, in order to facilitate the smooth integration of our tools into our customers operations, we often assign dedicated, site-specific field service and applications engineers to provide long-term support at selected customer sites.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P34_S4	We also provide comprehensive service and applications training for customers at our training facility in Budd Lake, New Jersey and at customer locations.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P34_S5	In addition, we maintain a group of highly skilled applications scientists at strategically located facilities throughout the world and at selected customer locations.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	Manufacturing Our principal manufacturing activities include assembly, final test and calibration.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	These activities are conducted in our manufacturing facility in Minnesota.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P35_S2	During the fourth quarter of 2009 , we initiated a consolidation of a portion of our facility in Budd Lake, NJ and in 2010 we moved the New Jersey manufacturing operations to our facility in Bloomington, MN.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P35_S3	Our core manufacturing competencies include electrical, optical and mechanical assembly and testing as well as the management of new product transitions.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	wherever possible, most mechanical parts, metal fabrications and critical components used in our products are engineered and manufactured to our specifications.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P36_S1	We expect to rely increasingly on subcontractors and turnkey suppliers to fabricate components, build assemblies and perform other non-core activities in a cost-effective manner.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P36_S2	We rely on a number of limited source suppliers for certain parts and subassemblies.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P36_S3	This reliance creates a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components, and reduced control over pricing and time of delivery of components.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P36_S4	An inability to obtain adequate supplies would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or might require us to redesign our systems to accommodate different components or subassemblies.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P36_S5	To date, we have not experienced any significant delivery delays.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P36_S6	However, if we were forced to seek alternative sources of supply, manufacture such components or subassemblies internally, or redesign our products, this could prevent us from shipping our products to our customers on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	We have a policy of seeking patents on inventions governing new products or technologies as part of our ongoing research, development, and manufacturing activities.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , we have been granted, or hold exclusive licenses to, 202 U.S. and foreign patents.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P37_S2	The patents we own, jointly own or exclusively license have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2030 .
1094392_12_ITEM1_P37_S3	We also have 100 pending regular and provisional applications in the U.S. and other countries.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P37_S4	Our patents and applications principally cover various aspects of macro-defect detection and classification, transparent thin film measurement and altered material characterization.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P37_S5	We have been granted exclusive licenses from Brown University Research Foundation, subject to rights retained by Brown and the United States government for their own non-commercial uses, for several patents relating to the optical acoustic technology underlying our Meta PULSE product family.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P37_S6	The terms of these exclusive licenses are equal to the lives of the patents.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P37_S7	We pay royalties to Brown based upon a percentage of our revenues from the sale of systems that incorporate technology covered by the Brown patents.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P37_S8	We also have the right to support patent activity with respect to new ultra-fast acoustic technology developed by Brown scientists, and to acquire exclusive licenses to this technology.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P37_S9	Brown may terminate the licenses if we fail to pay royalties to Brown or if we materially breach our license agreement with Brown.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P37_S10	Our pending patents may never be issued, and even if they are, these patents, our existing patents and the patents we license may not provide sufficiently broad protection to protect our proprietary rights, or they may prove to be unenforceable.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P37_S11	To protect our proprietary rights, we also rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions and licenses.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P37_S12	There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same degree as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial infringement problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in such countries, some of which are countries in which we have sold and continue to sell products.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	There is a risk that our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P38_S2	For example, our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P38_S3	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	Competition The market for semiconductor capital equipment is highly competitive.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	We face substantial competition from established companies in each of the markets that we serve.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P39_S2	We principally compete with KLA-Tencor and Camtek.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P39_S3	We compete to a lesser extent with companies such as Nanometrics and Nikon.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P39_S4	Each of our products also competes with products that use different metrology techniques.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P39_S5	Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, broader product offerings and service capabilities and larger installed customer bases than we do.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P39_S6	Significant competitive factors in the market for inspection and metrology systems include system performance, ease of use, reliability, cost of ownership, technical support and customer relationships.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	To remain competitive, we believe we will need to maintain a high level of investment in research and development and process applications.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	No assurances can be given that we will continue to be competitive in the future.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	Backlog We schedule production of our systems based upon order backlog and informal customer forecasts.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P41_S1	We include in backlog only those orders to which the customer has assigned a purchase order number and for which delivery is anticipated within 12 months.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P41_S2	Because shipment dates may be changed and customers may cancel or delay orders with little or no penalty, our backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P41_S3	At December 31, 2011 , we had a backlog of approximately $53.2 million compared with a backlog of approximately $49.7 million at December 31, 2010 .
1094392_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	Employees As of December 31, 2011 , we had 564 employees.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P42_S1	Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements, and we have never experienced a work stoppage.
1094392_12_ITEM1_P42_S2	We believe our employee relations are good.

1094392_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Risks Related to Rudolph Our operating results have varied, and will likely continue to vary significantly, from quarter to quarter in the future, causing volatility in our stock price Our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and will likely continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, causing volatility in our stock price.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Some of the factors that may influence our operating results and subject our stock to extreme price and volume fluctuations include:
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	the levels of our fixed expenses, including research and development costs associated with product development, relative to our revenue levels.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In light of these factors and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Moreover, many of our expenses are fixed in the short-term which, together with the need for continued investment in research and development, marketing and customer support, limits our ability to reduce expenses quickly.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P1_S3	As a result, declines in net sales could harm our business and the price of our common stock could substantially decline.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our largest customers account for a significant portion of our revenues, and our revenues and cash flows could significantly decline if one or more of these customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems or they delayed or canceled a large order Sales to end user customers that individually represent at least five percent of our revenues typically account for, in the aggregate, a considerable amount of our revenues.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We operate in the highly concentrated, capital-intensive semiconductor device manufacturing industry.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Historically, a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers, and this trend is expected to continue.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	If any of our key customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems in the future, or if a large order were delayed or canceled, our revenues and cash flows could significantly decline.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We expect that we will continue to depend on a small number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenues.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	In addition, as large semiconductor device manufacturers seek to establish closer relationships with their suppliers, we expect that our customer base will become even more concentrated.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Our customers may be unable to pay us for our products and services Our customers include some companies that may from time to time encounter financial difficulties, especially in light of the current economic environment and the turmoil in the credit markets.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P2_S6	If a customer s financial difficulties become severe, the customer may be unwilling or unable to pay our invoices in the ordinary course of business, which could adversely affect collections of both our accounts receivable and unbilled services.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P2_S7	The bankruptcy of a customer with a substantial account receivable could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P2_S8	In addition, if a customer declares bankruptcy after paying us certain invoices, a court may determine that we are not properly entitled to that payment and may require repayment of some or all of the amount we received, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P2_S9	Variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our systems may cause fluctuations in our operating results, which could cause our stock price to decline Variations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our revenues and cash flows, and consequently, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, to fluctuate widely from period to period.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P2_S10	This variation could cause our stock price to decline.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P2_S11	Our customers generally take a long time to evaluate our inspection and/or film metrology systems and many people are involved in the evaluation process.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P2_S12	We expend significant resources educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our systems in the semiconductor fabrication process.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P2_S13	The length of time it takes for us to make a sale depends upon many factors including, but not limited to:
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	the quality and sophistication of the customer s current metrology and/or inspection equipment.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Because of the number of factors influencing the sales process, the period between our initial contact with a customer and the time when we recognize revenue from that customer and receive payment, if ever, varies widely in length.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our sales cycles, including the time it takes for us to build a product to customer specifications after receiving an order to the time we recognize revenue, typically range from six to 15 months.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Sometimes our sales cycles can be much longer, particularly with customers in Japan.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	During these cycles, we commit substantial resources to our sales efforts in advance of receiving any revenue, and we may never receive any revenue from a customer despite our sales efforts.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P4_S4	If we do make a sale, our customers often purchase only one of our systems, and then evaluate its performance for a lengthy period before purchasing any more of our systems.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P4_S5	The number of additional products a customer purchases, if any, depends on many factors, including the customer s capacity requirements.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P4_S6	The period between a customer s initial purchase and any subsequent purchases can vary from six months to a year or longer, and variations in the length of this period could cause further fluctuations in our operating results and possibly in our stock price.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Most of our revenues have been derived from customers outside of the United States subjecting us to operational, financial and political risks, such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs, political and economic instability, outbreaks of hostilities, and difficulties in managing foreign sales representatives and foreign branch operations Due to the significant level of our international sales, we are subject to a number of material risks, including: Compliance with foreign laws.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our business is subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally, including compliance with, inconsistencies among, and unexpected changes in, a wide variety of foreign laws and regulatory environments with which we are not familiar, including, among other issues, with respect to employees, protection of our intellectual property, and a wide variety of operational regulations and trade and export controls under domestic, foreign, and international law.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including tariffs and other market barriers.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The semiconductor device industry is a high-visibility industry in many of the European and Asian countries in which we sell our products.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Because the governments of these countries have provided extensive financial support to our semiconductor device manufacturing customers in these countries, we believe that our customers could be disproportionately affected by any trade embargoes, excise taxes or other restrictions imposed by their governments on trade with United States companies such as ourselves.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Any restrictions of these types could result in a reduction in our sales to customers in these countries.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We are subject to various global risks related to political and economic instabilities in countries in which we derive sales.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If terrorist activities, armed conflict, civil or military unrest or political instability occurs outside of the U.S., these events may result in reduced demand for our products.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	There is considerable political instability in Taiwan related to its disputes with China and in South Korea related to its disputes with North Korea.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In addition, several Asian countries, particularly Japan, have experienced significant economic instability.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	An outbreak of hostilities or other political upheaval in China, Taiwan or South Korea, or an economic downturn in Japan or other countries, would likely harm the operations of our customers in these countries.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The effect of these types of events on our revenues and cash flows could be material because we derive substantial revenues from sales to semiconductor device foundries in Taiwan such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd., from memory chip manufacturers in South Korea such as Samsung, and from semiconductor device manufacturers in Japan such as Toshiba.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign branch operations.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	During periods of tension between the governments of the United States and certain other countries, it is often difficult for United States companies such as ourselves to staff and manage operations in such countries.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Language and other cultural differences may also inhibit our sales and marketing efforts and create internal communication problems among our U.S. and foreign research and development teams, increasing the difficulty of managing multiple, remote locations performing various development, quality assurance, and yield ramp analysis projects.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Currency fluctuations as compared to the U.S. Dollar.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	A substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As a result, if the dollar rises in value in relation to foreign currencies, our systems will become more expensive to customers outside the United States and less competitive with systems produced by competitors outside the United States.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P10_S3	These conditions could negatively impact our international sales.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	also expose us to collection risk in the event it becomes more expensive for our foreign customers to convert their local currencies into U.S. dollars.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Additionally, in the event a larger portion of our revenue becomes denominated in foreign currencies, we would be subject to a potentially significant exchange rate risk.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If we deliver systems with defects, our credibility will be harmed and the sales and market acceptance of our systems will decrease Our systems are complex and have occasionally contained errors, defects and bugs when introduced.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing or general handling, and can have a major impact on device and process quality.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	When this occurs, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our systems could be harmed.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Further, if our systems contain errors, defects or bugs, computer viruses or malicious code as a result of cyber attacks to our computer networks, we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate these problems.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Defects could also lead to product liability as a result of product liability lawsuits against us or against our customers.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We have agreed to indemnify our customers under certain circumstances against liability arising from defects in our systems.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our product liability policy currently provides $2.0 million of aggregate coverage, with an overall umbrella limit of $14.0 million .
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	In the event of a successful product liability claim, we could be obligated to pay damages significantly in excess of our product liability insurance limits.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If we are not successful in developing new and enhanced products for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry, we will lose market share to our competitors We operate in an industry that is highly competitive and subject to evolving industry standards, rapid technological changes, rapid changes in consumer demands and the rapid introduction of new, higher performance systems with shorter product life cycles.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	To be competitive in our demanding market, we must continually design, develop and introduce in a timely manner new inspection and film metrology systems that meet the performance and price demands of semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We must also continue to refine our current systems so that they remain competitive.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We expect to continue to make significant investments in our research and development activities.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We may experience difficulties or delays in our development efforts with respect to new systems, and we may not ultimately be successful in our product enhancement efforts to improve and advance products or in responding effectively to technological change, as not all research and development activities result in viable commercial products.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P14_S5	In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to develop new products for the most opportunistic new markets and applications.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Any significant delay in releasing new systems could cause our products to become obsolete, adversely affect our reputation, give a competitor a first-to-market advantage or cause a competitor to achieve greater market share.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P14_S7	In addition, new product offerings that are highly complex in terms of software or hardware may require application or service work such as bug fixing prior to acceptance, thereby delaying revenue recognition.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P14_S8	If new products developed by us do not gain general market acceptance, we will be unable to generate revenues and recover our research and development costs Metrology and inspection product development is inherently risky because it is difficult to foresee developments in semiconductor device manufacturing technology, coordinate technical personnel, and identify and eliminate system design flaws.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P14_S9	Further, our products are complex and often the applications to our customers businesses are unique.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P14_S10	Any new systems we introduce may not achieve or sustain a significant degree of market acceptance and sales.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P14_S11	We expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources developing new systems and refining our existing systems.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P14_S12	In light of the long product development cycles inherent in our industry, these expenditures will be made well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenue from the sale of those systems.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P14_S13	Our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market new systems are subject to a wide variety of challenges during the development cycle, including start-up bugs, design defects, and other matters that could delay introduction of these systems.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P14_S14	In addition, since our customers are not obligated by long-term contracts to purchase our systems, our anticipated product orders may not materialize, or orders that are placed may be canceled.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P14_S15	As a result, if we do not achieve market acceptance of new products, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows to recover our research and development costs and our market share, revenue, operating results or stock price would be negatively impacted.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Even if we are able to develop new products that gain market acceptance, sales of these new products could impair our ability to sell existing products Competition from our new systems could have a negative effect on sales of our existing systems and the prices that we could charge for these systems.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We may also divert sales and marketing resources from our current systems in order to successfully launch and promote our new or next generation systems.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	This diversion of resources could have a further negative effect on sales of our current systems and the value of inventory.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If our relationships with our large customers deteriorate, our product development activities could be adversely affected The success of our product development efforts depends on our ability to anticipate market trends and the price, performance and functionality requirements of semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In order to anticipate these trends and ensure that critical development projects proceed in a coordinated manner, we must continue to collaborate closely with our largest customers.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Our relationships with these and other customers provide us with access to valuable information regarding trends in the semiconductor device industry, which enables us to better plan our product development activities.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P15_S6	If our current relationships with our large customers are impaired, or if we are unable to develop similar collaborative relationships with important customers in the future, our product development activities could be adversely affected.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Our ability to reduce costs is limited by our ongoing need to invest in research and development and to provide customer support activities Our industry is characterized by the need for continual investment in research and development as well as customer service and support.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P15_S8	As a result, our operating results could be materially affected if operating costs associated with our research and development as well as customer support activities increase in the future or we are unable to reduce those activities.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P15_S9	We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property and, therefore, lose our competitive advantage Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology for our principal product families, and we rely, in part, on patent and trade secret law and confidentiality agreements to protect that technology.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P15_S10	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it will give our competitors a significant advantage.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P15_S11	We own or have licensed a number of patents relating to our transparent and opaque thin film metrology and macro-defect inspection systems, and have filed applications for additional patents.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P15_S12	Any of our pending patent applications may be rejected, and we may be unable to develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable in the future.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P15_S13	In addition, the patents that we do own or that have been issued or licensed to us may not provide us with competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P15_S14	Further, third parties may also design around these patents.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In addition to patent protection, we rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and technology.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and other third parties.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Even though these agreements are in place there can be no assurances that trade secrets and proprietary information will not be disclosed, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, or that we can fully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Violations by others of our confidentiality agreements and the loss of employees who have specialized knowledge and expertise could harm our competitive position and cause our sales and operating results to decline as a result of increased competition.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Costly and time-consuming litigation might be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection might adversely affect our ability to continue our research or bring products to market.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Protection of our intellectual property rights, or the efforts of third parties to enforce their own intellectual property rights against us, may result in costly and time-consuming litigation, substantial damages, lost product sales and/or the loss of important intellectual property rights We may be required to initiate litigation in order to enforce any patents issued to or licensed by us, or to determine the scope or validity of a third party s patent or other proprietary rights.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Any litigation, regardless of outcome, could be expensive and time consuming, and could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to re-engineer our products or obtain expensive licenses from third parties.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	In addition, our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P17_S4	From time to time, we may receive communications from third parties asserting that our products or systems infringe, or may infringe, the proprietary rights of these third parties.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P17_S5	These claims of infringement may lead to protracted and costly litigation, which could require us to pay substantial damages or have the sale of our products or systems stopped by an injunction.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Infringement claims could also cause product or system delays or require us to redesign our products or systems, and these delays could result in the loss of substantial revenues.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P17_S7	We may also be required to obtain a license from the third party or cease activities utilizing the third party s proprietary rights.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P17_S8	We may not be able to enter into such a license or such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P17_S9	Accordingly, the loss of important intellectual property rights could hinder our ability to sell our systems, or make the sale of these systems more expensive.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P17_S10	For additional information regarding recent patent litigation, see Item 3.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in certain foreign countries, where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the United States The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement abroad.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	For example, Taiwan is not a signatory of the Patent Cooperation Treaty, which is designed to specify rules and methods for defending intellectual property internationally.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The publication of a patent in Taiwan prior to the filing of a patent in Taiwan would invalidate the ability of a company to obtain a patent in Taiwan.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Similarly, in contrast to the United States where the contents of patents remain confidential during the patent application process, in Taiwan the contents of a patent are published upon filing which provides competitors an advance view of the contents of a patent application prior to the establishment of patent rights.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Consequently, there is a risk that we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights in certain foreign countries.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P18_S5	If this occurs, it would be easier for our competitors to develop and sell competing products in these countries.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Some of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, and increased competition could impair sales of our products or cause us to reduce our prices The market for semiconductor capital equipment is highly competitive.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P18_S7	We face substantial competition from established companies in each of the markets we serve.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P18_S8	We principally compete with KLA-Tencor and Camtek.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P18_S9	We compete to a lesser extent with companies such as Nanometrics and Nikon.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P18_S10	Each of our products also competes with products that use different metrology or inspection techniques.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P18_S11	Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, broader product offerings and service capabilities and larger installed customer bases than we do.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P18_S12	As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or market developments by devoting greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products, which, in turn, could impair sales of our products.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P18_S13	Further, there may be significant merger and acquisition activity among our competitors and potential competitors, which, in turn, may provide them with a competitive advantage over us by enabling them to rapidly expand their product offerings and service capabilities to meet a broader range of customer needs.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Many of our customers and potential customers in the semiconductor device manufacturing industry are large companies that require global support and service for their semiconductor capital equipment.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We believe that our global support and service infrastructure is sufficient to meet the needs of our customers and potential customers.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	competing for the business of global semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Many of our competitors are investing heavily in the development of new systems that will compete directly with our systems.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We have from time to time selectively reduced prices on our systems in order to protect our market share, and competitive pressures may necessitate further price reductions.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We expect our competitors in each product area to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices and performance characteristics.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P20_S4	These product introductions would likely require us to decrease the prices of our systems and increase the level of discounts that we grant our customers.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Price reductions or lost sales as a result of these competitive pressures would reduce our total revenues and could adversely impact our financial results.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We believe that once a semiconductor device manufacturer has selected one vendor s capital equipment for a production-line application, the manufacturer generally relies upon that capital equipment and, to the extent possible, subsequent generations of the same vendor s equipment, for the life of the application.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Once a vendor s equipment has been installed in a production line application, a semiconductor device manufacturer must often make substantial technical modifications and may experience production-line downtime in order to switch to another vendor s equipment.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Accordingly, unless our systems offer performance or cost advantages that outweigh a customer s expense of switching to our systems, it will be difficult for us to achieve significant sales to that customer once it has selected another vendor s capital equipment for an application.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management, engineering, sales and marketing, customer support, finance and manufacturing personnel.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P21_S4	The loss of any of these key personnel, each of whom would be extremely difficult to replace, could harm our business and operating results.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Although we have employment and noncompetition agreements with key members of our senior management team, including Messrs. McLaughlin and Roth, these individuals or other key employees may still leave us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P21_S6	We do not have key person life insurance on any of our executives.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P21_S7	In addition, to support our future growth, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Competition for such personnel in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified employees.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P21_S9	We obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a limited group of suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenues We obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a limited group of suppliers and do not have long-term contracts with many of our suppliers.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P21_S10	Our dependence on limited source suppliers of components and our lack of long-term contracts with many of our suppliers exposes us to several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components, price increases, late deliveries and poor component quality.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P21_S11	Disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our systems, damage our customer relationships and reduce our sales.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	From time to time in the past, we have experienced temporary difficulties in receiving shipments from our suppliers.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The lead-time required for shipments of some of our components can be as long as four months.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In addition, the lead time required to qualify new suppliers for lasers could be as long as a year, and the lead time required to qualify new suppliers of other components could be as long as nine months.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	If we are unable to accurately predict our component needs, or if our component supply is disrupted, we may miss market opportunities by not being able to meet the demand for our systems.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Further, a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components or subassemblies could seriously harm our results of operations and cash flows.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	As a result of the effects of the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Japan, including the resultant nuclear crisis, certain of the Company s suppliers may be unable to deliver sufficient quantities of components or deliver them in a timely manner.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Further, depending on the length of these disruptions, we may need to locate alternate suppliers to fulfill our customers needs.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	; however, we cannot predict the ultimate impact the events in Japan, or similar unanticipated disasters may have, and it could have a material adverse affect on the Company s business.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility could have a material adverse effect on our revenues Our manufacturing processes are highly complex and require sophisticated and costly equipment and a specially designed facility.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	As a result, any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, or destruction of or damage as a result of a fire or any other reason, could seriously harm our ability to satisfy our customer order deadlines.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	If we cannot timely deliver our systems, our results from operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Our earnings could be negatively affected and our inventory levels could materially increase if we are unable to predict our inventory needs in an accurate and timely manner and adjust our orders for parts and subcomponents should our needs increase or decrease materially due to unexpected increases or decreases in demand for our products.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Any material increase in our inventories could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, while any material decrease in our ability to procure needed inventories could result in an inability to supply customer demand for our products, thus adversely affecting our revenues.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Our ability to fulfill our backlog may have an effect on our long term ability to procure contracts and fulfill current contracts Our ability to fulfill our backlog may be limited by our ability to devote sufficient financial and human capital resources and limited by available material supplies.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P25_S7	If we do not fulfill our backlog in a timely manner, we may experience delays in product delivery which would postpone receipt of revenue from those delayed deliveries.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P25_S8	Additionally, if we are consistently unable to fulfill our backlog, this may be a disincentive to customers to award large contracts to us in the future until they are comfortable that we can effectively manage our backlog.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P25_S9	We may choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves, and may be unable to complete these acquisitions or may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired business in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner Our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P25_S10	To this end, we have, from time to time, engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P25_S11	We may choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products, technologies and/or services instead of developing them ourselves.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P25_S12	We may, however, face competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established companies with greater financial resources, making it more difficult for us to complete acquisitions.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P25_S13	We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from one or more acquisitions that we consummate.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P25_S14	Integrating any business, product technology or service we acquire could be expensive and time-consuming and/or disrupt our ongoing business.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P25_S15	Further, there are numerous risks associated therewith, including but not limited to:
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	unexpected reduction of sales of existing products by new products.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such favorable terms or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations, including as a result of our incurrence of indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In order to finance any acquisitions, we might need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In that event, we could be forced to obtain financing on terms that are not favorable to us and, in the case of equity financing, that result in dilution to our stockholders.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In addition, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, amortization of intangible assets, write-down of other assets or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions and purchase accounting could harm our business and operating results.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	If we cannot effectively manage our growth, our business may suffer Over the long-term we intend to continue to grow by increasing our sales efforts and completing strategic acquisitions.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P27_S4	To effectively manage our growth, we must, among other things:
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	administer appropriate financial and administrative control procedures.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our anticipated growth will likely place a significant strain on our management, financial, operational, technical, sales and administrative resources.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Any failure to effectively manage our growth may cause our business to suffer and our stock price to decline.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Changes in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect results As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Our future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the (1) applicable tax laws; (2) composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates; or (3) valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P29_S3	In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P29_S4	We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Turmoil in the credit markets and the financial services industry may negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity During recent years, global credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy, failure, collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States and other governments.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	While the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted, they may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition if our ability to obtain credit from trade creditors were to be impaired.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	In addition, the economic crisis could also adversely impact our customers ability to finance the purchase of systems from us or our suppliers ability to provide us with product, either of which may negatively impact our business and results of operations.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations As a result of our sale of $60.0 million of 3.75% convertible senior notes on July 25, 2011 (the Notes ), we now have long-term debt that we have not had to maintain in the past.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our maintenance of indebtedness could have important consequences because:
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our ability to generate sufficient cash to pay our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash to pay our debt obligations, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of our debt obligations, seek to refinance all or a portion of our debt obligations or obtain additional financing.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P33_S3	There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Failure to make a payment on our debt obligations could also result in acceleration of all of our debt obligations, including the Notes, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P33_S5	We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or to repurchase the Notes Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture that governs the Notes), subject to certain conditions, holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P33_S6	In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, we will be required to make cash payments of up to $1,000 for each $1,000 in principal amount of Notes converted.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P33_S7	However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered for repurchase upon a fundamental change or to make cash payments in respect of Notes that are being converted.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P33_S8	In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P33_S9	Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P33_S10	A default under the indenture or a fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P33_S11	If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our operating results are subject to significant variation due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor device industry.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor device manufacturers, which, in turn, depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In recent years, the industry has experienced significant downturns, generally in connection with declines in economic conditions.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	This cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and, thus, future expense levels.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P36_S3	During a down cycle, we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P36_S4	In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P36_S5	We can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P36_S6	If we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business could be seriously harmed.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our future rate of growth is highly dependent on the development and growth of the market for microelectronic device inspection and metrology equipment We target our products to address the needs of microelectronic device manufacturers for defect inspection and metrology.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	If for any reason the market for microelectronic device inspection or metrology equipment fails to grow in the long term, we may be unable to maintain current revenue levels in the short term and maintain our historical growth in the long term.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Growth in the inspection market is dependent to a large extent upon microelectronic manufacturers replacing manual inspection with automated inspection technology.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Growth in the metrology market is dependent to a large extent upon new chip designs and capacity expansion of microelectronic manufacturers.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P38_S2	There is no assurance that manufacturers will undertake these actions at the rate we expect.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Risks Related to our Stock Provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law, as well as our stockholder rights plan, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and/or delay, deter or prevent a change in control of our company Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as our stockholder rights plan, may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board of Directors.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P38_S4	These provisions also limit the circumstances in which a premium can be paid for the common stock, and in which a proxy contest for control of our board may be initiated.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	the authority of our board, without stockholder approval, to adopt a Stockholder Rights Plan.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Such a Shareholder Rights Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on June 27, 2005 .
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We are also entitled to avail ourselves of the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could inhibit changes in control of us.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our stock price is volatile The market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	From the beginning of fiscal year 2009 through the end of fiscal year 2011 , our stock price fluctuated between a high of $12.75 per share and a low of $1.95 per share.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Factors affecting our stock price may include:
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	the number of firms making a market in our common stock.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	In addition, the stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	These fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high technology companies like ours.
1094392_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	These market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1094392_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our executive office building is located at One Rudolph Road in Flanders, New Jersey.
1094392_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own and lease facilities for engineering, sales and service related purposes in the United States and six other countries China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Scotland.
1094392_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	The following table indicates the location, the general purpose and the square footage of our principal facilities.
1094392_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	The expiration years of the leases covering the leased facilities are also indicated.
1094392_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	We also lease office space for other smaller sales and service offices in several locations throughout the world.
1094392_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our existing facilities and capital equipment are adequate to meet our current requirements, and that suitable additional or substitute space is available on commercially reasonable terms if needed.
1094392_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business.
1094392_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	As previously disclosed, in December 2007, we completed our acquisition of specific assets and liabilities of the semiconductor division of Applied Precision LLC ( Applied ).
1094392_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	As a result of the acquisition, we assumed certain liabilities of Applied including a lawsuit filed by Integrated Technology Corporation ( ITC ) which alleged Applied s PrecisionPoint and PrecisionWoRx products infringed an ITC patent.
1094392_12_ITEM3_P1_S2	Prior to trial, the judge found that our products made prior to August of 2007 infringed the ITC patent.
1094392_12_ITEM3_P1_S3	In December 2011, a trial verdict was rendered in the United States District Court, District of Arizona in which the jury found that while our products manufactured after August of 2007 did not literally infringe ITC s patent, the products were found to infringe under a rule known as the doctrine of equivalents, a legal principle which expands the language of patent claims to encompass products or processes which may otherwise be found not to literally infringe the patent.
1094392_12_ITEM3_P1_S4	The jury awarded $15.5 million to ITC in damages for the years 2000-2011.
1094392_12_ITEM3_P1_S5	The jury also found that for sales made after August of 2007, the infringement was willful.
1094392_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	The verdict and damages assessment are subject to post-trial motions and filings and further court review and rulings, which could potentially result in an increase or decrease in the damages award.
1094392_12_ITEM3_P3_S0	As this litigation is still ongoing, we believe that we have meritorious defenses and shall continue to vigorously defend the action.
1094392_12_ITEM3_P3_S1	With that, it is reasonably possible that we could realize a loss in this matter related to products made after August of 2007 such that in the event that we are ultimately found liable, damage estimates related to this case, which have not been accrued for as of December 31, 2011, range from approximately $25 thousand to $23.4 million, depending on multiple factors presented by the parties.
1094392_12_ITEM3_P3_S2	With regard to products made before August of 2007, it is probable that we could realize a loss in this matter for which we have estimated its potential liability to be $4.3 million, which we accrued as of December 31, 2011.
1094392_12_ITEM3_P3_S3	While we continue to believe that our current PrecisionPoint and ProbeWoRx systems do not infringe ITC s patent, we have removed from all of our future tools the predictive scrub feature that was found to be at issue in the litigation.
1094392_12_ITEM3_P4_S0	In our patent infringement suit against Camtek, Ltd., of Migdal Hamek, Israel, concerning our proprietary continuous scan wafer inspection technology, the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals issued a ruling on August 22, 2011.
1094392_12_ITEM3_P4_S1	In its opinion, the Appellate Court affirmed multiple rulings from trial at the District Court level including (i) finding our U.S.
1094392_12_ITEM3_P4_S2	Patent No. 6,826,298 valid, (ii) the part of the infringement ruling based on the finding that Camtek s Falcon product strobes based on velocity, and (iii) the dismissal of Camtek s claim against us for inequitable conduct against the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
1094392_12_ITEM3_P4_S3	The court did, however, revise one claim construction ruling made by the District Court in the original case.
1094392_12_ITEM3_P4_S4	As a result, the Appellate Court set aside the verdict delivered by the jury for damages and the District Court s decision to enter an injunction against Camtek s selling Falcon tools in the U.S. and remanded the case back to the trial court for a limited trial on this the single infringement issue.
1094392_12_ITEM3_P4_S5	No trial date has been set for this limited trial.
1094392_12_ITEM3_P5_S0	This lawsuit was initially brought in 2005 by August Technology prior to its merger with us.

1094392_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	The graph assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2006 in the Company s Common Stock and in each index, and that all dividends were reinvested.
1094392_12_ITEM5_P1_S1	No cash dividends have been declared or paid on the Company s Common Stock.
1094392_12_ITEM5_P1_S2	Stockholder returns over the indicated period should not be considered indicative of future stockholder returns.
1094392_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	The Company operates on a 52-week calendar year.
1094392_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sale prices per share of our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
1094392_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	As of February 16, 2012 , there were 86 stockholders of record of our common stock and approximately 4,560 beneficial stockholders.
1094392_12_ITEM5_P4_S1	The closing market value of our common stock on February 16, 2012 was $10.78 .
1094392_12_ITEM5_P4_S2	We have never declared or paid a cash dividend on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1094392_12_ITEM5_P4_S3	We currently intend to retain our earnings, if any, for the development of our business.
1094392_12_ITEM5_P4_S4	The declaration of any future dividends by us is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements as well as any other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
1094392_12_ITEM5_P5_S0	In July 2008 , our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 3 million shares of our common stock.
1094392_12_ITEM5_P5_S1	As of the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not purchased any shares under this program.

1094392_12_ITEM6_P1_S1	The balance sheet data as of December 31, 2010 and 2011 and the statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2009 , 2010 and 2011 set forth below were derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1094392_12_ITEM6_P1_S2	The balance sheet data as of 2007 , 2008 and 2009 , and the statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008 were derived from our audited consolidated financial statements not included herein.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview We are a worldwide leader in the design, development, manufacture and support of high-performance defect inspection, process control metrology and data analysis systems used by semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	We provide yield management solutions used in both wafer processing and final manufacturing through a family of standalone systems for both macro-defect inspection and transparent and opaque thin film measurements.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	All of these systems feature production-worthy automation and are backed by worldwide customer support.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	On August 3, 2009, we announced that we had acquired Adventa Control Technologies, Inc. ( Adventa ), headquartered in Plano, Texas.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	The acquired business is currently known as the Rudolph Technologies Process Control Group ( PCG ) and has been integrated into our Data Analysis and Review group of product offerings.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	On August 11, 2010, we announced that we had acquired selected assets of the Yield Dynamics software business ( YDI ) from MKS Instruments, headquartered in Andover, Massachusetts.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	The acquired business has been integrated into our Data Analysis and Review group of product offerings.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Rudolph s business is affected by the annual spending patterns of our customers on semiconductor capital equipment.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	The amount that our customers devote to capital equipment spending depends on a number of factors, including general worldwide economic conditions as well as other economic drivers such as personal computer, tablet, cell phone, other personal electronic devices and automotive sales.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	Current forecasts by industry analysts for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry project a year-over-year decrease in capital spending of 5-15% for 2012.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our revenues and profitability, tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	We monitor capital equipment spending through announced capital spending plans by our customers and monthly-published industry data such as the book-to-bill ratio.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	The book-to-bill ratio is a 3-month running statistic that compares bookings or orders placed with capital equipment suppliers to billings or shipments.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	A book-to-bill ratio above 1.0 shows that semiconductor device equipment manufacturers are ordering equipment at a pace that exceeds the equipment suppliers shipments for the period.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P4_S4	The three month rolling average North American semiconductor equipment book-to-bill ratio was 0.9 for the month of December 2011 , increasing from the September 2011 book-to-bill ratio of 0.7 .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Historically, a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers, and we expect this trend to continue.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2009 , 2010 and 2011 , sales to customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for 44.8% , 44.4% , and 43.6% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2009 , sales to Intel Corporation accounted for 13.6% of our revenues.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P5_S3	In 2010 , sales to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Semiconductor, Inc. accounted for 13.9% and 11.2% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P5_S4	In 2011, sales to Infineon Technologies and Samsung Semiconductor Inc. accounted for 13.5% and 12.1% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P5_S5	We do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products, and they could cease purchasing products from us at any time.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P5_S6	A delay in purchase or cancellation by any of our large customers could cause quarterly revenues to vary significantly.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P5_S7	In addition, during a given quarter, a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P5_S8	Our macro-defect inspection and probe card and test analysis systems range in average selling price from approximately $250,000 to $1.7 million per system, our transparent film measurement systems range in average selling price from approximately $250,000 to $1.0 million per system and our opaque film measurement systems range in average selling price from approximately $1.0 million to $2.0 million million per system.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P5_S9	A significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customers outside of the United States.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P5_S10	We expect that revenues generated from customers outside of the United States will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	The following table lists, for the periods indicated, the revenue derived from customers outside of the United States (in percentages of total revenues):
1094392_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	The sales cycle for our systems typically ranges from six to 15 months, and can be longer when our customers are evaluating new technology.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	Due to the length of these cycles, we invest significantly in research and development and sales and marketing in advance of generating revenues related to these investments.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our statements of operations data as percentages of our revenues.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	Our results of operations are reported as one business segment.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Results of Operations 2009 , 2010 and 2011 Revenues .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our revenues are derived from the sale of our systems, services, spare parts and software licensing.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	Our revenues were $78.7 million , $195.3 million and $187.2 million for the years ended 2009 , 2010 and 2011 , respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P9_S3	This represents an increase of 148.3% from 2009 to 2010 and a decrease of 4.1% from 2010 to 2011 .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P9_S4	The increase in revenue from 2009 to 2010 is primarily due to improving economic conditions leading to increased capital spending in the semiconductor industry.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P9_S5	The decrease in revenue from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to a decrease in revenue during the second half of 2011 as some customers delayed purchases due to changes in demands for their products and uncertainty in the global economy.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	The following table lists, for the periods indicated, the different sources of our revenues in dollars (thousands) and as percentages of our total revenues:
1094392_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Systems and software revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 due to improving economic conditions leading to increased capital spending in the semiconductor industry.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	This contributed to an increase in the number of systems sold from 2009 to 2010 .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	These changes in systems revenue reflect an increase in inspection systems revenue of $67.9 million and an increase in metrology systems revenue of $30.5 million .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	The year-over-year increase in data analysis and review software revenues of $12.7 million from 2009 to 2010 is primarily due to revenue from PCG, which was acquired in August 2009.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P11_S4	The average selling price of similarly configured systems has been relatively consistent and therefore did not have a material impact on our revenue for the same period.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P11_S5	As a result, the increase in revenue from the 2009 period as compared to the 2010 period was caused by increased volume rather than pricing changes.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P11_S6	Systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to 35% of total revenue for 2009 compared to 59% of total revenue for 2010 .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P11_S7	The year-over-year increase in parts and service revenues in absolute dollars from 2009 to 2010 is primarily due to increased spending by our customers on repairs of existing systems.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P11_S8	Parts and services revenues are generated from part sales, maintenance service contracts, system upgrades, as well as time and material billable service calls.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P11_S9	Total systems and software revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 due to a slow down in system sales in the second half of 2011as our customers delayed purchases due to changes in demands for their products and uncertainty in the global economy.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P11_S10	This contributed to decreases in the number of inspection and metrology systems sold year-over-year and reflects decreases in inspection systems revenue of $14.1 million and metrology systems revenue of $0.8 million .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P11_S11	The year-over-year increase in data analysis and review software revenues of $3.9 million from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to increased sales across all data analysis and review software product families.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P11_S12	The average selling price of similarly configured systems has been consistent and therefore did not have a material impact on our revenue for the same period.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P11_S13	Systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to 59% of total revenue for 2010 compared to 55% of total revenue for 2011 .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P11_S14	The year-over-year increase in parts and service revenues in absolute dollars from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to increased spending by our customers on repairs of existing systems.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P11_S15	Parts and services revenues are generated from part sales, maintenance service contracts, system upgrades, as well as time and material billable service calls.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P11_S16	Deferred revenues of $7.3 million are recorded in Other current liabilities at December 31, 2011 and primarily consist of $5.2 million for deferred maintenance agreements and $2.1 million for systems awaiting acceptance and outstanding deliverables.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P11_S17	Our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including manufacturing efficiencies, excess and obsolete inventory write-offs, pricing by competitors or suppliers, new product introductions, production volume, customization and reconfiguration of systems, international and domestic sales mix, and parts and service margins.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P11_S18	Our gross profit was $28.9 million , $103.9 million and $100.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 , 2010 and 2011 , respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	and lower reserves due to better inventory utilization.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to product mix, which included an increase in software sales.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	We do not track gross margin by the sources of revenue.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	The macro-defect inspection, thin film transparent, opaque process control, and probe card test analysis market is characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	We believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements of existing products, including the transition to copper and low-k dielectrics, wafer level packaging, the continuous shrinkage in critical dimensions, and the evolution of ultra-thin gate process control, is critical to our success.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our technical, management and financial resources to research and development programs.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	Research and development expenditures consist primarily of salaries and related expenses of employees engaged in research, design and development activities.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P15_S4	They also include consulting fees, the cost of related supplies and legal costs to defend our patents.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P15_S5	Our research and development expense was $26.0 million , $33.4 million and $36.3 million in 2009 , 2010 and 2011 , respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P15_S6	The year-over-year dollar increase from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to higher costs related to compensation, projects and litigation, as well as, the inclusion of engineering costs associated with the YDI acquisition in the third quarter of 2010.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P15_S7	The year-over-year dollar increase from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to higher compensation costs, increased patent litigation costs, and the inclusion of a full year of research and development expense of the YDI acquisition completed in the third quarter of 2010.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	We continue to maintain our commitment to investing in new product development and enhancement to existing products in order to position ourselves for future growth.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs for sales, marketing, and general administrative personnel, as well as commissions and other non-personnel related expenses.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	Our selling, general and administrative expense was $32.7 million , $38.2 million and $40.8 million in 2009 , 2010 and 2011 , respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	The year-over-year increase from 2009 through 2011 in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily due to incremental higher compensation and corporate legal expenses.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	In 2009 and 2010 , net interest income was $0.3 million and $0.2 million , respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P17_S4	In 2011 , net interest expense was $1.9 million .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P17_S5	The year-over-year decrease in net interest income for 2009 and 2010 was primarily due to lower average interest rates in 2010.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P17_S6	The year-over-year increase in net interest expense for 2011 was primarily due to interest expense related to the convertible senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2011.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P17_S7	In 2009 and 2010 , net other expense was $0.9 million and $0.3 million , respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P17_S8	In 2011 , net other income was $0.8 million .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P17_S9	The year-over-year dollar changes in net other income (expense) were primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P17_S10	We recorded an income tax benefit of $2.2 million and $4.8 million , in 2009 and 2011 , respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P17_S11	Income tax expense was $3.5 million in 2010 .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P17_S12	The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $2.2 million or 7.0% of loss before benefit for income taxes.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P17_S13	The income tax benefit differs from the amount that would result from applying the federal statutory income tax rate of 35% to our loss before benefit for income taxes, primarily due to valuation allowances in taxable jurisdictions.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $3.5 million or 11.5% of income before provision for income taxes.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	This differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 35%, primarily as a result of projected tax payments in U.S. and foreign locations, offset by valuation allowances.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $4.8 million or (23.7)% of income before provision for income taxes.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P18_S3	The income tax benefit differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 35%, primarily as a result of reversal of valuation allowances, partially offset by projected tax payments in U.S. and foreign locations.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	We evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets from future taxable income and establish valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	We consider available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	At December 31, 2010 and 2011 , we had valuation allowances of $37.2 million and $24.7 million on certain of our deferred tax assets to reflect the deferred tax asset at the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P19_S3	The decrease in valuation allowance of $12.6 million is primary due to a partial release of the tax valuation allowance of $8.4 million .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P19_S4	The Company evaluated the realizability of the deferred tax asset based on positive earnings from 2010 and 2011 as well as the projected earnings in future years and believes it is more likely than not that a partial amount of the deferred tax asset will be realized in the future years.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P19_S5	The Company will continue to monitor the realizability of the deferred tax asset and evaluate the valuation allowance.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	As discussed in Item 3 ( Legal Proceedings ), the Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims, which includes, among other things, its on-going litigation with ITC.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	Management cannot determine whether its potential losses with ITC discussed in Item 3 are reasonably likely to occur.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	In the event that the ultimate decision in the ITC Litigation results in a judgment of damages against the Company at the high end of the identified ranges, such result is likely to have a material impact on the Company s results of operations and may also have a material impact on the Company s liquidity and financial condition.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2010 , our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $71.7 million , while working capital amounted to $159.7 million .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	At December 31, 2011 , we had $167.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $234.2 million in working capital.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Typically during periods of revenue growth, changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a use of cash as we incur costs and expend cash in advance of receiving cash from our customers.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	Similarly, during periods of declining revenue, changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a source of cash as inventory purchases decline and revenue from prior periods is collected.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	Net cash and cash equivalents used by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $12.1 million .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P22_S3	Net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011 totaled $16.3 million and $45.4 million , respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P22_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2009 , cash used by operating activities was primarily due to net loss, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, of $11.7 million , an increase in accounts receivable of 13.0 million , a decrease in other current liabilities of $1.3 million and a decrease in accrued liabilities of $1.2 million , partially offset by a decrease in inventories of $6.9 million , an increase in accounts payable of $3.2 million , an increase in non-current liabilities of $2.0 million , an increase in deferred revenue of $1.6 million and a decrease in income taxes receivable $1.0 million .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P22_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2010 , cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, of $37.1 million , an increase in accrued liabilities of $2.7 million , a decrease in income tax receivable of $2.3 million , an increase in accounts payable of $2.2 million , an increase in deferred revenue of $0.9 million , and increase in other current liabilities of $0.8 million , partially offset by an increase of accounts receivable of $23.4 million and an increase of inventories of $5.6 million .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P22_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2011 , cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, of $28.9 million , a decrease of accounts receivable of $18.0 million , an increase in other current liabilities of $5.7 million , an increase in non-current liabilities of $1.5 million , and an increase in accrued liabilities of $1.1 million , partially offset by an increase in prepaid and other assets of $4.4 million , a decrease in accounts payable of $3.4 million , an increase in deferred revenue of $1.3 million , and a decrease in income tax receivable of $0.5 million .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Investing activities provided $1.7 million of net cash and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2009.

1094392_12_ITEM7_P23_S5	Capital expenditures over the next twelve months are expected to be approximately $6.0 million to $8.0 million .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P23_S6	Net cash provided by financing activities was $0.2 million , $0.5 million and $51.0 million in 2009 , 2010 and 2011 , respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P23_S7	In the 2009 period, net cash provided by financing activities was a result of proceeds received from sales of shares through share-based compensation plans.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P23_S8	In the 2010 period, net cash provided by financing activities comprised proceeds received from sales of shares through share-based compensation plans of $0.3 million and tax benefit from share-based compensation plans of $0.2 million .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P23_S9	In the 2011 period, net cash provided by financing activities comprised net proceeds from the issuance of 3.75% convertible senior notes of $57.7 million , proceeds from the sale of a warrant of $7.0 million , tax benefit from employee stock plans of $0.5 million and proceeds received for sales of shares through share-based compensation plans of $0.3 million , partially offset by the purchase of the convertible note hedge of $14.5 million .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	From time to time we evaluate whether to acquire new or complementary businesses, products and/or technologies.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	We may fund all or a portion of the purchase price of these acquisitions in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	In July 2008 , our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to 3 million shares of Company common stock.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	As of the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not purchased any shares under this program.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	On July 25, 2011 , we issued $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% convertible senior notes, which mature on July 15, 2016 and pay interest semiannually commencing on January 15, 2012 .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P25_S3	In connection with the issuance, we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P25_S4	The convertible note hedge transaction is intended to reduce potential dilution in our common stock upon conversion of the notes.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P25_S5	However, the warrant transaction will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrant.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P25_S6	Net proceeds realized from the sale of the convertible senior notes, the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions were $50.2 million .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P25_S7	We intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include financing potential acquisitions and strategic transactions, growth initiatives and working capital.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P25_S8	For additional information, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and amount of our revenues and our investment decisions, which will affect our ability to generate additional cash.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P25_S9	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for the next twelve months.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P25_S10	Thereafter, if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements, we may seek additional funding through bank borrowings, sales of securities or other means.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P25_S11	There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us or at all.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2011 , and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	This table excludes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits that totaled approximately $8.5 million at December 31, 2011 .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	We are currently unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount or periods when cash settlement of this liability may occur.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	The Company does not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity and capital resources.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	Critical Accounting Policies Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	We review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P28_S3	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, business acquisitions, intangible assets, share-based payments, income taxes and warranty obligations.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P28_S4	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P28_S5	Results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P28_S6	These estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis, and by the Audit Committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P28_S7	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	In October 2009, the FASB also amended the accounting standards for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements to:
1094392_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices ( ESP ) of deliverables if it does not have vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) or third-party evidence ( TPE ) of selling price.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Valuation terms are defined as follows:
1094392_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	VSOE - the price at which we sell the element in a separate stand-alone transaction.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	TPE - evidence from us or other companies of the value of a largely interchangeable element in a transaction.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	ESP - our best estimate of the selling price of an element in a transaction.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	We adopted this accounting guidance on January 1, 2011.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	The implementation resulted in additional qualitative disclosures that are included below but did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	The adoption of the new standards did not change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P36_S3	Revenue is recognized provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P36_S4	Revenue recognition generally results at the following points: (1) for all transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment for all products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment; the portion of revenue associated with certain installation-related tasks is deferred, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation-related tasks; (2) for products that have not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized at customer technical acceptance; (3) for transactions which have occurred prior to January 1, 2011, revenue for arrangements with multiple elements, such as sales of products that include software and services, was allocated to each element using the residual method based on the fair value of the undelivered items as determined using the prior guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P36_S5	Under the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements; (4) for transactions occurring on or after January 1, 2011 containing multiple elements, the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred using the relative selling price method utilizing VSOE or estimated sales prices until delivery of the deferred elements.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	TPE is not typically used to determine selling prices as to limited availability of reliable competitor products selling prices.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	The ESP is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, gross margin objectives, internal costs and competitor pricing strategies.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Revenues from parts sales are recognized at the time of shipment.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	Revenue from training and service contracts is recognized ratably over the training period and contract period.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	A provision for the estimated cost of fulfilling warranty obligations is recorded at the time the related revenue is recognized.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P39_S3	Revenue from software license fees is recognized upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and vendor-specific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P39_S4	License support and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	We specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if our assumptions are otherwise incorrect, additional allowances may be required.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	We write down our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product life-cycles, product demand and market conditions.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	If actual product life-cycles, product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those originally projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	We account for acquired or merged businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition or merger at their respective fair values.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	Accordingly, for significant acquisitions, we typically obtain assistance from independent valuation specialists.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	There are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	For intangible assets, we normally utilize the income method.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the projected future cash flows (including timing) and the discount rate reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flows.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	For example, different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	All of these judgments and estimates can significantly impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P46_S3	Our formal annual impairment testing date for goodwill is October 31 st or prior to the next annual testing date if an event occurs or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process which requires us to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	The first step consists of estimating the fair value of our aggregated reporting unit using the market value of our common stock at October 31 st , multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares (market capitalization) and an implied control premium as if it were to be acquired by a single stockholder.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	We obtain information on completed sales of similar companies in a comparable industry to estimate an implied control premium for us.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	We compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value which includes goodwill.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P48_S3	If the results of the initial market capitalization test produce results which are below the reporting unit carrying value, we will also consider if the market capitalization is temporarily low and, if so, we may also perform a discounted cash flow test.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the second step is completed to compute the impairment amount by determining the implied fair value of goodwill.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	This determination requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	Any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill which is compared to the corresponding carrying value to compute the goodwill impairment amount.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	Long-Lived Assets and Acquired Intangible Assets.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	We periodically review long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and the impairment of such long-lived assets, if any, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	No such indicators were noted in 2011 .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	The fair value of our stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	The Black-Scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility, expected terms, risk-free rates and dividend yield.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	We use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	The expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options, and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	We have never paid cash dividends, and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends, and thus have assumed a 0% dividend yield.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	If our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share-based compensation cost, or if different assumptions had been used, we may have recorded too much or too little share-based compensation cost.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our share grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P55_S3	If the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	While we engage in product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P56_S2	Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P57_S3	Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	The need for a valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred taxes will be recoverable.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, we may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	At December 31, 2010 and 2011 , we had valuation allowances of $37.2 million and $24.7 million on certain of our deferred tax assets to reflect the deferred tax asset at the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P58_S3	The decrease in valuation allowance of $12.6 million is primary due to a partial release of the tax valuation allowance of $8.4 million .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P58_S4	The Company evaluated the realizability of the deferred tax asset based on positive earnings from 2010 and 2011 as well as the projected earnings in future years and believes it is more likely than not that a partial amount of the deferred tax asset will be realized in the future years.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P58_S5	The Company will continue to monitor the realizability of the deferred tax asset and evaluate the valuation allowance.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	The first step requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that the tax position has met the threshold for recognition; therefore, we must evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P59_S2	The second step requires us to measure the tax benefit of the tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized when effectively settled.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P59_S3	This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P59_S4	We reevaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues, and new audit activity.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P59_S5	Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P59_S6	Although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P59_S7	If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, it could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	The ASU is to defer only those changes in ASU No. 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	The amendments are being made to allow the Board time to redeliberate whether to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P60_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P60_S3	We do not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	The ASU will require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P61_S3	We do not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, result of operations, or cash flows.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	The ASU is to simplify how entities, both public and non public, test goodwill for impairment.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P62_S2	The amendments in the ASU permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two -step goodwill impairment test described in Topic 350.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	This ASU is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P63_S2	We do not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	The ASU is to improve the comparability, consistency, and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income and to facilitate convergence of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
1094392_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	The FASB decided to eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity, among other amendments in this ASU.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P64_S3	This ASU should be applied retrospectively, and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P64_S4	We do not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, as it is disclosure-only in nature.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	The ASU will improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P65_S2	This ASU is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P65_S3	We do not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, as it is disclosure-only in nature.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance related to Business Combinations.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	The amendments affect any public entity that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	The amendments specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P66_S3	The amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P66_S4	The amendments are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	The amendment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	In April 2010 , the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-13, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), which provides guidance on the classification of a share-based payment award as either equity or a liability.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	A share-based payment award that contains a condition that is not a market, performance, or service condition is required to be classified as a liability.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2010 .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	We adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2011 and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	This ASU requires new disclosures regarding significant transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2, and information about activity in Level 3 fair value measurements.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P70_S2	In addition, this ASU clarifies existing disclosures regarding input and valuation techniques, as well as the level of disaggregation for each class of assets and liabilities.
1094392_12_ITEM7_P70_S3	This ASU was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009 , except for certain Level 3 activity disclosure requirements, which were effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010 .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P70_S4	We adopted the new guidance in the first quarter of 2010 , except for the disclosures related to purchases, sales, issuance and settlements, which became effective on January 1, 2011 .
1094392_12_ITEM7_P70_S5	The adoption of this guidance, which affects new disclosures only, did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as it is disclosure-only in nature.
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate and Credit Market Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates and market liquidity including our investments in certain available-for-sale securities and our convertible senior notes.
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our available-for-sale securities consist of fixed and variable rate income investments (Municipal notes, bonds and an auction rate security).
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates, market liquidity and credit ratings of issuers from our available-for-sale securities.
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	It is possible that we are at risk if interest rates, market liquidity or credit ratings of issuers change in an unfavorable direction.
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The magnitude of any gain or loss will be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our financial investments held as of December 31, 2011 , an immediate adverse change of 10% in interest rates (e.g. 3.00% to 3.30%) would result in an immaterial decrease in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities.
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P0_S6	The interest rate on our convertible senior notes is fixed.
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Therefore, any change in interest rates will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Foreign Currency Risk We have branch operations in Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea and wholly-owned subsidiaries in Europe, Japan and China.
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our international subsidiaries and branches operate primarily using local functional currencies.
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	These foreign branches and subsidiaries are limited in their operations and level of investment so that the risk of currency fluctuations is not material.
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P1_S3	A hypothetical 10% appreciation or depreciation in the U.S. dollar relative to the reporting currencies of our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 would have affected the foreign-currency-denominated non-operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries by approximately $1.2 million .
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	A substantial portion of our international systems sales are denominated in U.S. dollars with the exception of Japan and, as a result, we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these sales.
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Substantially all our sales in Japan are denominated in Japanese yen.
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	From time to time, we may enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within 12 months.
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The change in fair value of the forward contracts is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations each reporting period.
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P3_S2	As of December 31, 2010 and 2011 , we had twenty and twenty-six forward contracts outstanding, respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P3_S3	The total notional contract value of these outstanding forward contracts at December 31, 2010 and 2011 was $2.2 million and $2.7 million , respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1094392_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	The consolidated financial statements required by this item are set forth on the pages indicated at Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1094392_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) is recorded , processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in SEC rules and forms.
1094392_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, we have recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1094392_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management is required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures.
1094392_12_ITEM9A_P1_S2	We performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, to assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2011 .
1094392_12_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Based on that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2011 at the reasonable assurance level.
1094392_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
1094392_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1094392_12_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
1094392_12_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011 .
1094392_12_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements .
1094392_12_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1094392_12_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011 have been audited by Ernst Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

1094392_12_ITEM15_P7_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

1094392_12_ITEM15_P12_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

1094392_12_ITEM15_P13_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1094392_12_ITEM15_P19_S0	Organization and Nature of Operations: Rudolph Technologies, Inc. (the Company ) designs, develops, manufactures and supports high-performance process control equipment used in semiconductor device manufacturing.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P19_S1	The Company has branch sales and service offices in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore and wholly-owned sales and service subsidiaries in Europe, Japan, China and Minnesota.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P19_S2	The Company operates in a single segment and is a provider of process characterization equipment and software for wafer fabs and advanced packaging facilities.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P20_S0	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: A. Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P20_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P21_S0	In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P21_S1	In October 2009, the FASB also amended the accounting standards for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements to:
1094392_12_ITEM15_P22_S0	require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices ( ESP ) of deliverables if it does not have vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) or third-party evidence ( TPE ) of selling price.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P23_S0	Valuation terms are defined as follows:
1094392_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	VSOE - the price at which the Company sells the element in a separate stand-alone transaction.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	TPE - evidence from the Company or other companies of the value of a largely interchangeable element in a transaction.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	ESP - the Company s best estimate of the selling price of an element in a transaction.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	The Company adopted this accounting guidance on January 1, 2011.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P27_S1	The implementation resulted in additional qualitative disclosures that are included below but did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	The adoption of the new standards did not change the units of accounting for the Company s revenue transactions.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	Revenue is recognized provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	Under the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements; (4) for transactions occurring on or after January 1, 2011 containing multiple elements, the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred using the relative selling price method utilizing VSOE or estimated sales prices until delivery of the deferred elements.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P30_S0	TPE is not typically used to determine selling prices as to limited availability of reliable competitor products selling prices.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	The ESP is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, gross margin objectives, internal costs and competitor pricing strategies.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	Revenues from parts sales are recognized at the time of shipment.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P32_S1	Revenue from training and service contracts is recognized ratably over the training period and contract period.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P32_S2	A provision for the estimated cost of fulfilling warranty obligations is recorded at the time the related revenue is recognized.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P32_S3	Revenue from software license fees is recognized upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and vendor-specific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P32_S4	License support and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	C. Estimates : The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P33_S1	Significant estimates made by management include allowance for doubtful accounts , inventory obsolescence, purchase accounting allocations, recoverability and useful lives of property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets, recoverability of goodwill, recoverability of deferred tax assets, liabilities for product warranty, accruals for manufacturing consolidation, contingencies and share-based payments, including forfeitures and liabilities for tax uncertainties.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P33_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	D. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include cash and highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased .
1094392_12_ITEM15_P34_S1	E. Marketable Securities: The Company determined that all of its investment securities are to be classified as available-for-sale.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P34_S2	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity under the caption Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P34_S3	Realized gains and losses, interest and dividends on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income and other, net.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	Available-for-sale securities are classified as current assets regardless of their maturity date if they are available for use in current operations.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	The Company reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, credit quality and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P36_S2	When a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities are charged against earnings.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	The specific identification method is used to determine the gains and losses on marketable securities.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P37_S1	For additional information on the Company s marketable securities, see Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	F. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P38_S1	In the cases where the Company is aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligation, the Company records a specific allowance against amounts due, and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount management reasonably believes will be collected.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P38_S2	For all other customers, the Company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are outstanding, industry and geographic concentrations, the current business environment and historical experience.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	G. Inventories : Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P39_S1	Cost includes material, labor and overhead costs.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P39_S2	Demonstration units , which are available for sale, are stated at their manufacturing costs and reserves are recorded to adjust the demonstration units to their net realizable value, if lower than cost.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	H. Property , Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P40_S1	Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which are thirty years for buildings, four to seven years for machinery and equipment, seven years for furniture and fixtures, and three years for computer equipment.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P40_S2	Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related asset.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P40_S3	Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and major renewals and betterments are capitalized.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	I. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and identifiable acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P42_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P42_S1	If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is generally based on discounted cash flows.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P43_S0	J. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Intangible assets with definitive useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P43_S1	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually and when there are indications of impairment.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P44_S0	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P44_S1	The Company estimates the fair value of its aggregated reporting unit using the market value of its common stock at October 31 multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares (market capitalization) and an implied control premium as if it were to be acquired by a single stockholder.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P44_S2	The Company obtains information on completed sales of similar companies in the related industry to estimate the implied control premium for the Company.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	If the results of the initial market capitalization test produce results which are below the reporting unit carrying value, the Company may also perform a discounted cash flow test.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	The Company tested for goodwill impairment on October 31, 2011 .
1094392_12_ITEM15_P46_S1	For additional information on the Company s other intangible assets, see Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	K. Concentration of Credit Risk: Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.

1094392_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	M. Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach for deferred taxes which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company s consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce a deferred tax asset to that portion which more likely than not will be realized.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P50_S1	Additionally, taxes are separated into current and non-current amounts based on the classification of the related amounts for financial reporting purposes.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P50_S2	The Company does not provide for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign operations as it is the Company s intention to permanently re-invest undistributed earnings.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P50_S3	The impact of an uncertain income tax position is recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority and includes consideration of interest and penalties.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P50_S4	An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P50_S5	The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified as non-current unless the liability is expected to be settled in cash within 12 months of the reporting date.

1094392_12_ITEM15_P51_S2	These foreign branches and subsidiaries are limited in their operations and level of investment so that the risk of currency fluctuations is not material .
1094392_12_ITEM15_P51_S3	A substantial portion of the Company s international systems sales are denominated in U.S. dollars with the exception of Japan and, as a result, it has relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these sales.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P51_S4	Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and income and expense accounts and cash flow items are translated at average monthly exchange rates during the period.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P51_S5	Net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements and the effect of exchange rates on intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature are recorded directly as a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption, Accumulated other comprehensive loss.

1094392_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	O. Share-based Compensation : The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P52_S1	The Black-Scholes valuation calculation requires the Company to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility, expected terms, risk-free interest rates and dividend yield.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company s stock.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P53_S1	The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P53_S2	The expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options, and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P53_S3	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P53_S4	The Company has never paid cash dividends, and does not currently intend to pay cash dividends, and thus has assumed a 0% dividend yield.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P53_S5	Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires significant judgment.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P54_S1	The Company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P54_S2	Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from the Company s current estimates.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	Compensation expense for all share-based payments includes an estimate for forfeitures and is recognized over the expected term of the share-based awards using the straight-line method.

1094392_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	P. Research and Development and Software Development Costs: Expenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P57_S0	Certain software product development costs incurred after technological feasibility has been established are capitalized and amortized, commencing upon the general release of the software product to the Company s customers, over the economic life of the software product.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P57_S1	Annual amortization of capitalized costs is computed using the greater of: (i) the ratio of current gross revenues for the software product over the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for the software product or (ii) the straight-line basis, typically over seven years.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P57_S2	Software product development costs incurred prior to the product reaching technological feasibility are expensed as incurred and included in research and development costs.

1094392_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	Q. Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P58_S1	The carrying amount and fair value of our convertible senior notes was $46,524 as of December 31, 2011 .
1094392_12_ITEM15_P58_S2	The Company s convertible senior notes are not publicly traded.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	The estimated fair value of these obligations is based, primarily, on a market approach, comparing the Company s interest rates to those rates the Company believes it would reasonably receive upon re-entry into the market.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P59_S1	Judgment is required to estimate the fair value, using available market information and appropriate valuation methods.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	R. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities: The Company, when it considers it to be appropriate, enters into forward contracts to hedge the economic exposures arising from foreign currency denominated transactions.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P60_S1	At December 31, 2010 and 2011 , these contracts included the future sale of Japanese Yen to purchase U.S. dollars.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P60_S2	The foreign currency forward contracts were entered into by the Company s Japanese subsidiary to hedge a portion of certain intercompany obligations.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P60_S3	The forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and therefore, the change in fair value is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	The dollar equivalent of the U.S. dollar forward contracts and related fair values as of December 31, 2010 and 2011 were as follows:

1094392_12_ITEM15_P79_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P79_S1	Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P79_S2	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management s assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P80_S0	A financial asset s or liability s fair value measurement classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

1094392_12_ITEM15_P82_S1	The U.S. Treasury Notes and municipal notes and bonds are measured based on quoted market prices.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P82_S2	Level 2 investments are valued using observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.

1094392_12_ITEM15_P116_S4	The jury awarded $15,475 to ITC in damages for the years 2000-2011.

1094392_12_ITEM15_P119_S2	The court did, however, revise one claim construction ruling made by the District Court in the original case.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P119_S3	As a result, the Appellate Court set aside the verdict delivered by the jury for damages and the District Court s decision to enter an injunction against Camtek s selling Falcon tools in the U.S. and remanded the case back to the trial court for a limited trial on this the single infringement issue.

1094392_12_ITEM15_P140_S0	The components of income tax expense are as follows:
1094392_12_ITEM15_P141_S0	Income (loss) before income tax of $(32,123) and $256 was generated by domestic and foreign operations, respectively, in 2009 .
1094392_12_ITEM15_P141_S1	Income before income tax of $16,284 and $14,253 was generated by domestic and foreign operations, respectively, in 2010 .
1094392_12_ITEM15_P141_S2	Income (loss) before income tax of $23,963 and $(3,569) was generated by domestic and foreign operations, respectively, in 2011 .
1094392_12_ITEM15_P141_S3	The income tax benefit of $(9,018) in 2011 primarily resulted from benefits related to the release of valuation allowance recorded against U.S. deferred tax assets, partially offset by taxes accrued in both the U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P142_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised of the following:
1094392_12_ITEM15_P143_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2011 , we had valuation allowances of $37,239 and $24,674 on certain of our deferred tax assets to reflect the deferred tax asset at the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P143_S1	The decrease in valuation allowance of $12,565 is primarily due to a partial release of the tax valuation allowance of $8,444 .
1094392_12_ITEM15_P143_S2	The Company evaluated the realizability of the deferred tax asset based on positive earnings from 2010 and 2011 as well as the projected earnings in future years and believes it is more likely than not that a partial amount of the deferred tax asset will be realized in the future years.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P143_S3	The Company will continue to monitor the realizability of the deferred tax asset and evaluate the valuation allowance.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P144_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company uses a more-likely-than-not standard.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P144_S1	If it is determined that it is more-likely-than-not that deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against the deferred tax assets.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P145_S0	The ultimate realization of the assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences become deductible.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P145_S1	Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies when making this assessment.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P146_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% for the years ended December 31, 2009 , 2010 and 2011 to income before provision for income taxes as follows:
1094392_12_ITEM15_P147_S0	At December 31, 2011 , the Company had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $0 , $9,831 and $0 , respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P147_S1	The net operating loss carryforwards expire on various dates through December 31, 2029 .
1094392_12_ITEM15_P147_S2	At December 31, 2011 , the Company had federal and state research development credits and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $5,755 , $2,860 and $1,585 , respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P147_S3	The federal research development credits are set to expire at various dates through December 31, 2031 .
1094392_12_ITEM15_P147_S4	The state research development credits are set to expire at various dates through December 21, 2023 .
1094392_12_ITEM15_P147_S5	The foreign tax credit is set to expire at various dates through December 31, 2018 .
1094392_12_ITEM15_P148_S0	A provision has not been made at December 31, 2011 for U.S. or additional foreign withholding taxes on approximately $2,129 of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary in Europe because it is the present intention of management to permanently reinvest these undistributed earnings.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P148_S1	Upon distribution of those earnings, U.S. taxes on such permanently reinvested foreign earnings would be recorded net of applicable foreign tax credits and withholding taxes, if any.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P148_S2	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:
1094392_12_ITEM15_P149_S0	Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2010 and 2011 are unrecognized tax benefits of $6,724 and $8,476 , of which $4,731 and $6,118 , would be reflected as an adjustment to income tax expense if recognized, respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P149_S1	It is reasonably possible that certain amounts of unrecognized tax benefits may reverse in the next 12 months; however, we do not expect such reversals would have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P150_S0	The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P150_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2009 , 2010 and 2011 , the Company recognized approximately $16 , $27 and $330 in interest and penalties expense associated with uncertain tax positions, respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P150_S2	As of December 31, 2010 and 2011 , the Company had accrued interest and penalties expense related to unrecognized tax benefits of $214 and $566 , respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P151_S0	The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P151_S1	Presently, the Company is under a federal income tax examination by the Internal Revenue Service for examination of income tax returns for the tax years ended, December 31, 2007 through December 31, 2009 .

1094392_12_ITEM15_P159_S0	Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P159_S1	Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed in the same manner and also gives effect to all dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P159_S2	Potential common shares that would have the effect of increasing diluted earnings per share are considered to be antidilutive.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P159_S3	In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these shares were not included in calculating diluted earnings per share.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P159_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2009 , all outstanding stock options and restricted stock units were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share totaling 2,188 and 1,372 , respectively, because the effect in the period would be anti-dilutive.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P159_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2010 , the weighted average number of stock options and restricted stock units excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share were 2,059 and 446 , respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P159_S6	For the year ended December 31, 2011 , the weighted average number of stock options and restricted stock units excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share were 1,257 and 291 , respectively.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P159_S7	Diluted earnings per share-weighted average shares outstanding do not include any effect resulting from assumed conversion of the Notes and warrants (as described in Note 8) as their impact would be anti-dilutive.
1094392_12_ITEM15_P160_S0	The computations of basic and diluted income (loss) per share for the years ended December 31, 2009 , 2010 , and 2011 are as follows:
1094392_12_ITEM15_P161_S0	Share Repurchase Program In July 2008 , the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 3,000 shares of the Company s common stock.

1094392_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	Rudolph systems are backed by worldwide customer service and applications support.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	Two acquisitions in 2012 strengthened Rudolph's established presence in Integrated Circuit and Flat Panel Display ( FPD ) manufacturing by adding to its substantial intellectual property portfolio.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	In June, the Company acquired specific assets and liabilities of NanoPhotonics GmbH, Mainz, Germany ( NanoPhotonics acquisition ) and added unpatterned wafer inspection to its product offering.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	Wilmington, Massachusetts, ( Azores acquisition ) and announced entry into the advanced packaging and FPD lithography markets.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	Previous to the acquisition, Rudolph partnered with Azores (a manufacturer of lithography steppers for the FPD industry) to design and build a lithography stepper for the semiconductor advanced packaging market.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P3_S2	The first system shipped to a major Outsourced Assembly and Test ( OSAT ) customer in the fourth quarter of 2012.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	Rudolph s Meta PULSE Systems, used mainly for fast and accurate measurements of metal interconnect in front-end wafer processing applications, have now been chosen by back-end manufacturers to perform system measurements in new process applications, driven by the need for on-product metrology as feature sizes decrease and pattern densities increase.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	In addition, the new Meta PULSE FP system was selected by a major manufacturer of flat panel displays to measure critical thickness of metal layers deposited during the manufacturing process.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P4_S2	Multiple Rudolph systems continue to support 450mm wafer processing research and development.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P4_S3	Our latest-generation defect inspection and thin film metrology tools are designed to increase the value of inspection and metrology data to ensure improved process yields and profitability as the industry moves toward a full 450mm production ramp in the 2015 timeframe.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	Advanced Packaging is a key technology that enables the miniaturization of electronic products.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	In electronics manufacturing, integrated circuit packaging is the final stage of semiconductor device fabrication, in which the tiny block of semiconducting material (die) is encased in a supporting package that provides an external electrical connection and prevents physical damage and corrosion.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	Packaging refers loosely to the conductors and other structures that interconnect the circuits, feed them with electric power, discharge their heat, and protect them from damage.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	Today, the drive to pack more functions into a small space and reduce their power requirements demands that chip packages do much more than ever before.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P6_S3	Examples of advanced packaging are varied and include flip-chip bumping, pillar bumping, wafer-level chip scale packaging and 3D packaging.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	With each new generation of portable consumer devices such as smart phones and laptops, greater functionality as well as enhanced performance is required over the previous generation.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	At the same time, the space available for electrical and electronic components is very limited.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P7_S2	One solution using advanced packaging is the 3D integration of semiconductors and other devices.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P7_S3	The technology involves stacking individual die or wafers in one integrated housing.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P7_S4	Through silicon vias (TSV, 3D stacking) allow communication among the individual components.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P7_S5	This offers the advantages of shorter signal paths and reduced power consumption, enhanced bandwidths, integration of heterogeneous components such as sub-chips, smaller surface area and reduced expense.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P7_S6	The processes required for 3D integration are still being optimized for yield, and to ensure the functioning of individual microchips.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	The ongoing popularity of smart mobile devices is driven by the designed-in capability.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	These are no longer single function devices, but instead, various devices have been combined to provide multiple functions.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	For example, smart phone users no longer need a GPS, digital camera and PDA.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P8_S3	With the addition of a myriad of available apps, the potential uses seem endless.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P8_S4	As a result, advancements in mobile products are driving semiconductor advanced packaging and display manufacturers to implement next-generation technologies to meet the resulting requirements.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P8_S5	This technology shift has created multiple opportunities for Rudolph solutions.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P8_S6	Chip manufacturers deploy advanced macro defect inspection throughout the fab to monitor key process steps, gather process-enhancing information and ultimately, lower manufacturing costs.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P8_S7	Field-established tools such as the F30 and NSX inspection systems are found in wafer processing (front-end) and final manufacturing (back-end) facilities around the world.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P8_S8	These high-speed tools incorporate features such as waferless recipe creation, tool-to-tool correlation and multiple inspection resolutions.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P8_S9	In addition to wafer frontside inspection, Rudolph's innovative Explorer Inspection Cluster incorporates wafer edge and backside inspection in one integrated platform to enhance productivity and continuously improve fab yield.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P8_S10	New products added in 2012 include unpatterned wafer inspection and mask blank inspection.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	Using products such as Discover and Genesis yield management software, the vast amount of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed and classified to determine trends that ultimately affect yield.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	In order to deal with increased Input/Output, enhanced functionality, power efficiency and higher frequency, Integrated Device Manufacturers and OSATS are moving to advanced packaging technologies such as Through Silicon Via ( TSV ) and 3D.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	However, the associated substrates and processes are significantly different than those used in front-end wafer processing.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	the substrates resulting in warped substrates.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	Since most packaging is an additive process, thick films are used to enable the creation of features.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	In order for equipment to effectively function in this environment, it must overcome these challenges.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	The Rudolph JetStep System has been specifically designed to meet these challenges head on.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P12_S3	A large printable field combined with user-selectable wavelength options maximizes throughput while not limiting resolution when needed.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P12_S4	High fidelity optics are able to image the fine features required while at the same time achieving superior depth of field to minimize non-flatness effects.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P12_S5	On-the-fly auto focus and an innovative reticle management system improve yield and utilization.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P12_S6	These unique features result in a revolutionary lithography system specifically designed to meet advanced packaging challenges.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	In addition to advanced packaging, another critical aspect of any leading mobile device is the display.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	The display serves as the window to the user.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	Therefore, it must effectively present graphics such as detailed maps, high resolution photos and streaming video in order to meet user expectations.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P13_S3	To accomplish this, the display transistor backplane, which is what controls the pixels, must operate at a high frequency and have high pixel resolution.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P13_S4	As a result, the transistors must have high mobility and only use a small portion of the pixel aperture.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	The backplane is manufactured on a sheet of glass; like the packaging substrate, it is non-flat and tends to distort further during processing.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	Additionally, the displays are getting larger.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P14_S2	Manufacturers are looking to utilize larger sheets of glass, making throughput a challenge for the lithography equipment.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P14_S3	To overcome this, Rudolph s PanelPrinter 9200 uses high-fidelity optics and the largest printable stepper field available enabling more displays per shoot.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P14_S4	This feature, combined with on-the-fly auto-focus and magnification compensation, maximizes throughput and yield.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P14_S5	Finally, the innovative grid stage allows the system to be easily scaled to meet the customer desired substrate size.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P14_S6	The similarity of the systems for both of these applications allows Rudolph to utilize a simple supply chain improving reliability and margins.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P14_S7	More importantly, as a feature is designed for a specific system, it adds to an archive of technology that can be leveraged to continue to meet the customer demands as they arise.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	Rudolph s patented transparent film technology uses up to four lasers operating simultaneously at multiple angles and multiple wavelengths, providing powerful analysis and measurement capabilities.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	Unlike the white-light sources used in spectroscopic ellipsometers, laser light sources make our metrology tools inherently stable, increase measurement speed and accuracy, and reduce maintenance costs by minimizing the time required to re-qualify a light source when it is replaced.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	Rudolph s S3000 System employs a proprietary reflectometer technology that allows the characterization of films and film stacks that cannot be performed using conventional reflectometry or ellipsometry alone.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	For opaque film characterization, the Meta PULSE System gives customers the ability to simultaneously measure the thickness and other properties of up to six metal or other opaque film layers in a non-contact manner on product wafers.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P16_S2	PULSE Technology uses an ultra-fast laser to generate sound waves that pass down through a stack of opaque films such as those used in copper or aluminum interconnect processes, sending back to the surface an echo that indicates film thickness, density, and other process critical parameters.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P16_S3	We believe we are a leader in providing systems that can non-destructively measure opaque thin-film stacks with the speed and accuracy semiconductor device manufacturers demand in order to achieve high yields with the latest fabrication processes.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P16_S4	The technology is ideal for characterizing copper interconnect structures and the majority of all systems sold have been for copper applications.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	Rudolph has a comprehensive offering of process control software solutions for semiconductor, solar and LED manufacturing.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	We provide a wide range of advanced process control solutions, all designed to improve factory profitability, including run-to-run control, fault detection, classification and tool automation.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	Rudolph is a leading provider of Process Control Software in the semiconductor industry.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	Technology We believe that our expertise in engineering and our continued investment in research and development enable us to rapidly develop new technologies and products in response to emerging industry trends.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	The breadth of our technology enables us to offer a diverse combination of measurement technologies that provide process control for the majority of thin films used in semiconductor manufacturing.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P19_S2	Unique features have been designed into our lithography systems to meet our customers changing process requirements.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P19_S3	Our defect detection and classification technologies allow us to provide yield enhancement for critical front-end processes such as photolithography, diffusion, etch, CMP and outgoing quality control.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	Information learned through post-fab inspection is critical.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	inspection within the final manufacturing (back-end) process provides our customers with critical quality assurance and process information.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing or general handling, and can have a major impact on device and process quality.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Automating the defect detection and classification process is best done by a system that can mimic, or even extend, the response of the human eye, but at a much higher speed, with high resolution and more consistency.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	To do this, our systems capture full-color whole wafer images using simultaneous dark and bright field illumination.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P22_S2	The resulting bright and dark field images are compared to those from an ideal wafer having no defects.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P22_S3	When a difference is detected, its image is broken down into mathematical vectors that allow rapid and accurate comparison with a library of known classified defects stored in the tool's database.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P22_S4	Patented and proprietary enhancements of this approach enable very fast and highly repeatable image classification.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P22_S5	The system is pre-programmed with an extensive library of default local, global, and color defects and can also absorb a virtually unlimited amount of new defect classes.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P22_S6	This allows customers to define defects based on their existing defect classification system, provides more reliable automated rework decisions, and enables more accurate statistical process control data.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	All-surface refers to inspection of the wafer frontside, edge, and backside as well as post-fab die.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	The edge inspection process focuses on the area near the wafer edge, an area that poses difficulty for traditional wafer frontside inspection technology due to its varied topography and process variation.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	Edge bevel inspection looks for defects on the side edge of a wafer.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	The edge bead removal and edge exclusion metrology involve a topside surface measurement required exclusively in the photolithography process, primarily to determine if wafers have been properly aligned for the edge exclusion region.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	The primary reason for wafer backside inspection is to determine if contamination has been created that may spread throughout the fab.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	For instance, it is critical that the wafer backside be free of defects prior to the photolithography process to prevent focus and exposure problems on the wafer front-side.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P26_S2	In addition to the wafer processing floor, Rudolph's automated inspection systems are used in several post-fab processes such as bump inspection, wafer probe, wafer saw and quality control and in new process technologies such as TSV.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	Classifying defects off-line enables automated inspection systems to maintain their high throughput.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	Using defect image files captured by automated inspection systems, operators are able to view high-resolution defect images to determine defects that cause catastrophic failure of a device, or killer defects.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P27_S2	Classifying defects enables faster analysis by grouping defects found together as one larger defect, a scratch for example, and defects of similar types across a wafer lot to be grouped based on size, repeating defects and other user-defined specifications.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P27_S3	Automatically classifying defects provides far greater yield learning than human classification.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	Using wafer maps, charts and graphs, the vast amounts of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed to determine trends across bumps, die, wafers and lots.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	This analysis may determine where in the process an inconsistency is being introduced, allowing for enhancements to be made and yields improved.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	Defect data analysis is performed to identify, analyze and locate the source of defects and other manufacturing process excursions.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	Using either a single wafer map or a composite map created from multiple wafer maps, this analysis enables identification of defect patterns and distribution.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P29_S2	When combined with inspection data from strategically-placed inspection points, this analysis may pinpoint the source of the defects so corrective action can be taken.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P29_S3	The combination of Fast 3D-OCM (optical comparative metrology) Technology with improved testing accuracy and repeatability is designed to reduce total test time for even the most advanced large area probe cards.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P29_S4	3-D capabilities enable users to analyze probe marks and probe tips in a rapid and information-rich format.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	Advanced Packaging Lithography (Step and Repeat Technology).
1094392_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	Rudolph steppers use projection optics to expose circuit patterns from a mask or reticle onto a substrate to achieve images with the optimal fidelity required for advanced packaging technologies.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	These systems employ light from a mercury arc lamp that is transmitted through a mask or reticle containing display circuit patterns.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	Substrates are aligned on the system and the mask is imaged through a projection lens in photoresist material coated on the substrate.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	The substrate is then moved, or stepped, to a second position to expose an adjacent area.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P31_S3	Images can be stitched together precisely to form larger circuit patterns without any noticeable change in circuit performance.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P31_S4	The system repeats the step and exposure process until the entire substrate is patterned.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	Tetramethylammonium Hydroxide ( TMAH ) or sodium hydroxide ( NaOH ), to reveal the underlying material.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	The imaged photoresist serves as a barrier that allows for processing the underlying metal or insulating layers.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	The substrates then continue through the etching, stripping, and deposition processes until multi-layer circuits are completed.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	Optical acoustic metrology involves the use of ultra-fast laser induced sonar for metal and opaque thin film measurement.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	This technology sends ultrasonic waves into multi-layer opaque films and then analyzes the resulting echoes to simultaneously determine the thickness of each individual layer in complex multi-layer metal film stacks.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P33_S2	The echo's amplitude and phase can be used to detect film properties, missing layers, and interlayer problems.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P33_S3	Since different phenomena affect amplitude and phase uniquely, a variety of process critical interlayer problems can be detected in a single measurement.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	The use of optical acoustics to measure multi-layer metal and opaque films was pioneered by scientists at Brown University ( Brown ) in collaboration with engineers at Rudolph.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	The proprietary optical acoustic technology in our PULSE Technology systems measures the thickness of single or multi-layer opaque films ranging from less than 40 Angstroms to greater than five microns.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	It provides these measurements at a rate of up to 70 wafers per hour within one to two percent accuracy and typically less than one percent repeatability.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P34_S3	This range of thicknesses covers the majority of thick and thin metal films projected by the International Roadmap for Semiconductors to be used through the end of this decade.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	Our non-contact, non-destructive optical acoustic technology and small spot size enable our PULSE Technology systems to measure film properties directly on product wafers.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	Ellipsometry is a non-contact, non-destructive optical technique for transparent thin film measurement.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	We have been an industry leader in ellipsometry technology for the last three decades.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P36_S2	We hold patents on several ellipsometry technologies, including our proprietary technique that uses four lasers for multiple-angle of incidence, multiple wavelength ellipsometry.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P36_S3	Laser ellipsometry technology enables our transparent film systems to continue to provide the increasingly higher level of accuracy needed as thinner films and newer materials are introduced for future generations of semiconductor devices.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P36_S4	We extended this same optical technology to characterize the scatterometry signal from patterned surfaces, allowing measurement of critical dimensions.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P36_S5	For applications requiring broader spectral coverage, some of our ellipsometry tools are also equipped with a reflectometer.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	Reflectometry uses a white or ultraviolet light source to determine the properties of transparent thin films by analyzing the wavelength and intensity of light reflected from the surface of a wafer.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	This optical information is processed with software algorithms to determine film thickness and other material properties.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P37_S2	By combining data from both the laser ellipsometer and broad spectrum reflectometer, it is possible to characterize films and film stacks that cannot be adequately analyzed by either method individually.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	Advanced Process Control ( APC ) employs software to automatically detect or predict tool failure (fault detection) as well as calculate recipe settings for a process that will drive the process output to target despite variations in the incoming material and disturbances within the process equipment.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	Process control software enables the factory to increase capacity and yield and to decrease rework and scrap.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P38_S2	It enables reduced production costs by lowering consumables, process engineering time and manufacturing cycle time.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	Products Rudolph markets and sells products to major logic, memory, data storage, flat panel and application-specific integrated circuit ( ASIC ) device manufacturers.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	Our customers rely on us for versatile inspection, lithography, and metrology systems as well as process control software solutions.

1094392_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	We depend on a relatively small number of customers and end users for a large percentage of our revenues.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	In the years 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , sales to end user customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for 44.4% , 43.6% and 50.9% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P41_S2	In 2010 , sales to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Semiconductor Inc. accounted for 13.9% and 11.2% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P41_S3	In 2011 , sales to Infineon Technologies and Samsung Semiconductor Inc. accounted for 13.5% and 12.1% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P41_S4	In 2012 , sales to Samsung Semiconductor Inc. and Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. accounted for 10.4% and 10.1% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P41_S5	No other individual end user customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 .
1094392_13_ITEM1_P41_S6	We do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	Research and Development The markets for equipment and systems for manufacturing semiconductor devices and for performing macro-defect inspection and thin film transparent and opaque process control metrology are characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P42_S1	We believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products is critical to our success.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P42_S2	Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our technical, management and financial resources to research and development programs.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P42_S3	The core competencies of our research and development team include metrology systems for high volume manufacturing, ellipsometry, ultra-fast optics, picosecond acoustic and optical design, advanced metrology application development and algorithm development.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P42_S4	To leverage our internal research and development capabilities, we maintain close relationships with leading research institutions in the metrology field, including Brown University.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P42_S5	Our relationship with Brown University has resulted in the development of the optical acoustic technology underlying our Meta PULSE product line.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P42_S6	We have been granted exclusive licenses from Brown University Research Foundation, subject to rights retained by Brown and the United States government for their own non-commercial uses for several patents relating to this technology.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P42_S7	Our research and development expenditures in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 were $33.4 million , $36.3 million and $39.3 million , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P42_S8	We plan to continue our strong commitment to new product development in the future, and we expect that our level of research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollar terms in future periods.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	We maintain an extensive network of direct sales, customer service and application support offices in several locations throughout the world.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	We maintain sales, service or applications offices in locations including, but not limited to the United States, Scotland, Germany, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, China and Japan.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P43_S2	We provide our customers with comprehensive support before, during and after the delivery of our products.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P43_S3	For example, in order to facilitate the smooth integration of our tools into our customers operations, we often assign dedicated, site-specific field service and applications engineers to provide long-term support at selected customer sites.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P43_S4	We also provide comprehensive service and applications training for customers at our training facilities in Bloomington, Minnesota and Budd Lake, New Jersey and at customer locations.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P43_S5	In addition, we maintain a group of highly skilled applications scientists at strategically located facilities throughout the world and at selected customer locations.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	Manufacturing Our principal manufacturing activities include assembly, final test and calibration.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	These activities are conducted in our manufacturing facility in Minnesota.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P44_S2	Our core manufacturing competencies include electrical, optical and mechanical assembly and testing, as well as the management of new product transitions.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	used in our products are engineered and manufactured to our specifications.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	We expect to rely increasingly on subcontractors and turnkey suppliers to fabricate components, build assemblies and perform other non-core activities in a cost-effective manner.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P45_S2	We rely on a number of limited source suppliers for certain parts and subassemblies.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P45_S3	This reliance creates a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components, and reduced control over pricing and time of delivery of components.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P45_S4	An inability to obtain adequate supplies would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or might require us to redesign our systems to accommodate different components or subassemblies.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P45_S5	To date, we have not experienced any significant delivery delays.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P45_S6	However, if we were forced to seek alternative sources of supply, manufacture such components or subassemblies internally, or redesign our products, this could prevent us from shipping our products to our customers on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	We have a policy of seeking patents on inventions governing new products or technologies as part of our ongoing research, development, and manufacturing activities.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , we have been granted, or hold exclusive licenses to, 243 U.S. and foreign patents.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P46_S2	The patents we own, jointly own or exclusively license have expiration dates ranging from 2013 to 2031 .
1094392_13_ITEM1_P46_S3	We also have 101 pending regular and provisional applications in the U.S. and other countries.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P46_S4	Our patents and applications principally cover various aspects of macro-defect detection and classification, transparent thin film measurement and altered material characterization.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P46_S5	We have been granted exclusive licenses from Brown University Research Foundation, subject to rights retained by Brown and the United States government for their own non-commercial uses, for several patents relating to the optical acoustic technology underlying our Meta PULSE product family.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P46_S6	The terms of these exclusive licenses are equal to the lives of the patents.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P46_S7	We pay royalties to Brown based upon a percentage of our revenues from the sale of systems that incorporate technology covered by the Brown patents.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P46_S8	We also have the right to support patent activity with respect to new ultra-fast acoustic technology developed by Brown scientists, and to acquire exclusive licenses to this technology.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P46_S9	Brown may terminate the licenses if we fail to pay royalties to Brown or if we materially breach our license agreement with Brown.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P46_S10	Our pending patents may never be issued, and even if they are, these patents, our existing patents and the patents we license may not provide sufficiently broad protection to protect our proprietary rights, or they may prove to be unenforceable.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P46_S11	To protect our proprietary rights, we also rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions and licenses.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P46_S12	There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same degree as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial infringement problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in such countries, some of which are countries in which we have sold and continue to sell products.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P47_S1	There is a risk that our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P47_S2	For example, our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P47_S3	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	Competition The market for semiconductor capital equipment is highly competitive.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	We face substantial competition from established companies in each of the markets that we serve.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P48_S2	We principally compete with KLA-Tencor, Camtek and Ultratech.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P48_S3	We compete to a lesser extent with companies such as Nanometrics and Nikon.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P48_S4	Each of our products also competes with products that use different metrology techniques.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P48_S5	Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, broader product offerings and service capabilities and larger installed customer bases than we do.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P48_S6	Significant competitive factors in the market for inspection and metrology systems include system performance, ease of use, reliability, cost of ownership, technical support and customer relationships.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	To remain competitive, we believe we will need to maintain a high level of investment in research and development and process applications.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	No assurances can be given that we will continue to be competitive in the future.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	Backlog We schedule production of our systems based upon order backlog and informal customer forecasts.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	We include in backlog only those orders to which the customer has assigned a purchase order number and for which delivery is anticipated within 12 months.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P50_S2	Because shipment dates may be changed and customers may cancel or delay orders with little or no penalty, our backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P50_S3	At December 31, 2012 , we had a backlog of approximately $27.2 million compared with a backlog of approximately $53.2 million at December 31, 2011 .
1094392_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	Employees As of December 31, 2012 , we had 651 employees.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P51_S1	Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements, and we have never experienced a work stoppage.
1094392_13_ITEM1_P51_S2	We believe our employee relations are good.

1094392_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Risks Related to Rudolph Our operating results have varied, and will likely continue to vary significantly, from quarter to quarter in the future, causing volatility in our stock price Our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and will likely continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, causing volatility in our stock price.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Some of the factors that may influence our operating results and subject our stock to extreme price and volume fluctuations include:
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	the levels of our fixed expenses, including research and development costs associated with product development, relative to our revenue levels.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In light of these factors and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Moreover, many of our expenses are fixed in the short-term which, together with the need for continued investment in research and development, marketing and customer support, limits our ability to reduce expenses quickly.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	As a result, declines in net sales could harm our business and the price of our common stock could substantially decline.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our largest customers account for a significant portion of our revenues, and our revenues and cash flows could significantly decline if one or more of these customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems or they delayed or canceled a large order Sales to end user customers that individually represent at least five percent of our revenues typically account for, in the aggregate, a considerable amount of our revenues.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We operate in the highly concentrated, capital-intensive semiconductor device manufacturing industry.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Historically, a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers, and this trend is expected to continue.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	If any of our key customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems in the future, or if a large order were delayed or canceled, our revenues and cash flows could significantly decline.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We expect that we will continue to depend on a small number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenues.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	In addition, as large semiconductor device manufacturers seek to establish closer relationships with their suppliers, we expect that our customer base will become even more concentrated.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Our customers may be unable to pay us for our products and services Our customers include some companies that may from time to time encounter financial difficulties, especially in light of the current economic environment and the turmoil in the credit markets.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P2_S6	If a customer s financial difficulties become severe, the customer may be unwilling or unable to pay our invoices in the ordinary course of business, which could adversely affect collections of both our accounts receivable and unbilled services.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P2_S7	The bankruptcy of a customer with a substantial account receivable could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P2_S8	In addition, if a customer declares bankruptcy after paying us certain invoices, a court may determine that we are not properly entitled to that payment and may require repayment of some or all of the amount we received, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P2_S9	Variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our systems may cause fluctuations in our operating results, which could cause our stock price to decline Variations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our revenues and cash flows, and consequently, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, to fluctuate widely from period to period.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P2_S10	This variation could cause our stock price to decline.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P2_S11	Our customers generally take a long time to evaluate our inspection and/or film metrology systems and many people are involved in the evaluation process.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P2_S12	We expend significant resources educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our systems in the semiconductor fabrication process.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P2_S13	The length of time it takes for us to make a sale depends upon many factors including, but not limited to:
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	the quality and sophistication of the customer s current metrology and/or inspection equipment.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Because of the number of factors influencing the sales process, the period between our initial contact with a customer and the time when we recognize revenue from that customer and receive payment, if ever, varies widely in length.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our sales cycles, including the time it takes for us to build a product to customer specifications after receiving an order to the time we recognize revenue, typically range from six to 15 months.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Sometimes our sales cycles can be much longer, particularly with customers in Japan.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	During these cycles, we commit substantial resources to our sales efforts in advance of receiving any revenue, and we may never receive any revenue from a customer despite our sales efforts.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P4_S4	If we do make a sale, our customers often purchase only one of our systems, and then evaluate its performance for a lengthy period before purchasing any more of our systems.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P4_S5	The number of additional products a customer purchases, if any, depends on many factors, including the customer s capacity requirements.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P4_S6	The period between a customer s initial purchase and any subsequent purchases can vary from six months to a year or longer, and variations in the length of this period could cause further fluctuations in our operating results and possibly in our stock price.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Most of our revenues have been derived from customers outside of the United States subjecting us to operational, financial and political risks, such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs, political and economic instability, outbreaks of hostilities, and difficulties in managing foreign sales representatives and foreign branch operations Due to the significant level of our international sales, we are subject to a number of material risks, including: Compliance with foreign laws.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our business is subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally, including compliance with, inconsistencies among, and unexpected changes in, a wide variety of foreign laws and regulatory environments with which we are not familiar, including, among other issues, with respect to employees, protection of our intellectual property, and a wide variety of operational regulations and trade and export controls under domestic, foreign, and international law.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including tariffs and other market barriers.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The semiconductor device industry is a high-visibility industry in many of the European and Asian countries in which we sell our products.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Because the governments of these countries have provided extensive financial support to our semiconductor device manufacturing customers in these countries, we believe that our customers could be disproportionately affected by any trade embargoes, excise taxes or other restrictions imposed by their governments on trade with United States companies such as ourselves.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Any restrictions of these types could result in a reduction in our sales to customers in these countries.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We are subject to various global risks related to political and economic instabilities in countries in which we derive sales.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If terrorist activities, armed conflict, civil or military unrest or political instability occurs outside of the U.S., these events may result in reduced demand for our products.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	There is considerable political instability in Taiwan related to its disputes with China and in South Korea related to its disputes with North Korea.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In addition, several Asian countries, particularly Japan, have experienced significant economic instability.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	An outbreak of hostilities or other political upheaval in China, Taiwan or South Korea, or an economic downturn in Japan or other countries, would likely harm the operations of our customers in these countries.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The effect of these types of events on our revenues and cash flows could be material because we derive substantial revenues from sales to semiconductor device foundries in Taiwan such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd., from memory chip manufacturers in South Korea such as Samsung, and from semiconductor device manufacturers in Japan such as Toshiba.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign branch operations.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	During periods of tension between the governments of the United States and certain other countries, it is often difficult for United States companies such as ourselves to staff and manage operations in such countries.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Language and other cultural differences may also inhibit our sales and marketing efforts and create internal communication problems among our U.S. and foreign research and development teams, increasing the difficulty of managing multiple, remote locations performing various development, quality assurance, and yield ramp analysis projects.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Currency fluctuations as compared to the U.S. Dollar.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	A substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As a result, if the dollar rises in value in relation to foreign currencies, our systems will become more expensive to customers outside the United States and less competitive with systems produced by competitors outside the United States.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	These conditions could negatively impact our international sales.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	also expose us to collection risk in the event it becomes more expensive for our foreign customers to convert their local currencies into U.S. dollars.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Additionally, in the event a larger portion of our revenue becomes denominated in foreign currencies, we would be subject to a potentially significant exchange rate risk.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If we deliver systems with defects, our credibility will be harmed and the sales and market acceptance of our systems will decrease Our systems are complex and have occasionally contained errors, defects and bugs when introduced.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing or general handling, and can have a major impact on device and process quality.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	When this occurs, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our systems could be harmed.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Further, if our systems contain errors, defects or bugs, computer viruses or malicious code as a result of cyber attacks to our computer networks, we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate these problems.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Defects could also lead to product liability as a result of product liability lawsuits against us or against our customers.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We have agreed to indemnify our customers under certain circumstances against liability arising from defects in our systems.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our product liability policy currently provides $2.0 million of aggregate coverage, with an overall umbrella limit of $14.0 million .
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	In the event of a successful product liability claim, we could be obligated to pay damages significantly in excess of our product liability insurance limits.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If we are not successful in developing new and enhanced products for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry, we will lose market share to our competitors We operate in an industry that is highly competitive and subject to evolving industry standards, rapid technological changes, rapid changes in consumer demands and the rapid introduction of new, higher performance systems with shorter product life cycles.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	To be competitive in our demanding market, we must continually design, develop and introduce in a timely manner new inspection, lithography and film metrology systems that meet the performance and price demands of semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We must also continue to refine our current systems so that they remain competitive.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We expect to continue to make significant investments in our research and development activities.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We may experience difficulties or delays in our development efforts with respect to new systems, and we may not ultimately be successful in our product enhancement efforts to improve and advance products or in responding effectively to technological change, as not all research and development activities result in viable commercial products.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P14_S5	In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to develop new products for the most opportunistic new markets and applications.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Any significant delay in releasing new systems could cause our products to become obsolete, adversely affect our reputation, give a competitor a first-to-market advantage or cause a competitor to achieve greater market share.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P14_S7	In addition, new product offerings that are highly complex in terms of software or hardware may require application or service work such as bug fixing prior to acceptance, thereby delaying revenue recognition.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P14_S8	If new products developed by us do not gain general market acceptance, we will be unable to generate revenues and recover our research and development costs Inspection, lithography and metrology product development is inherently risky because it is difficult to foresee developments in semiconductor device manufacturing technology, coordinate technical personnel, and identify and eliminate system design flaws.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P14_S9	Further, our products are complex and often the applications to our customers businesses are unique.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P14_S10	Any new systems we introduce may not achieve or sustain a significant degree of market acceptance and sales.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P14_S11	We expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources developing new systems and refining our existing systems.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P14_S12	In light of the long product development cycles inherent in our industry, these expenditures will be made well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenue from the sale of those systems.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P14_S13	Our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market new systems are subject to a wide variety of challenges during the development cycle, including start-up bugs, design defects, and other matters that could delay introduction of these systems.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P14_S14	In addition, since our customers are not obligated by long-term contracts to purchase our systems, our anticipated product orders may not materialize, or orders that are placed may be canceled.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P14_S15	As a result, if we do not achieve market acceptance of new products, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows to recover our research and development costs and our market share, revenue, operating results or stock price would be negatively impacted.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Even if we are able to develop new products that gain market acceptance, sales of these new products could impair our ability to sell existing products Competition from our new systems could have a negative effect on sales of our existing systems and the prices that we could charge for these systems.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We may also divert sales and marketing resources from our current systems in order to successfully launch and promote our new or next generation systems.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	This diversion of resources could have a further negative effect on sales of our current systems and the value of inventory.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If our relationships with our large customers deteriorate, our product development activities could be adversely affected The success of our product development efforts depends on our ability to anticipate market trends and the price, performance and functionality requirements of semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In order to anticipate these trends and ensure that critical development projects proceed in a coordinated manner, we must continue to collaborate closely with our largest customers.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Our relationships with these and other customers provide us with access to valuable information regarding trends in the semiconductor device industry, which enables us to better plan our product development activities.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P15_S6	If our current relationships with our large customers are impaired, or if we are unable to develop similar collaborative relationships with important customers in the future, our product development activities could be adversely affected.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Our ability to reduce costs is limited by our ongoing need to invest in research and development and to provide customer support activities Our industry is characterized by the need for continual investment in research and development as well as customer service and support.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P15_S8	As a result, our operating results could be materially affected if operating costs associated with our research and development as well as customer support activities increase in the future or we are unable to reduce those activities.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P15_S9	We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property and, therefore, lose our competitive advantage Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology for our principal product families, and we rely, in part, on patent and trade secret law and confidentiality agreements to protect that technology.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P15_S10	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it will give our competitors a significant advantage.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P15_S11	We own or have licensed a number of patents relating to our transparent and opaque thin film metrology, lithography and macro-defect inspection systems, and have filed applications for additional patents.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P15_S12	Any of our pending patent applications may be rejected, and we may be unable to develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable in the future.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P15_S13	In addition, the patents that we do own or that have been issued or licensed to us may not provide us with competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P15_S14	Further, third parties may also design around these patents.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In addition to patent protection, we rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and technology.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and other third parties.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Even though these agreements are in place there can be no assurances that trade secrets and proprietary information will not be disclosed, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, or that we can fully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Violations by others of our confidentiality agreements and the loss of employees who have specialized knowledge and expertise could harm our competitive position and cause our sales and operating results to decline as a result of increased competition.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Costly and time-consuming litigation might be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection might adversely affect our ability to continue our research or bring products to market.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Protection of our intellectual property rights, or the efforts of third parties to enforce their own intellectual property rights against us, may result in costly and time-consuming litigation, substantial damages, lost product sales and/or the loss of important intellectual property rights We may be required to initiate litigation in order to enforce any patents issued to or licensed by us, or to determine the scope or validity of a third party s patent or other proprietary rights.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Any litigation, regardless of outcome, could be expensive and time consuming, and could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to re-engineer our products or obtain expensive licenses from third parties.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	In addition, our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P17_S4	From time to time, we may receive communications from third parties asserting that our products or systems infringe, or may infringe, the proprietary rights of these third parties.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P17_S5	These claims of infringement may lead to protracted and costly litigation, which could require us to pay substantial damages or have the sale of our products or systems stopped by an injunction.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Infringement claims could also cause product or system delays or require us to redesign our products or systems, and these delays could result in the loss of substantial revenues.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P17_S7	We may also be required to obtain a license from the third party or cease activities utilizing the third party s proprietary rights.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P17_S8	We may not be able to enter into such a license or such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P17_S9	Accordingly, the loss of important intellectual property rights could hinder our ability to sell our systems, or make the sale of these systems more expensive.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P17_S10	For additional information regarding recent patent litigation, see Item 3.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in certain foreign countries, where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the United States The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement abroad.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	For example, Taiwan is not a signatory of the Patent Cooperation Treaty, which is designed to specify rules and methods for defending intellectual property internationally.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The publication of a patent in Taiwan prior to the filing of a patent in Taiwan would invalidate the ability of a company to obtain a patent in Taiwan.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Similarly, in contrast to the United States where the contents of patents remain confidential during the patent application process, in Taiwan the contents of a patent are published upon filing which provides competitors an advance view of the contents of a patent application prior to the establishment of patent rights.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Consequently, there is a risk that we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights in certain foreign countries.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S5	If this occurs, it would be easier for our competitors to develop and sell competing products in these countries.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Some of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, and increased competition could impair sales of our products or cause us to reduce our prices The market for semiconductor capital equipment is highly competitive.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S7	We face substantial competition from established companies in each of the markets we serve.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S8	We principally compete with KLA-Tencor, Camtek and Ultratech.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S9	We compete to a lesser extent with companies such as Nanometrics and Nikon.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S10	Each of our products also competes with products that use different metrology or inspection techniques.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S11	Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, broader product offerings and service capabilities and larger installed customer bases than we do.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S12	As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or market developments by devoting greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products, which, in turn, could impair sales of our products.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S13	Further, there may be significant merger and acquisition activity among our competitors and potential competitors, which, in turn, may provide them with a competitive advantage over us by enabling them to rapidly expand their product offerings and service capabilities to meet a broader range of customer needs.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Many of our customers and potential customers in the semiconductor device manufacturing industry are large companies that require global support and service for their semiconductor capital equipment.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We believe that our global support and service infrastructure is sufficient to meet the needs of our customers and potential customers.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	competing for the business of global semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Many of our competitors are investing heavily in the development of new systems that will compete directly with our systems.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We have from time to time selectively reduced prices on our systems in order to protect our market share, and competitive pressures may necessitate further price reductions.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We expect our competitors in each product area to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices and performance characteristics.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P20_S4	These product introductions would likely require us to decrease the prices of our systems and increase the level of discounts that we grant our customers.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Price reductions or lost sales as a result of these competitive pressures would reduce our total revenues and could adversely impact our financial results.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We believe that once a semiconductor device manufacturer has selected one vendor s capital equipment for a production-line application, the manufacturer generally relies upon that capital equipment and, to the extent possible, subsequent generations of the same vendor s equipment, for the life of the application.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Once a vendor s equipment has been installed in a production line application, a semiconductor device manufacturer must often make substantial technical modifications and may experience production-line downtime in order to switch to another vendor s equipment.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Accordingly, unless our systems offer performance or cost advantages that outweigh a customer s expense of switching to our systems, it will be difficult for us to achieve significant sales to that customer once it has selected another vendor s capital equipment for an application.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management, engineering, sales and marketing, customer support, finance and manufacturing personnel.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P21_S4	The loss of any of these key personnel, each of whom would be extremely difficult to replace, could harm our business and operating results.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Although we have employment and noncompetition agreements with key members of our senior management team, including Messrs. McLaughlin and Roth, these individuals or other key employees may still leave us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P21_S6	We do not have key person life insurance on any of our executives.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P21_S7	In addition, to support our future growth, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Competition for such personnel in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified employees.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P21_S9	We obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a limited group of suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenues We obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a limited group of suppliers and do not have long-term contracts with many of our suppliers.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P21_S10	Our dependence on limited source suppliers of components and our lack of long-term contracts with many of our suppliers exposes us to several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components, price increases, late deliveries and poor component quality.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P21_S11	Disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our systems, damage our customer relationships and reduce our sales.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	From time to time in the past, we have experienced temporary difficulties in receiving shipments from our suppliers.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The lead-time required for shipments of some of our components can be as long as four months.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In addition, the lead time required to qualify new suppliers for lasers could be as long as a year, and the lead time required to qualify new suppliers of other components could be as long as nine months.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	If we are unable to accurately predict our component needs, or if our component supply is disrupted, we may miss market opportunities by not being able to meet the demand for our systems.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Further, a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components or subassemblies could seriously harm our results of operations and cash flows.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility could have a material adverse effect on our revenues Our manufacturing processes are highly complex and require sophisticated and costly equipment and a specially designed facility.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	As a result, any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, or destruction of or damage as a result of a fire or any other reason, could seriously harm our ability to satisfy our customer order deadlines.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If we cannot timely deliver our systems, our results from operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Our earnings could be negatively affected and our inventory levels could materially increase if we are unable to predict our inventory needs in an accurate and timely manner and adjust our orders for parts and subcomponents should our needs increase or decrease materially due to unexpected increases or decreases in demand for our products.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Any material increase in our inventories could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, while any material decrease in our ability to procure needed inventories could result in an inability to supply customer demand for our products, thus adversely affecting our revenues.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Our ability to fulfill our backlog may have an effect on our long term ability to procure contracts and fulfill current contracts Our ability to fulfill our backlog may be limited by our ability to devote sufficient financial and human capital resources and limited by available material supplies.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P24_S6	If we do not fulfill our backlog in a timely manner, we may experience delays in product delivery which would postpone receipt of revenue from those delayed deliveries.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P24_S7	Additionally, if we are consistently unable to fulfill our backlog, this may be a disincentive to customers to award large contracts to us in the future until they are comfortable that we can effectively manage our backlog.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P24_S8	We may choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves, and may be unable to complete these acquisitions or may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired business in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner Our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P24_S9	To this end, we have, from time to time, engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P24_S10	We may choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products, technologies and/or services instead of developing them ourselves.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P24_S11	We may, however, face competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established companies with greater financial resources, making it more difficult for us to complete acquisitions.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P24_S12	We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from one or more acquisitions that we consummate.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P24_S13	Integrating any business, product technology or service we acquire could be expensive and time-consuming and/or disrupt our ongoing business.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P24_S14	Further, there are numerous risks associated therewith, including but not limited to:
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	unexpected reduction of sales of existing products by new products.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	benefits from one or more acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations, including as a result of our incurrence of indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In order to finance any acquisitions, we might need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In that event, we could be forced to obtain financing on terms that are not favorable to us and, in the case of equity financing, that result in dilution to our stockholders.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In addition, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, amortization of intangible assets, write-down of other assets or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions and purchase accounting could harm our business and operating results.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	If we cannot effectively manage our growth, our business may suffer Over the long-term, we intend to continue to grow by increasing our sales efforts and completing strategic acquisitions.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P27_S4	To effectively manage our growth, we must, among other things:
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	administer appropriate financial and administrative control procedures.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our anticipated growth will likely place a significant strain on our management, financial, operational, technical, sales and administrative resources.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Any failure to effectively manage our growth may cause our business to suffer and our stock price to decline.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Changes in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect results As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Our future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the (1) applicable tax laws; (2) composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates; or (3) valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P29_S3	In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P29_S4	We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Turmoil in the credit markets and the financial services industry may negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity During recent years, global credit markets and the financial services industry have been experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by tightening of the credit markets, weakening of the global economy and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States and other governments.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Adverse economic conditions, such as sustained periods of economic uncertainty or a crisis in the financial markets may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition if our ability to obtain credit from trade creditors were to be impaired.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	In addition, a worsening economy or an economic crisis could also adversely impact our customers ability to finance the purchase of systems from us or our suppliers ability to provide us with product, either of which may negatively impact our business and results of operations.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations As a result of our sale of $60.0 million of 3.75% convertible senior notes on July 25, 2011 (the Notes ), we now have long-term debt that we had not had to maintain prior to such time.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our maintenance of indebtedness could have important consequences because:
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our ability to generate sufficient cash to pay our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash to pay our debt obligations, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of our debt obligations, seek to refinance all or a portion of our debt obligations or obtain additional financing.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Failure to make a payment on our debt obligations could also result in acceleration of all of our debt obligations, including the Notes, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P33_S5	We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or to repurchase the Notes Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture that governs the Notes), subject to certain conditions, holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P33_S6	In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, we will be required to make cash payments of up to $1,000 for each $1,000 in principal amount of Notes converted.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P33_S7	However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered for repurchase upon a fundamental change or to make cash payments in respect of Notes that are being converted.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P33_S8	In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P33_S9	Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P33_S10	A default under the indenture or a fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing any future indebtedness.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P33_S11	If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	New regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers On August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	These requirements will require companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, including our products.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P34_S3	In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P34_S5	In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our operating results are subject to significant variation due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor device industry.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor device manufacturers, which, in turn, depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In recent years, the industry has experienced significant downturns, generally in connection with declines in economic conditions.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	This cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and, thus, future expense levels.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P37_S2	When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P37_S3	During a down cycle, we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P37_S4	In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P37_S5	We can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P37_S6	If we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business could be seriously harmed.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P37_S7	Our future rate of growth is highly dependent on the development and growth of the market for microelectronic device inspection, lithography and metrology equipment We target our products to address the needs of microelectronic device manufacturers for defect inspection and metrology.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P37_S8	If for any reason the market for microelectronic device inspection or metrology equipment fails to grow in the long term, we may be unable to maintain current revenue levels in the short term and maintain our historical growth in the long term.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Growth in the inspection market is dependent to a large extent upon microelectronic manufacturers replacing manual inspection with automated inspection technology.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Growth in the metrology market is dependent to a large extent upon new chip designs and capacity expansion of microelectronic manufacturers.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P38_S2	There is no assurance that manufacturers will undertake these actions at the rate we expect.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Risks Related to our Stock Provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law, as well as our stockholder rights plan, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and/or delay, deter or prevent a change in control of our company Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as our stockholder rights plan, may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board of Directors.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P38_S4	These provisions also limit the circumstances in which a premium can be paid for the common stock, and in which a proxy contest for control of our board may be initiated.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	the authority of our board, without stockholder approval, to adopt a Stockholder Rights Plan.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Such a Shareholder Rights Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on June 27, 2005 .
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We are also entitled to avail ourselves of the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could inhibit changes in control of us.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our stock price is volatile The market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	From the beginning of fiscal year 2009 through the end of fiscal year 2012 , our stock price fluctuated between a high of $13.52 per share and a low of $1.95 per share.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Factors affecting our stock price may include:
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	the number of firms making a market in our common stock.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	In addition, the stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P41_S2	These fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high technology companies like ours.
1094392_13_ITEM1A_P41_S3	These market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1094392_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our executive office building is located at One Rudolph Road in Flanders, New Jersey.
1094392_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own and lease facilities for engineering, manufacturing, sales and service related purposes in the United States and seven other countries China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Scotland.
1094392_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	The following table indicates the location, the general purpose and the square footage of our principal facilities.
1094392_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	The expiration years of the leases covering the leased facilities are also indicated.
1094392_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	We also lease office space for other smaller sales and service offices in several locations throughout the world.
1094392_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our existing facilities and capital equipment are adequate to meet our current requirements, and that suitable additional or substitute space is available on commercially reasonable terms if needed.
1094392_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business.
1094392_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	As previously disclosed, in December 2007 , we completed the acquisition of specific assets and liabilities of the semiconductor division of Applied Precision LLC ( Applied ).
1094392_13_ITEM3_P1_S1	As a result of the acquisition, we assumed certain liabilities of Applied including a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court, District of Arizona, by Integrated Technology Corporation ( ITC ) which alleged Applied s PrecisionPoint , PrecisionWoRx and ProbeWoRx products infringed an ITC patent (Integrated Technology Corporation v. Rudolph Technologies, Inc., No. CV-06-2182-PHX-ROS).
1094392_13_ITEM3_P1_S2	Prior to trial, the District Court ruled that such products sold prior to August of 2007 infringed the ITC patent.
1094392_13_ITEM3_P1_S3	In December 2011 , a trial verdict was rendered in which the jury found that while our products manufactured after August of 2007 did not literally infringe ITC s patent, the products were found to infringe under a rule known as the doctrine of equivalents, a legal principle which expands the language of patent claims to encompass products or processes which may otherwise be found not to literally infringe the patent.
1094392_13_ITEM3_P1_S4	The jury awarded $15.5 million to ITC in damages for sales made during the years 2000-2011 , of which award approximately one-half related to sales made after August 2007 .
1094392_13_ITEM3_P1_S5	The jury found that for sales made after August of 2007 the infringement was willful.
1094392_13_ITEM3_P1_S6	On July 23, 2012 , the District Court, responding to post-trial motions filed by us and ITC related to the verdict and damages assessment, issued an Order which affirmed the jury s award, applied treble damages to the portion of the jury award related to sales of the products after 2007 and granted ITC s motion for attorney s fees and prejudgment interest on the verdict and attorney s fees.
1094392_13_ITEM3_P1_S7	The District Court also enjoined us from future infringement of the ITC patent and from selling or supplying the applicable products with the applicable features from or into the United States.
1094392_13_ITEM3_P1_S8	We appealed the injunction, the District Court Order and the damages assessment.
1094392_13_ITEM3_P1_S9	In October 2012 , the injunction was stayed by the Federal Court of Appeals.
1094392_13_ITEM3_P1_S10	We believe that we have meritorious defenses and shall continue to vigorously prosecute our appeal.
1094392_13_ITEM3_P1_S11	With that, it is reasonably possible that we could realize a loss in this matter related to products sold after August of 2007 such that in the event that we are ultimately found liable, damage estimates related to this case, which have not been accrued for as of December 31, 2012 , range from approximately $25 thousand to $31.6 million .
1094392_13_ITEM3_P1_S12	With regard to products sold before August of 2007 , it is probable that we could realize a loss in this matter for which we have estimated and recorded a liability of approximately $4.3 million in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1094392_13_ITEM3_P1_S13	While we continue to believe that our current PrecisionWoRx and ProbeWoRx systems do not infringe ITC s patent, we reached an agreement with ITC in October 2012 with regards to a redesign of the products under which ITC agreed that such redesign is permissible under the court s injunction.
1094392_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	In our patent infringement suit against Camtek, Ltd., of Migdal Hamek, Israel, concerning our proprietary continuous scan wafer inspection technology, the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals issued a ruling on August 22, 2011 .
1094392_13_ITEM3_P2_S1	In its opinion, the Appellate Court affirmed multiple rulings from trial at the District Court level including (i) finding our U.S.
1094392_13_ITEM3_P2_S2	Patent No. 6,826,298 valid, (ii) the part of the infringement ruling based on the finding that Camtek s Falcon product strobes based on velocity, and (iii) the dismissal of Camtek s claim against us for inequitable conduct against the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
1094392_13_ITEM3_P2_S3	The court did, however, revise one claim construction ruling made by the District Court in the original case.
1094392_13_ITEM3_P2_S4	As a result, the Appellate Court set aside the verdict delivered by the jury for damages and the District Court s decision to enter an injunction against Camtek s selling Falcon tools in the U.S. and remanded the case back to the trial court for a limited trial on this the single infringement issue.
1094392_13_ITEM3_P2_S5	No trial date has been set for this limited trial.
1094392_13_ITEM3_P3_S0	This lawsuit was initially brought in 2005 by August Technology prior to its merger with us.

1094392_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1094392_13_ITEM6_P1_S1	The balance sheet data as of December 31, 2011 and 2012 and the statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2011 and 2012 set forth below were derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1094392_13_ITEM6_P1_S2	The balance sheet data as of 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , and the statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009 were derived from our audited consolidated financial statements not included herein.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview We are a worldwide leader in the design, development, and manufacture of high-performance process control defect inspection, advanced packaging lithography, metrology, and process control software systems used by microelectronics device manufacturers.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	We provide process and yield management solutions used in both wafer processing and final manufacturing through a family of standalone systems for macro-defect inspection, lithography, probe card test and analysis, and transparent and opaque thin film measurements.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	All Rudolph systems feature sophisticated software and production-worthy automation.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P0_S3	Rudolph systems are backed by worldwide customer support.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	In June 2012, we announced that we had acquired specific assets and liabilities of NanoPhotonics GmbH, located in Mainz, Germany ( NanoPhotonics acquisition ).
1094392_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	The acquired business has been integrated into our inspection technology group.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	The impact of the acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	In December 2012, we announced that we had acquired Azores Corporation, located in Wilmington, Massachusetts ( Azores acquisition ).
1094392_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	The acquired business marks our entry into the advanced packaging and FPD lithography markets.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	The impact of the acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P2_S4	We have made a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date for the NanoPhotonics and Azores acquisitions.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P2_S5	We expect to finalize our analysis of the purchase price allocation within the first year of the acquisitions, and therefore adjustments to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets may occur.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Rudolph s business is affected by the annual spending patterns of our customers on semiconductor capital equipment.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	The amount that our customers devote to capital equipment spending depends on a number of factors, including general worldwide economic conditions as well as other economic drivers such as personal computer, tablet, cell phone, other personal electronic devices and automotive sales.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	Current forecasts by industry analysts for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry are similar year-over-year capital spending to down 10% for 2013.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our revenues and profitability, tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	We monitor capital equipment spending through announced capital spending plans by our customers and monthly-published industry data such as the book-to-bill ratio.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	The book-to-bill ratio is a 3-month running statistic that compares bookings or orders placed with capital equipment suppliers to billings or shipments.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P4_S3	A book-to-bill ratio above 1.0 shows that semiconductor device equipment manufacturers are ordering equipment at a pace that exceeds the equipment suppliers shipments for the period.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P4_S4	The three month rolling average North American semiconductor equipment book-to-bill ratio was 0.9 for the month of December 2012 , increasing from the September 2012 book-to-bill ratio of 0.8 .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Historically, a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers, and we expect this trend to continue.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , sales to customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for 44.4% , 43.6% , and 50.9% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	In 2010 , sales to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Semiconductor, Inc. accounted for 13.9% and 11.2% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P5_S3	In 2011 , sales to Infineon Technologies and Samsung Semiconductor Inc. accounted for 13.5% and 12.1% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P5_S4	In 2012 , sales to Samsung Semiconductor Inc. and Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. accounted for 10.4% and 10.1% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P5_S5	We do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products, and they could cease purchasing products from us at any time.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P5_S6	A delay in purchase or cancellation by any of our large customers could cause quarterly revenues to vary significantly.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P5_S7	In addition, during a given quarter, a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P5_S8	Our macro-defect inspection and probe card and test analysis systems range in average selling price from approximately $250,000 to $1.7 million per system; our transparent film measurement systems range in average selling price from approximately $800,000 to $1.2 million per system; our opaque film measurement systems range in average selling price from approximately $1.0 million to $1.8 million per system; and our lithography steppers range in average selling price from approximately $3.0 million to $4.0 million per system.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	A significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customers outside of the United States.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	We expect that revenues generated from customers outside of the United States will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	The following table lists, for the periods indicated, the revenue derived from customers outside of the United States (in percentages of total revenues):
1094392_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	The sales cycle for our systems typically ranges from six to 15 months, and can be longer when our customers are evaluating new technology.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	Due to the length of these cycles, we invest significantly in research and development and sales and marketing in advance of generating revenues related to these investments.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our statements of operations data as percentages of our revenues.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	Our results of operations are reported as one business segment.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Results of Operations 2010 , 2011 and 2012 Revenues.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our revenues are derived from the sale of our systems, services, spare parts and software licensing.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	Our revenues were $195.3 million , $187.2 million and $218.5 million for the years ended 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	This represents a decrease of 4.1% from 2010 to 2011 and a increase of 16.7% from 2011 to 2012 .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P9_S4	The decrease in revenue from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to customer deferring purchases during the second half of 2011 due to changes in demands for their products and uncertainty in the global economy.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P9_S5	The increase in revenue from, 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to increased capital spending by our back-end customers in the semiconductor industry.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	The following table lists, for the periods indicated, the different sources of our revenues in dollars (thousands) and as percentages of our total revenues:
1094392_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Total systems and software revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 due to a slow down in system sales in the second half of 2011 as our customers deferred purchases due to changes in demands for their products and uncertainty in the global economy.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	This contributed to decreases in the number of inspection and metrology systems sold year-over-year and reflects decreases in inspection systems revenue of $14.1 million and metrology systems revenue of $0.8 million .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	The year-over-year increase in data analysis and review software revenues of $3.9 million from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to increased sales across all data analysis and review software product families.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	The average selling price of similarly configured systems has been consistent and therefore did not have a material impact on our revenue for the same period.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P11_S4	Systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to 59% of total revenue for 2010 compared to 55% of total revenue for 2011 .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P11_S5	The year-over-year increase in parts and service revenues in absolute dollars from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to increased spending by our customers on repairs of existing systems.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P11_S6	Parts and services revenues are generated from part sales, maintenance service contracts, system upgrades, as well as time and material billable service calls.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P11_S7	Total systems and software revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 due to an increase in demand for our products in advanced packaging.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P11_S8	This contributed to an increase in the number of inspection systems sold year-over-year and reflects an increase in inspection systems revenue of $37.1 million .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P11_S9	The year-over-year decreases in metrology systems revenue of $0.6 million and data analysis and review software revenues of $3.5 million from 2011 to 2012 are primarily due to decreased sales across all metrology and data analysis and review software product families.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P11_S10	The average selling price of similarly configured systems has been consistent and therefore did not have a material impact on our revenue for the same period.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P11_S11	Systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to 55% of total revenue for 2011 compared to 67% of total revenue for 2012 .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P11_S12	The year-over-year decrease in parts and service revenues in absolute dollars from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to decreased spending by our customers on repairs of existing systems as they purchased new systems.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P11_S13	Parts and services revenues are generated from part sales, maintenance service contracts, system upgrades, as well as time and material billable service calls.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P11_S14	Deferred revenues of $11.2 million are recorded in Other current liabilities at December 31, 2012 and primarily consist of $9.0 million for deferred maintenance agreements and $2.2 million for systems awaiting acceptance and outstanding deliverables.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P11_S15	Our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including manufacturing efficiencies, excess and obsolete inventory write-offs, pricing by competitors or suppliers, new product introductions, production volume, customization and reconfiguration of systems, international and domestic sales mix, and parts and service margins.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P11_S16	Our gross profit was $103.9 million , $100.4 million and $115.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P11_S17	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to product mix, which included an increase in software sales.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P11_S18	The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to product mix, which included a decrease in software sales.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	We do not track gross margin by the sources of revenue.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	The macro-defect inspection, thin film transparent, opaque process control, and probe card test analysis market is characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	We believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements of existing products, including the transition to copper and low-k dielectrics, wafer level packaging, the continuous shrinkage in critical dimensions, and the evolution of ultra-thin gate process control, is critical to our success.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our technical, management and financial resources to research and development programs.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P13_S3	Research and development expenditures consist primarily of salaries and related expenses of employees engaged in research, design and development activities.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P13_S4	They also include consulting fees, the cost of related supplies and legal costs to defend our patents.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P13_S5	Our research and development expense was $33.4 million , $36.3 million and $39.3 million in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P13_S6	The year-over-year dollar increase from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to higher compensation, increased patent litigation costs, as well as, the inclusion of a full year of engineering costs associated with an acquisition completed in the third quarter of 2010.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P13_S7	The year-over-year dollar increase from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to higher compensation and project costs, as well as, additional research and development costs for acquired businesses in 2012.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P13_S8	We continue to maintain our commitment to investing in new product development and enhancement to existing products in order to position ourselves for future growth.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs for sales, marketing, and general administrative personnel, as well as commissions and other non-personnel related expenses.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	Our selling, general and administrative expense was $38.2 million , $40.8 million and $40.2 million in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	The year-over-year increase from 2010 to 2011 in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily due to incremental higher compensation and corporate legal expenses.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P14_S3	This year-over-year decrease from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to decreased corporate legal expenses, partially offset by increased compensation costs.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	Amortization of Identifiable Intangible Assets .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	Amortization of identifiable intangible assets was $1.7 million , $1.8 million and $1.9 million in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P15_S2	The increase in amortization expense from 2010 to 2011 was due to a full year of amortization from assets derived from an acquisition completed in the third quarter of 2010 .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P15_S3	The increase in amortization expense from 2011 to 2012 was due to amortization from intangible assets from the NanoPhotonic acquisition in the second quarter of 2012 .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P15_S4	In 2010 , net interest income was $0.2 million .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P15_S5	In 2011 and 2012 , net interest expense was $1.9 million and $4.4 million , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P15_S6	The year-over-year increase in net interest expense for 2011 was primarily due to interest expense related to the convertible senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2011 .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P15_S7	The year-over-year increase in net interest expense for 2012 was primarily due to a full year of interest expense related to the convertible senior notes.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P15_S8	In 2010 and 2012 , net other expense was $0.3 million and $0.5 million , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P15_S9	In 2011 net other income was $0.8 million .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P15_S10	The year-over-year dollar changes in net other income (expense) were primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P15_S11	Income tax expense was $3.5 million in 2010 .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P15_S12	In 2011 and 2012 , we recorded income tax benefit of $4.8 million and $14.5 million , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P15_S13	Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $3.5 million or 11.5% of income before provision for income taxes.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P15_S14	This differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 35%, primarily as a result of projected tax payments in U.S. and foreign locations, offset by valuation allowances.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P15_S15	Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $4.8 million or (23.7)% of income before provision for income taxes.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P15_S16	The income tax benefit differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 35%, primarily as a result of reversal of valuation allowances, partially offset by projected tax payments in U.S. and foreign locations.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $14.5 million or (49.2)% of income before provision for income taxes.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	The income tax benefit differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 35%, primarily as a result of reversal of valuation allowances, partially offset by projected tax expense in U.S. and foreign locations.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	We evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets from future taxable income and establish valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	We consider available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	At December 31, 2011 and 2012 , we had valuation allowances of $24.7 million and $1.4 million on certain of our deferred tax assets to reflect the deferred tax asset at the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	The decrease in valuation allowance of $23.3 million is primarily due to a release of the tax valuation allowance.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P17_S4	We evaluated the realizability of the deferred tax asset based on positive earnings from 2010 through 2012 as well as the projected earnings in future years and believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized in the future years.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P17_S5	We will continue to monitor the realizability of the deferred tax asset and evaluate the valuation allowance.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was passed by Congress and signed into law in January.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	The provisions under this law were made retroactive to January 1, 2012.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	However, as a result of the law being signed in January 2013, the financial impact of any retroactive provision will be recorded as a discrete event in the first quarter of 2013.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P18_S3	We estimate that this discrete event will reduce tax expense in the first quarter of 2013 by approximately $0.8 million for research and development tax credits for 2012.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	As discussed in Part I, Item 3 ( Legal Proceedings ), we are subject to legal proceedings and claims, which includes, among other things, our on-going litigation with ITC in which we are in the process of appealing an order of the U.S. District Court in a patent infringement action related to the predictive scrub feature of our PrecisionPoint , PrecisionWoRx and ProbeWoRx products in which we were the defendants.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	See Part 1, Item 3 for a discussion of this action and the District Court's adverse order affirming the jury award and ordering other relief in this matter.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	We have appealed the order and damages assessment.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	In the event that the ultimate decision in the ITC Litigation results in a judgment of damages against us at the high end of the identified ranges, such result will have a material impact on the our results of operations and may also have a material impact on our liquidity and financial condition.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2011 , our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $167.6 million , while working capital amounted to $234.2 million .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	At December 31, 2012 , we had $169.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $257.0 million in working capital.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Typically during periods of revenue growth, changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a use of cash as we incur costs and expend cash in advance of receiving cash from our customers.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	Similarly, during periods of declining revenue, changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a source of cash as inventory purchases decline and revenue from prior periods is collected.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	Net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2011 and 2012 totaled $16.3 million , $45.4 million and $22.1 million , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P22_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2010 , cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, of $37.1 million , an increase in accrued liabilities of $2.7 million , a decrease in income tax receivable of $2.3 million , an increase in accounts payable of $2.2 million , an increase in deferred revenue of $0.9 million , and increase in other current liabilities of $0.8 million , partially offset by an increase of accounts receivable of $23.4 million and an increase of inventories of $5.6 million .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P22_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2011 , cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, of $28.9 million , a decrease of accounts receivable of $18.0 million , an increase in other current liabilities of $5.7 million , an increase in non-current liabilities of $1.5 million , and an increase in accrued liabilities of $1.1 million , partially offset by an increase in prepaid and other assets of $4.4 million , a decrease in accounts payable of $3.4 million , a decrease in deferred revenue of $1.3 million , and a decrease in income tax receivable of $0.5 million .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	increase in accrued liabilities of $1.7 million , and an increase in non-current liabilities of $0.3 million , partially offset by an increase of accounts receivable of $14.7 million , an increase in inventory of $6.7 million , a decrease in accounts payable of $2.7 million , an increase in prepaid and other assets of $1.4 million , and a decrease in other current liabilities of $1.0 million .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2011 and 2012 totaled $2.8 million , $71.2 million and $14.9 million , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2010 , net cash used by investing activities included purchases of marketable securities of $7.8 million , capital expenditures of $4.4 million and acquisition costs for business combinations of $0.8 million , partially offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $10.3 million .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2011 , net cash used by investing activities included purchases of marketable securities of $81.0 million and capital expenditures of $1.6 million , partially offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $11.4 million .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P23_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2012 , net cash used by investing activities included purchases of marketable securities of $96.3 million , acquisition costs for business combinations of $18.6 million , and capital expenditures of $2.4 million , partially offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $102.4 million .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P23_S5	Capital expenditures over the next twelve months are expected to be approximately $8.0 million to $11.0 million .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P23_S6	Net cash provided by financing activities was $0.5 million , $51.0 million and $0.5 million in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P23_S7	In the 2010 period, net cash provided by financing activities comprised proceeds received from sales of shares through share-based compensation plans of $0.3 million and tax benefit from share-based compensation plans of $0.2 million .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P23_S8	In the 2011 period, net cash provided by financing activities comprised net proceeds from the issuance of 3.75% convertible senior notes of $57.7 million , proceeds from the sale of a warrant of $7.0 million , tax benefit from employee stock plans of $0.5 million and proceeds received for sales of shares through share-based compensation plans of $0.3 million , partially offset by the purchase of the convertible note hedge of $14.5 million .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P23_S9	In the 2012 period, net cash provided by financing activities comprised proceeds received from sales of shares through share-based compensation plans of $0.3 million and tax benefit from share-based compensation plans of $0.2 million .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	From time to time we evaluate whether to acquire new or complementary businesses, products and/or technologies.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	We may fund all or a portion of the purchase price of these acquisitions in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	In July 2008 , our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to 3 million shares of Company common stock with no established end date.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	As of the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not purchased any shares under this program.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	On July 25, 2011 , we issued $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% convertible senior notes, which mature on July 15, 2016 and pay interest semiannually commencing on January 15, 2012 .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P25_S3	In connection with the issuance, we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P25_S4	The convertible note hedge transaction is intended to reduce potential dilution in our common stock upon conversion of the notes.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P25_S5	However, the warrant transaction will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrant.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P25_S6	Net proceeds realized from the sale of the convertible senior notes, the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions were $50.2 million .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P25_S7	We continue to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include financing potential acquisitions and strategic transactions, growth initiatives and working capital.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P25_S8	For additional information, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and amount of our revenues and our investment decisions, which will affect our ability to generate additional cash.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P25_S9	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for the next twelve months.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P25_S10	Thereafter, if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements, we may seek additional funding through bank borrowings, sales of securities or other means.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P25_S11	There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us or at all.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2012 , and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	This table excludes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits that totaled approximately $9.6 million at December 31, 2012 .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	We are currently unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount or periods when cash settlement of this liability may occur.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	The Company does not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity and capital resources.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Critical Accounting Policies Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	We review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P28_S3	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, business acquisitions, intangible assets, share-based payments, income taxes and warranty obligations.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P28_S4	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P28_S5	Results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P28_S6	These estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis, and by the Audit Committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P28_S7	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Revenue is recognized provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	Revenue recognition generally results at the following points: (1) for all transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment for all products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment; the portion of revenue associated with certain installation-related tasks is deferred, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation-related tasks; (2) for products that have not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized at customer technical acceptance; (3) for transactions which have occurred prior to January 1, 2011, revenue for arrangements with multiple elements, such as sales of products that include software and services, was allocated to each element using the residual method based on the fair value of the undelivered items as determined using the prior guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	Under the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements; (4) for transactions occurring on or after January 1, 2011 containing multiple elements, the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred using the relative selling price method utilizing vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) or estimated sales prices ( ESP ) until delivery of the deferred elements.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P29_S3	Third-party evidence is not typically used to determine selling prices as to limited availability of reliable competitor products selling prices.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	The ESP is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, gross margin objectives, internal costs and competitor pricing strategies.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Revenues from parts sales are recognized at the time of shipment.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	Revenue from training and service contracts is recognized ratably over the training period and contract period.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	A provision for the estimated cost of fulfilling warranty obligations is recorded at the time the related revenue is recognized.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P31_S3	Revenue from software license fees is recognized upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and VSOE exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P31_S4	License support and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	We specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if our assumptions are otherwise incorrect, additional allowances may be required.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P32_S3	We maintain reserves for our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product life-cycles, product demand and market conditions.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P32_S4	If actual product life-cycles, product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those originally projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	We account for acquired or merged businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition or merger at their respective fair values.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	Accordingly, for significant acquisitions, we typically obtain assistance from independent valuation specialists.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	There are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	For intangible assets, we typically utilize the income method.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the projected future cash flows (including timing) and the discount rate reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flows.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	For example, different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	All of these judgments and estimates can significantly impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P37_S3	Our formal annual impairment testing date for goodwill is October 31 st or prior to the next annual testing date if an event occurs or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	Under the amendments of ASC 350-10, ASU No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, beginning in the first quarter of 2012, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	If, we elect this option and after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	We have not elected this option to date.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process which requires us to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	The first step consists of estimating the fair value of our aggregated reporting unit using the market value of our common stock at October 31 st , multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares (market capitalization) and an implied control premium as if it were to be acquired by a single stockholder.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	We obtain information on completed sales of similar companies in a comparable industry to estimate an implied control premium for us.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	We compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value which includes goodwill.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	If the results of the initial market capitalization test produce results which are below the reporting unit carrying value, we will also consider if the market capitalization is temporarily low and, if so, we may also perform a discounted cash flow test.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the second step is completed to compute the impairment amount by determining the implied fair value of goodwill.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	This determination requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	goodwill which is compared to the corresponding carrying value to compute the goodwill impairment amount.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Long-Lived Assets and Acquired Intangible Assets.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	We periodically review long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and the impairment of such long-lived assets, if any, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	No such indicators were noted in 2012 .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	The fair value of our stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	The Black-Scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility, expected terms, risk-free rates and dividend yield.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	We use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	The expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options, and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	We have never paid cash dividends, and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends, and thus have assumed a 0% dividend yield.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	If our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share-based compensation cost, or if different assumptions had been used, we may have recorded too much or too little share-based compensation cost.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our share grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P48_S3	If the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	While we engage in product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P50_S3	Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	The need for a valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred taxes will be recoverable.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, we may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	At December 31, 2011 and 2012 , we had valuation allowances of $24.7 million and $1.4 million on certain of our deferred tax assets to reflect the deferred tax asset at the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P51_S3	The decrease in valuation allowance of $23.3 million is primarily due to a release of the tax valuation allowance.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P51_S4	We evaluated the realizability of the deferred tax asset based on positive earnings from 2010 and 2012 as well as the projected earnings in future years and believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized in the future years.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P51_S5	We will continue to monitor the realizability of the deferred tax asset and evaluate the valuation allowance.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	The first step requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that the tax position has met the threshold for recognition; therefore, we must evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	The second step requires us to measure the tax benefit of the tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized when effectively settled.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P52_S3	This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P52_S4	We reevaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues, and new audit activity.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P52_S5	Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, it could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	The ASU requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P54_S3	We do not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	In September 2011 , the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	The ASU is to simplify how entities, both public and non public, test goodwill for impairment.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	The amendments in the ASU permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two -step goodwill impairment test described in Topic 350.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	This ASU is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	In June 2011 , the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	The ASU is to improve the comparability, consistency, and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income and to facilitate convergence of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
1094392_13_ITEM7_P58_S2	The FASB decided to eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity, among other amendments in this ASU.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P58_S3	The ASU is to defer only those changes in ASU No. 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P58_S4	The amendments are being made to allow the FASB time to redeliberate whether to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P58_S5	These ASU s are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011 .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P58_S6	Other than a change in presentation, the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, as it is disclosure-only in nature.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	In May 2011 , the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	The ASU will improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
1094392_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	This ASU is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 .
1094392_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate and Credit Market Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates and market liquidity including our investments in certain available-for-sale securities and our convertible senior notes.
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our available-for-sale securities consist of fixed and variable rate income investments (Municipal notes, bonds and an auction rate security).
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates, market liquidity and credit ratings of issuers from our available-for-sale securities.
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	It is possible that we are at risk if interest rates, market liquidity or credit ratings of issuers change in an unfavorable direction.
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The magnitude of any gain or loss will be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our financial investments held as of December 31, 2012 , an immediate adverse change of 10% in interest rates (e.g. 3.00% to 3.30%) would result in an immaterial decrease in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities.
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P0_S6	The interest rate on our convertible senior notes is fixed.
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Therefore, any change in interest rates will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Foreign Currency Risk We have branch operations in Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea and wholly-owned subsidiaries in Europe, Japan and China.
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our international subsidiaries and branches operate primarily using local functional currencies.
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	These foreign branches and subsidiaries are limited in their operations and level of investment so that the risk of currency fluctuations is not material.
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P1_S3	A hypothetical 10% appreciation or depreciation in the U.S. dollar relative to the reporting currencies of our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 would have affected the foreign-currency-denominated non-operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries by approximately $0.9 million .
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	A substantial portion of our international systems sales are denominated in U.S. dollars with the exception of Japan and, as a result, we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these sales.
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Substantially all our sales in Japan are denominated in Japanese yen.
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	From time to time, we may enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within 12 months.
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The change in fair value of the forward contracts is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations each reporting period.
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P3_S2	As of December 31, 2011 and 2012 , we had twenty-six and eight forward contracts outstanding, respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P3_S3	The total notional contract value of these outstanding forward contracts at December 31, 2011 and 2012 was $2.7 million and $3.5 million , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1094392_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	The consolidated financial statements required by this item are set forth on the pages indicated at Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1094392_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in SEC rules and forms.
1094392_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, we have recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1094392_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management is required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures.
1094392_13_ITEM9A_P1_S2	We performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, to assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2012 .
1094392_13_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Based on that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2012 at the reasonable assurance level.
1094392_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
1094392_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1094392_13_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
1094392_13_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012 .
1094392_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1094392_13_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1094392_13_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 have been audited by Ernst Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company s quarter ended December 31, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

1094392_13_ITEM15_P24_S0	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: A. Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P24_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P24_S2	Revenue is recognized provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P24_S3	Revenue recognition generally results at the following points: (1) for all transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment for all products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment; the portion of revenue associated with certain installation-related tasks is deferred, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation-related tasks; (2) for products that have not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized at customer technical acceptance; (3) for transactions which have occurred prior to January 1, 2011, revenue for arrangements with multiple elements, such as sales of products that include software and services, was allocated to each element using the residual method based on the fair value of the undelivered items as determined using the prior guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P24_S4	Under the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements; (4) for transactions occurring on or after January 1, 2011 containing multiple elements, the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred using the relative selling price method utilizing vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) or estimated sales prices ( ESP ) until delivery of the deferred elements.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P24_S5	Third-party evidence is not typically used to determine selling prices as to limited availability of reliable competitor products selling prices.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P25_S0	The ESP is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, gross margin objectives, internal costs and competitor pricing strategies.

1094392_13_ITEM15_P26_S3	Revenue from software license fees is recognized upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and VSOE exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P26_S4	License support and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P27_S0	C. Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P28_S0	deferred tax assets, liabilities for product warranty, contingencies, including litigation reserves and share-based payments, including forfeitures and liabilities for tax uncertainties.

1094392_13_ITEM15_P31_S0	The Company reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P31_S1	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, credit quality and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P31_S2	When a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities are charged against earnings.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P32_S0	The specific identification method is used to determine the gains and losses on marketable securities.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P32_S1	For additional information on the Company s marketable securities, see Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P33_S0	F. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P33_S1	In the cases where the Company is aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligation, the Company records a specific allowance against amounts due, and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount management reasonably believes will be collected.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P33_S2	For all other customers, the Company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are outstanding, industry and geographic concentrations, the current business environment and historical experience.

1094392_13_ITEM15_P36_S0	of an asset may not be recoverable.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P37_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P37_S1	If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is generally based on discounted cash flows.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P38_S0	J. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Intangible assets with definitive useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P38_S1	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually and when there are indications of impairment.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P39_S0	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Company estimates the fair value of its aggregated reporting unit using the market value of its common stock at October 31 multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares (market capitalization) and an implied control premium as if it were to be acquired by a single stockholder.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P39_S2	The Company obtains information on completed sales of similar companies in the related industry to estimate the implied control premium for the Company.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	Under the amendments of ASC 350-10, ASU No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, beginning in the first quarter of 2012, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P40_S1	If, the Company elects this option and after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P40_S2	The Company has not elected this option to date.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	If the results of the initial market capitalization test produce results which are below the reporting unit carrying value, the Company may also perform a discounted cash flow test.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P42_S0	The Company tested for goodwill impairment on October 31, 2012 .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P42_S1	For additional information on the Company s goodwill and purchased intangible assets, see Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	K. Concentration of Credit Risk: Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.

1094392_13_ITEM15_P44_S0	L. Warranties: The Company generally provides a warranty on its products for a period of twelve to fifteen months against defects in material and workmanship.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P44_S1	The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P45_S0	M. Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach for deferred taxes which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company s consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P46_S0	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce a deferred tax asset to that portion which more likely than not will be realized.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P47_S0	The Company does not provide for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign operations as it is the Company s intention to permanently re-invest undistributed earnings.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P47_S1	The impact of an uncertain income tax position is recognized as the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority and includes consideration of interest and penalties.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P48_S0	uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P48_S1	The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified as non-current unless the liability is expected to be settled in cash within 12 months of the reporting date.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P48_S2	For additional information on the Company s income taxes, see Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P49_S0	N. Translation of Foreign Currencies: The Company has branch operations in Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea and wholly-owned subsidiaries in Europe, Japan and China.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P49_S1	Its international subsidiaries and branches operate primarily using local functional currencies.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P49_S2	These foreign branches and subsidiaries are limited in their operations and level of investment so that the risk of currency fluctuations is not material.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P49_S3	A substantial portion of the Company s international systems sales are denominated in U.S. dollars with the exception of Japan and, as a result, it has relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these sales.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P49_S4	Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and income and expense accounts and cash flow items are translated at average monthly exchange rates during the period.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P49_S5	Net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements and the effect of exchange rates on intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature are recorded directly as a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption, Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P49_S6	Any foreign currency gains or losses related to transactions are included in operating results.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P49_S7	The Company had accumulated exchange losses resulting from the translation of foreign operation financial statements of $1,379 and $985 as of December 31, 2011 and 2012 , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P50_S1	The Black-Scholes valuation calculation requires the Company to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility, expected terms, risk-free interest rates and dividend yield.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company s stock.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P51_S1	The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P51_S2	The expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options, and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P51_S3	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P51_S4	The Company has never paid cash dividends, and does not currently intend to pay cash dividends, and thus has assumed a 0% dividend yield.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P51_S5	Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires significant judgment.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P52_S1	The Company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P52_S2	Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from the Company s current estimates.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	Compensation expense for all share-based payments includes an estimate for forfeitures and is recognized over the expected term of the share-based awards using the straight-line method.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P53_S1	For additional information on the Company s share-based compensation plans, see Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P54_S0	P. Research and Development and Software Development Costs: Expenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	Certain software product development costs incurred after technological feasibility has been established are capitalized and amortized, commencing upon the general release of the software product to the Company s customers, over the economic life of the software product.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P55_S1	Annual amortization of capitalized costs is computed using the greater of: (i) the ratio of current gross revenues for the software product over the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for the software product or (ii) the straight-line basis, typically over seven years.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P55_S2	Software product development costs incurred prior to the product reaching technological feasibility are expensed as incurred and included in research and development costs.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P56_S0	2011 and 2012 , capitalized software development costs were $562 and $201 , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P56_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , software development cost amortization totaled $354 , $356 and $361 , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P57_S0	Q. Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P57_S1	The carrying amount of our convertible senior notes was $46,524 and $49,010 as of December 31, 2011 and 2012 , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P57_S2	The fair value of our convertible senior notes was 46,524 and $51,018 as of December 31, 2011 and 2012 , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P57_S3	The Company s convertible senior notes are not publicly traded.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P58_S0	The estimated fair value of these obligations is based, primarily, on a market approach, comparing the Company s interest rates to those rates the Company believes it would reasonably receive upon re-entry into the market.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P58_S1	Judgment is required to estimate the fair value, using available market information and appropriate valuation methods.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P58_S2	For additional information on the Company s fair value of financial instruments, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P59_S0	R. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities: The Company, when it considers it to be appropriate, enters into forward contracts to hedge the economic exposures arising from foreign currency denominated transactions.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P59_S1	At December 31, 2011 and 2012 , these contracts included the future sale of Japanese Yen to purchase U.S. dollars.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P59_S2	The foreign currency forward contracts were entered into by the Company s Japanese subsidiary to hedge a portion of certain intercompany obligations.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P59_S3	The forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and therefore, the change in fair value is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P60_S0	The dollar equivalent of the U.S. dollar forward contracts and related fair values as of December 31, 2011 and 2012 were as follows:
1094392_13_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Company recognized a loss of $93 and $256 with respect to forward contracts that matured during 2010 and 2011 , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P61_S1	In 2012 , the Company recognized a gain of $112 with respect to forward contracts that matured.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P61_S2	The aggregate notional amount of matured contracts was $1,200 , $2,950 and $3,340 , for 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P61_S3	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2012 financial statement presentation.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	T. Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P62_S1	The ASU requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P62_S2	This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P62_S3	The Company does not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P63_S0	In September 2011 , the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P63_S1	The ASU is to simplify how entities, both public and non public, test goodwill for impairment.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P63_S2	The amendments in the ASU permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two -step goodwill impairment test described in Topic 350.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P64_S0	The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P64_S1	This ASU is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P64_S2	The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	In June 2011 , the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P65_S1	The ASU is to improve the comparability, consistency, and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income and to facilitate convergence of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
1094392_13_ITEM15_P65_S2	The FASB decided to eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity, among other amendments in this ASU.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P65_S3	The ASU is to defer only those changes in ASU No. 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P65_S4	The amendments are being made to allow the FASB time to redeliberate whether to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P65_S5	These ASU's are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011 .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P65_S6	Other than a change in presentation, the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, as it is disclosure-only in nature.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	In May 2011 , the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P66_S1	The ASU will improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P66_S2	This ASU is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P66_S3	The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	Business Combinations: NanoPhotonics In June 2012, the Company announced that it had acquired specific assets and liabilities of NanoPhotonics GmbH, located in Mainz, Germany ( NanoPhotonics acquisition ).
1094392_13_ITEM15_P67_S1	The acquired business has been integrated into the Company s inspection technology group.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	The impact of the acquisition was not material to the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P69_S0	In December 2012, the Company announced that it had acquired Azores Corporation, located in Wilmington, Massachusetts ( Azores acquisition ).
1094392_13_ITEM15_P69_S1	The acquired business marks the Company's entry into the advanced packaging and FPD lithography markets.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P70_S0	The impact of the acquisition was not material to the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P70_S1	The Company has made a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date for the NanoPhotonics and Azores acquisitions.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P70_S2	The Company expects to finalize its analysis of the purchase price allocation within the first year of the acquisitions, and therefore adjustments to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets may occur.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P71_S0	Fair Value Measurements: The Company applies a three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurements.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P71_S1	This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P72_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P72_S1	Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P72_S2	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management s assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P73_S0	A financial asset s or liability s fair value measurement classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P73_S1	The following tables provide the assets carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 :
1094392_13_ITEM15_P74_S0	The Company s investments classified as Level 1 are based on quoted prices that are available in active markets.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	The foreign currency forward contracts are primarily measured based on the foreign currency spot and forward rates quoted by the banks or foreign currency dealers.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P76_S0	The Company's investments classified as Level 2 are valued using observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P76_S1	Investment prices are obtained from third party pricing providers, which models prices utilizing the above observable inputs, for each asset class.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P77_S0	Level 3 investments consist of an auction rate security for which the Company uses a discounted cash flow model to value this investment.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P77_S1	The Level 3 assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model included estimates of interest rates of 2.5% , timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the auction rate security, based on data available as of December 31, 2012 .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P77_S2	Changes in the unobservable input values would be unlikely to cause material changes in the fair value of the auction rate security.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P78_S0	This table presents a reconciliation for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the year ended December 31, 2012 :
1094392_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	See Note 5 for additional discussion regarding the fair value of the Company s marketable securities.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P80_S1	The estimated fair value of these obligations is based, primarily, on a market approach, comparing the Company s interest rates to those rates the Company believes it would reasonably receive upon re-entry into the market.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P80_S2	Judgment is required to estimate the fair value, using available market information and appropriate valuation methods.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company s convertible senior notes are not publicly traded.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P81_S1	The carrying amount of the Company s convertible senior notes was $46,524 and $49,010 as of December 31, 2011 and 2012 , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P81_S2	The estimated fair value of the Company s convertible senior notes was $46,524 and $51,018 as of December 31, 2011 and 2012 , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Level 3 assumptions, based on data available as of December 31, 2012 , used in preparing the discounted cash flow model included estimates of interest rates 9.4% , timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the convertible senior notes.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P82_S1	The fair value of the contingent interest associated with the convertible notes is $0 as of December 31, 2012 and is valued quarterly using the present value of expected cash flow model incorporating the probabilities of the contingent events occurring.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P83_S0	Marketable Securities: The Company has evaluated its investment policies and determined that all of its investment securities are to be classified as available-for-sale.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P83_S1	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported in Stockholders Equity under the caption Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P83_S2	Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in Other expense (income).
1094392_13_ITEM15_P83_S3	The Company records other-than-temporary impairment charges for its available-for-sale investments when it intends to sell the securities, it is more-likely-than not that it will be required to sell the securities before a recovery, or when it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the securities.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P84_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P84_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company held one auction-rate security with a fair value of $346 .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P84_S2	The underlying asset of the Company s auction-rate security consisted of a municipal bond with an auction reset feature.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P84_S3	Due to auction failures in the marketplace, the Company will not have access to these funds unless (a) future auctions occur and are successful, (b) the security is called by the issuer, (c) the Company sells the security in an available secondary market, or (d) the underlying note matures.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P84_S4	Currently, there are no active secondary markets.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P85_S0	Company has recorded a cumulative temporary unrealized impairment loss of $129 within Accumulated other comprehensive loss based upon its assessment of the fair value of this security.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P85_S1	The Company believes that this impairment is temporary as it does not intend to sell this security, the Company will not be required to sell this security before recovery, and the Company expects to recover the amortized cost basis of these securities.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P85_S2	The Company has determined that the gross unrealized losses on its marketable securities at December 31, 2011 and 2012 are temporary in nature.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P85_S3	The Company reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P85_S4	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, credit quality and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P86_S0	At December 31, 2011 and 2012 , marketable securities are categorized as follows:
1094392_13_ITEM15_P87_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable securities classified by the maturity date listed on the security, regardless of the Consolidated Balance Sheet classification, is as follows at December 31, 2011 and 2012 :
1094392_13_ITEM15_P88_S0	The following table summarizes the estimated fair value and gross unrealized holding losses of marketable securities, aggregated by investment instrument and period of time in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2011 and 2012 .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P89_S0	See Note 4 for additional discussion regarding the fair value of the Company s marketable securities.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P90_S0	Goodwill The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows:

1094392_13_ITEM15_P101_S1	On and after April 15, 2016 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of July 15, 2016 , holders may convert their notes, in multiples of $1 principal amount, regardless of whether any of the foregoing conditions have been met.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P101_S2	Upon conversion, the Company will deliver to holders in respect of each $1 principal amount of Notes being converted a settlement amount equal to the sum of the daily settlement amounts for each of the 40 consecutive trading days during the applicable cash settlement averaging period.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P101_S3	The conversion value of each Note will be paid in: 1) cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be converted, and 2) to the extent the conversion value exceeds the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted, the Company s common stock in respect of the remainder (plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of common stock).
1094392_13_ITEM15_P101_S4	The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain circumstances but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.

1094392_13_ITEM15_P104_S0	The remaining bond discount of the Notes of $10,990 , as of December 31, 2012 will be amortized over the remaining life of the Notes.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P105_S0	Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, the Company purchased a convertible note hedge and sold a warrant.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P105_S1	Each of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions were entered into with an affiliate of the initial purchaser of the Notes (the Option Counterparty ).
1094392_13_ITEM15_P105_S2	The convertible note hedge is intended to reduce the potential future dilution to the Company s common stock associated with the conversion of the Notes.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P105_S3	However, the warrant transaction will have a dilutive effect on the Company s earnings per share to the extent that the price of the Company s common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrant.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P105_S4	The strike price of the warrant will initially be $17.00 per share.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P105_S5	Each of these components is discussed separately below: Convertible Note Hedge .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P106_S0	The Option Counterparty agreed to sell to the Company up to approximately 4,634 shares of the Company s common stock, which is the maximum number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, at a price of $12.95 per share.

1094392_13_ITEM15_P106_S2	Subject to certain terms and conditions, settlement of the convertible note hedge would result in the Company receiving shares of the Company s common stock equivalent to the number of shares that the Company is obligated to deliver to holders of the Notes upon conversion of the Notes.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P106_S3	The Company will not be required to make any cash payments to the Option Counterparty or its affiliates upon the exercise of the options that are a part of the convertible note hedge transaction, but will be entitled to receive from the Option Counterparty a number of shares of Company common stock generally based on the amount by which the market price per share of Company common stock, as measured under the terms of the convertible note hedge transaction, is greater than the strike price of the convertible note hedge transaction during the relevant valuation period under the convertible note hedge transaction.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P106_S4	The convertible note hedge transaction cost of $14,507 has been accounted for as an equity transaction.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P106_S5	The Company received $7,007 from the Option Counterparty from the sale of the warrant to purchase up to approximately 4,634 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $17.00 per share.

1094392_13_ITEM15_P106_S8	Additionally, if the market price per share of Company common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant transaction, exceeds the strike price of the warrant during the valuation period at the maturity of the warrant, the Company will owe the Option Counterparty a number of shares of Company common stock in an amount based on the excess of such market price per share of Company common stock over the strike price of the warrant.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P107_S0	The fair value of the warrant was initially recorded in equity and continues to be classified as equity.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P108_S0	The convertible note hedge transaction and the warrant transaction are separate transactions entered into by the Company.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P108_S1	Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the convertible note hedge transaction and the warrant transaction.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P109_S0	The Company has entered into agreements with customers that include limited intellectual property indemnification obligations that are customary in the industry.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P109_S1	These guarantees generally require the Company to compensate the other party for certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising from these transactions.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P110_S0	The nature of the intellectual property indemnification obligations prevents the Company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay to its customers.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P110_S1	Historically, the Company has not made any indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P111_S0	The Company generally provides a warranty on its products for a period of twelve to fifteen months against defects in material and workmanship.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P111_S1	The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred during the warranty period and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P111_S2	The Company s estimate is based primarily on historical experience.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P111_S3	The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P111_S4	Settlements of warranty reserves are generally associated with sales that occurred during the 12 to 15 months prior to the year-end and warranty accruals are related to sales during the year.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P111_S5	Changes in the Company s warranty reserves are as follows:
1094392_13_ITEM15_P112_S0	Legal Matters From time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P113_S0	As previously disclosed, in December 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of specific assets and liabilities of the semiconductor division of Applied Precision LLC ( Applied ).
1094392_13_ITEM15_P113_S1	As a result of the acquisition, the Company assumed certain liabilities of Applied including a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court, District of Arizona, by Integrated Technology Corporation ( ITC ) which alleged Applied's PrecisionPoint , PrecisionWoRx and ProbeWoRx products infringed an ITC patent (Integrated Technology Corporation v. Rudolph Technologies, Inc., No. CV-06-2182-PHX-ROS).
1094392_13_ITEM15_P113_S2	Prior to trial, the District Court ruled that such products sold prior to August of 2007 infringed the ITC patent.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P113_S3	In December 2011, a trial verdict was rendered in which the jury found that while the Company's products manufactured after August of 2007 did not literally infringe ITC's patent, the products were found to infringe under a rule known as the doctrine of equivalents, a legal principle which expands the language of patent claims to encompass products or processes which may otherwise be found not to literally infringe the patent.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P113_S4	The jury awarded $15,475 to ITC in damages for sales made during the years 2000-2011, of which award approximately one-half related to sales made after August 2007.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P114_S0	On July 23, 2012, the District Court, responding to post-trial motions filed by the Company and ITC related to the verdict and damages assessment, issued an Order which affirmed the jury's award, applied treble damages to the portion of the jury award related to sales of the products after 2007 and granted ITC's motion for attorney's fees and prejudgment interest on the verdict and attorney's fees.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P114_S1	The District Court also enjoined the Company from future infringement of the ITC patent and from selling or supplying the applicable products with the applicable features from or into the United States.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P114_S2	The Company appealed the injunction, the District Court Order and the damages assessment.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P114_S3	In October 2012, the injunction was stayed by the Federal Court of Appeals.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P114_S4	The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and shall continue to vigorously prosecute its appeal.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P114_S5	With that, it is reasonably possible that the Company could realize a loss in this matter related to products sold after August of 2007 such that in the event that the Company is ultimately found liable, damage estimates related to this case, which have not been accrued for as of December 31, 2012, range from approximately $25 to $31,641 .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P114_S6	With regard to products sold before August of 2007, it is probable that the Company could realize a loss in this matter for which the Company has estimated and recorded a liability of approximately $4,293 in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P114_S7	While the Company continues to believe that its current PrecisionWoRx and ProbeWoRx systems do not infringe ITC's patent, the Company reached an agreement with ITC in October 2012 with regards to a redesign of the products under which ITC agreed that such redesign is permissible under the court's injunction.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P115_S0	In the Company's patent infringement suit against Camtek, Ltd., of Migdal Hamek, Israel, concerning the Company's proprietary continuous scan wafer inspection technology, the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals issued a ruling on August 22, 2011.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P115_S1	In its opinion, the Appellate Court affirmed multiple rulings from trial at the District Court level including (i) finding the Company's U.S. Patent No. 6,826,298 valid, (ii) the part of the infringement ruling based on the finding that Camtek's Falcon product strobes based on velocity, and (iii) the dismissal of Camtek's claim against the Company for inequitable conduct against the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P115_S2	The court did, however, revise one claim construction ruling made by the District Court in the original case.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P115_S3	As a result, the Appellate Court set aside the verdict delivered by the jury for damages and the District Court's decision to enter an injunction against Camtek's selling Falcon tools in the U.S. and remanded the case back to the trial court for a limited trial on this the single infringement issue.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P115_S4	No trial date has been set for this limited trial.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P116_S0	This lawsuit was initially brought in 2005 by August Technology prior to its merger with the Company.

1094392_13_ITEM15_P119_S2	The Company s Board of Directors is entitled to redeem the Rights at $0.001 per Right at any time before a person has acquired 15% or more of the outstanding Rudolph common stock.

1094392_13_ITEM15_P135_S1	The Company did not make contributions to this program for the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2011 and 2012 .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P136_S0	Other Income (Expense): Other income (expense) is comprised of the following:
1094392_13_ITEM15_P137_S0	The components of income tax expense are as follows:
1094392_13_ITEM15_P138_S0	Income before tax of $16,284 and $14,253 was generated by domestic and foreign operations, respectively, in 2010 .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P138_S1	Income (loss) before tax of $23,963 and $(3,569) was generated by domestic and foreign operations, respectively, in 2011 .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P138_S2	Income before tax of $13,278 and $16,129 was generated by domestic and foreign operations, respectively, in 2012 .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P138_S3	The income tax benefit of $4,832 and $14,458 in 2011 and 2012, respectively, primarily resulted from benefits related to the release of valuation allowance recorded against U.S. deferred tax assets, partially offset by taxes accrued in both the U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P139_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised of the following:
1094392_13_ITEM15_P140_S0	At December 31, 2011 and 2012 , we had valuation allowances of $24,674 and $1,361 on certain of our deferred tax assets to reflect the deferred tax asset at the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P140_S1	The Company released $23,313 in valuation allowance after it evaluated the realizability of the federal and state deferred tax assets based on positive earnings for the past three years as well as the projected earnings in future years and believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized in the future years.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P140_S2	The Company will continue to monitor the realizability of the deferred tax asset and evaluate the valuation allowance.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P141_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company uses a more likely than not standard.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P141_S1	If it is determined that it is more-likely-than-not that deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against the deferred tax assets.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P142_S0	The ultimate realization of the assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences become deductible.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P142_S1	Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies when making this assessment.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P143_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% for the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2011 and 2012 to income before provision for income taxes as follows:
1094392_13_ITEM15_P144_S0	At December 31, 2012 , the Company had state net operating loss carryforwards of $13,687 .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P144_S1	The net operating loss carryforwards expire on various dates through December 31, 2030 .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P144_S2	At December 31, 2012 , the Company had federal and state research development credits and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $3,406 , $1,859 and $2,145 , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P144_S3	state research development credits are set to expire at various dates through December 21, 2023 .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P144_S4	The foreign tax credit is set to expire at various dates through December 31, 2019 .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P144_S5	A provision has not been made at December 31, 2012 for U.S. or additional foreign withholding taxes on approximately $3,147 of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in Europe and Japan because it is the present intention of management to permanently reinvest these undistributed earnings.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P144_S6	Upon distribution of those earnings, U.S. taxes on such permanently reinvested foreign earnings would be recorded net of applicable foreign tax credits and withholding taxes, if any.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P144_S7	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:
1094392_13_ITEM15_P145_S0	Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011 and 2012 are unrecognized tax benefits of $6,118 and $6,272 which would be reflected as an adjustment to income tax expense if recognized, respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P145_S1	It is reasonably possible that certain amounts of unrecognized tax benefits may reverse in the next 12 months; however, we do not expect such reversals would have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P146_S0	The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P146_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , the Company recognized approximately $27 , $330 and $557 in interest and penalties expense associated with uncertain tax positions, respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P146_S2	As of December 31, 2011 and 2012 , the Company had accrued interest and penalties expense related to unrecognized tax benefits of $566 and $1,538 , respectively.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P147_S0	The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P147_S1	Presently, the Company is under a federal income tax examination by the Internal Revenue Service for examination of income tax returns for the tax years ended, December 31, 2007 through December 31, 2009 .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P147_S2	The Company has not been contacted by any other U.S. state, local or foreign tax authority for all open tax periods beginning after December 31, 2007 .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P148_S0	The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was passed by Congress and signed into law on January 1, 2013.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P148_S1	The provisions under this law were made retroactive to January 1, 2012.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P148_S2	However, as a result of the law being signed on January 1, 2013, the financial impact of any retroactive provision will be recorded as a discrete event in the first quarter of 2013.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P148_S3	The Company estimates that this discrete event will reduce tax expense in the first quarter of 2013 by approximately $800 for research and development tax credits for 2012.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P149_S0	The Company has one reportable segment.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P150_S0	Operating segments are business units that have separate financial information and are separately reviewed by the Company s chief decision maker.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P151_S0	The Company s chief decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P152_S0	The Company is engaged in the design, development, manufacture and support of high-performance control metrology, defect inspection, advanced packaging lithography and data analysis systems used by microelectronics device manufacturers.

1094392_13_ITEM15_P153_S1	The chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses performance of the business and other activities at the reporting segment level.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P153_S2	The following table lists the different sources of revenue:
1094392_13_ITEM15_P154_S0	The Company s significant operations outside the United States include sales, service and application offices in Europe and Asia.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P155_S0	For geographical reporting, revenues are attributed to the geographic location in which the product is shipped.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P155_S1	Revenue by geographic region is as follows:
1094392_13_ITEM15_P156_S0	In 2010 , sales to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Semiconductor Inc. accounted for 13.9% and 11.2% of our revenues, respectively.

1094392_13_ITEM15_P158_S0	Basic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P158_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed in the same manner and also gives effect to all dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P158_S2	Potential common shares that would have the effect of increasing diluted earnings per share are considered to be antidilutive.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P158_S3	In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these shares were not included in calculating diluted earnings per share.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P158_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2010 , the weighted average number of stock options and restricted stock units excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share were 2,059 and 446 .
1094392_13_ITEM15_P158_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2011 , the weighted average number of stock options and restricted stock units excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share were 1,257 and 291 , respectively.

1094392_13_ITEM15_P158_S7	Diluted earnings per share-weighted average shares outstanding do not include any effect resulting from assumed conversion of the Notes and warrants (as described in Note 8) as their impact would be anti-dilutive.
1094392_13_ITEM15_P159_S0	The computations of basic and diluted income per share for the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 are as follows:

1094392_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	Rudolph systems are backed by worldwide customer service and applications support.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	Driven by market demand for 3D measurement capability in advanced packaging applications, Rudolph acquired selected assets of Tamar Technology ( Tamar ), a precision metrology company, of Newbury Park, CA, in April 2013.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	Tamar s measurement technology is well recognized within the semiconductor industry and was already in use at a number of major manufacturers.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	platform for a combined inspection and metrology system, the NSX Metrology Series, to meet our customers need for throughput and process integration in high-volume production advanced packaging applications.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	In 2013 Rudolph earned certification to ISO 9001:2008 from SAI Global, an accredited registrar, for its quality management system and shared services corporate departments at its inspection, metrology and software business unit locations.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	The rigorous certification process reinforces the Company s commitment to providing the best quality products and services to its customers for the design, manufacture, sale and support of capital equipment and process control software used for inspection, metrology, yield analysis and control of semiconductor and related device manufacturing processes.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P4_S2	The Company will pursue ISO 9001:2008 registration for its new lithography systems group in 2014.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	Two acquisitions in 2012 strengthened Rudolph s established presence in Integrated Circuit and Flat Panel Display ( FPD ) manufacturing by adding to its substantial intellectual property portfolio.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	In June, the Company acquired specific assets and liabilities of NanoPhotonics GmbH, Mainz, Germany ( NanoPhotonics acquisition ) and added unpatterned wafer inspection to its product offering.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P5_S2	In December, the Company acquired Azores Corporation, Wilmington, Massachusetts, ( Azores acquisition ) and announced entry into the advanced packaging and FPD lithography markets.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P5_S3	Prior to the acquisition, Rudolph partnered with Azores (a manufacturer of lithography steppers for the FPD industry) to design and build a lithography stepper for the semiconductor advanced packaging market.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P5_S4	The first system shipped to a major Outsourced Assembly and Test ( OSAT ) customer in the fourth quarter of 2012.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	Industry Trends Advanced Packaging is a key technology that enables the miniaturization of electronic products, such as portable consumer devices, including smartphones and laptops.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	In electronics manufacturing, integrated circuit packaging is the final stage of semiconductor device fabrication, in which the tiny block of semiconducting material (die) is encased in a supporting package that provides an external electrical connection and prevents physical damage and corrosion.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	Packaging refers loosely to the conductors and other structures that interconnect the circuits, feed them with electric power, discharge their heat and protect them from damage.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	Today, the drive to pack more functions into a small space and reduce their power requirements demands that chip packages do much more than ever before.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P7_S3	Examples of advanced packaging are varied and include flip-chip bumping, pillar bumping, wafer-level chip scale packaging and 3D packaging.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P7_S4	One solution using advanced packaging is the 3D integration of semiconductors and other devices.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P7_S5	The technology involves stacking individual die or wafers in one integrated housing.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P7_S6	Through silicon vias (TSV, 3D stacking) allow communication among the individual components.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P7_S7	This offers the advantages of shorter signal paths and reduced power consumption, enhanced bandwidths, integration of heterogeneous components such as sub-chips, smaller surface area and reduced expense.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P7_S8	The processes required for 3D integration are still being optimized for yield, and to ensure the functioning of individual microchips.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	The current and projected adoption of smart mobile devices drives designed-in capability.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	There are no longer single function devices, but instead, various devices have been combined to provide multiple functions.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	For example, smart phone users no longer need a GPS, digital camera and PDA.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P8_S3	With the addition of a myriad of available apps, the potential uses seem endless.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P8_S4	As a result, advancements in mobile products are driving semiconductor advanced packaging and display manufacturers to implement next-generation technologies to meet the resulting requirements.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P8_S5	This technology shift has created multiple opportunities for Rudolph solutions.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	Scalable technology is rapidly increasing in importance.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	Advanced packaging facilities looking to improve cost of ownership (COO) and increase productivity are transitioning to large panels ranging up to Gen 3.5 (approximately 650mm x 720mm).
1094392_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	Traditional technology has been limited to standard wafer sizes.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	However, with companies progressively moving to fan-out packages, they are no longer limited to operating within the constraints of a round wafer.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	By responding to market opportunities and addressing the stringent demands of customers technical roadmaps, Rudolph is optimally positioned to capitalize on the emerging market of advanced packaging panel lithography.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	The JetStep Panel Lithography System, having emerged from the flat panel display market, is readily capable of processing both glass and organic laminate panels in the semiconductor advanced packaging market.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	Multiple Rudolph systems continue to support 450mm wafer processing research and development.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	value of inspection and metrology data to improve process yields and profitability as the industry moves toward a full 450mm production ramp.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	Technology We believe that our expertise in engineering and our continued investment in research and development enable us to rapidly develop new technologies and products in response to emerging industry trends.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	The breadth of our technology enables us to offer a diverse combination of measurement technologies that provide process control for the majority of thin films used in semiconductor manufacturing.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P14_S2	Unique features have been designed into our lithography systems to meet our customers changing process requirements.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P14_S3	Our defect detection and classification technologies allow us to provide yield enhancement for critical front-end processes such as photolithography, diffusion, etch, CMP and outgoing quality control.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	Information learned through post-fab inspection is critical.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	Advanced macro defect inspection within the final manufacturing (back-end) process provides our customers with critical quality assurance and process information.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing or general handling, and can have a major impact on device and process quality.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	Chip manufacturers deploy advanced macro defect inspection throughout the fab to monitor key process steps, gather process-enhancing information and ultimately, lower manufacturing costs.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	Field-established tools such as the F30 and NSX inspection systems are found in wafer processing (front-end) and final manufacturing (back-end) facilities around the world.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P16_S3	These high-speed tools incorporate features such as waferless recipe creation, tool-to-tool correlation and multiple inspection resolutions.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P16_S4	In addition to wafer frontside inspection, Rudolph s innovative Explorer Inspection Cluster incorporates wafer edge and backside inspection in one integrated platform to enhance productivity and continuously improve fab yield.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P16_S5	New products added in 2013 include the NSX Metrology Series for advanced packaging manufacturers and the NSX 220 System for fast, easy defect inspection at traditional back-end facilities.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Using products such as Discover and Genesis yield management software, the vast amount of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed and classified to determine trends that ultimately affect yield.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	All-surface refers to inspection of the wafer frontside, edge, and backside as well as post-fab die.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	The edge inspection process focuses on the area near the wafer edge, an area that poses difficulty for traditional wafer frontside inspection technology due to its varied topography and process variation.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	Edge bevel inspection looks for defects on the side edge of a wafer.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	The edge bead removal and edge exclusion metrology involve a topside surface measurement required exclusively in the photolithography process, primarily to determine if wafers have been properly aligned for the edge exclusion region.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	The primary reason for wafer backside inspection is to determine if contamination has been created that may spread throughout the fab.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	For instance, it is critical that the wafer backside be free of defects prior to the photolithography process to prevent focus and exposure problems on the wafer front-side.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	Automating the defect detection and classification process is best done by a system that can mimic, or even extend, the response of the human eye, but at a much higher speed, with high resolution and more consistency.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	To do this, our systems capture full-color whole wafer images using simultaneous dark and bright field illumination.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	The resulting bright and dark field images are compared to those from an ideal wafer having no defects.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P22_S3	When a difference is detected, its image is broken down into mathematical vectors that allow rapid and accurate comparison with a library of known classified defects stored in the tool s database.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P22_S4	Patented and proprietary enhancements of this approach enable very fast and highly repeatable image classification.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P22_S5	The system is pre-programmed with an extensive library of default local, global and color defects and can also absorb a virtually unlimited amount of new defect classes.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P22_S6	This allows customers to define defects based on their existing defect classification system, provides more reliable automated rework decisions and enables more accurate statistical process control data.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P22_S7	Classifying defects off-line enables automated inspection systems to maintain their high throughput.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P22_S8	Using defect image files captured by automated inspection systems, operators are able to view high-resolution defect images to determine defects that cause catastrophic failure of a device, or killer defects.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	defects of similar types across a wafer lot to be grouped based on size, repeating defects and other user-defined specifications.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	Automatically classifying defects provides far greater yield learning than human classification.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	Using wafer maps, charts and graphs, the vast amounts of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed to determine trends across bumps, die, wafers and lots.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	This analysis may determine where in the process a variation is being introduced, allowing for enhancements to be made and yields improved.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	Defect data analysis is performed to identify, analyze and locate the source of defects and other manufacturing process excursions.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	Using either a single wafer map or a composite map created from multiple wafer maps, this analysis enables identification of defect patterns and distribution.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P25_S2	When combined with inspection data from strategically-placed inspection points, this analysis may pinpoint the source of the defects so corrective action can be taken.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P25_S3	The combination of Fast 3D-OCM (optical comparative metrology) Technology with improved testing accuracy and repeatability is designed to reduce total test time for even the most advanced large area probe cards.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P25_S4	3-D capabilities enable users to analyze probe marks and probe tips in a rapid and information-rich format.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	Lithography Business Step and Repeat Technology.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	Rudolph steppers use projection optics to expose circuit patterns from a mask or reticle onto a substrate to achieve images with optimal fidelity.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	These systems employ light from a mercury arc lamp that is transmitted through a mask or reticle containing display circuit patterns.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	Substrates are aligned on the system and the mask is imaged through a projection lens in photoresist material coated on the substrate.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P28_S2	The substrate is then moved, or stepped, to a second position to expose an adjacent area.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P28_S3	Images can be stitched together precisely to form larger circuit patterns without any noticeable change in circuit performance.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P28_S4	The system repeats the step and exposure process until the entire substrate is patterned.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P28_S5	Once the exposure process has been completed, the substrate is developed with an alkali solution, such as Tetramethylammonium Hydroxide ( TMAH ) or sodium hydroxide ( NaOH ), to reveal the underlying material.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P28_S6	The imaged photoresist serves as a barrier that allows for processing the underlying metal or insulating layers.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P28_S7	The substrates then continue through the etching, stripping and deposition processes until multi-layer circuits are completed.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	In order to deal with increased Input/Output, enhanced functionality, power efficiency and higher frequency, Integrated Device Manufacturers and OSATs are moving to advanced packaging technologies such as Through Silicon Via ( TSV ) and 3D.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	However, the associated substrates and processes are significantly different than those used in front-end wafer processing.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P29_S2	The added performance requires finer features, but the processes stress the substrates resulting in warped substrates.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	Since most packaging is an additive process, thick films are used to enable the creation of features.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	In order for equipment to effectively function in this environment, it must overcome these challenges.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	The Rudolph JetStep System has been specifically designed to meet these challenges head on.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P30_S3	A large printable field combined with user-selectable wavelength options maximizes throughput while not limiting resolution when needed.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P30_S4	High fidelity optics are able to image the fine features required while at the same time achieving superior depth of field to minimize non-flatness effects.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P30_S5	On-the-fly auto focus and an innovative reticle management system improve yield and utilization.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P30_S6	These unique features result in a revolutionary lithography system specifically designed to meet advanced packaging challenges.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	Flat Panel Display (FPD) Lithography .
1094392_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	A critical aspect of any leading mobile device is the display.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	The display serves as the window to the user.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	Therefore, it must effectively present graphics such as detailed maps, high resolution photos and streaming video in order to meet user expectations.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P32_S3	To accomplish this, the display transistor backplane, which is what controls the pixels, must operate at a high frequency and have high pixel resolution.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P32_S4	As a result, the transistors must have high mobility and only use a small portion of the pixel aperture.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	The backplane is manufactured on a sheet of glass; like the packaging substrate, it is non-flat and tends to distort further during processing.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	Additionally, the displays are getting larger.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	Manufacturers are looking to utilize larger sheets of glass, making throughput a challenge for the lithography equipment.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P33_S3	To overcome this, Rudolph s PanelPrinter 9200 uses high-fidelity optics and the largest printable stepper field available enabling more displays per shoot.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P33_S4	This feature, combined with on-the-fly auto-focus and magnification compensation, maximizes throughput and yield.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P33_S5	Finally, the innovative grid stage allows the system to be easily scaled to meet the customer desired substrate size.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	Rudolph s patented transparent film technology uses up to four lasers operating simultaneously at multiple angles and multiple wavelengths, providing powerful analysis and measurement capabilities.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	Unlike the white-light sources used in spectroscopic ellipsometers, laser light sources make our metrology tools inherently stable, increase measurement speed and accuracy, and reduce maintenance costs by minimizing the time required to re-qualify a light source when it is replaced.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	New in 2013, Rudolph s S3000SX System is targeted for transparent films in advanced semiconductor fabrication applications at the 28nm node and below.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	This latest addition to the S3000 product family uses Rudolph s proprietary focused beam ellipsometry (FBE) and newly-designed small site measurement optics (SSMO) to measure the thickness of single layer and multi-layer films on product wafers including device area at site sizes as small as 30x30 nanometers.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	The Meta PULSE System gives customers the ability to simultaneously measure the thickness and other properties of up to six metal or other opaque film layers in a non-contact manner on product wafers.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	PULSE Technology uses an ultra-fast laser to generate sound waves that pass down through a stack of opaque films such as those used in copper or aluminum interconnect processes, sending back to the surface an echo that indicates film thickness, density, and other process critical parameters.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	We believe we are a leader in providing systems that can non-destructively measure opaque thin-film stacks with the speed and accuracy semiconductor device manufacturers demand in order to achieve high yields with the latest fabrication processes.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P36_S2	The technology is ideal for characterizing copper interconnect structures.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P36_S3	The Meta PULSE System, used mainly for fast and accurate measurements of metal interconnect in front-end wafer processing applications, has now been chosen by back-end manufacturers to perform system measurements in new process applications, driven by the need for on-product metrology as feature sizes decrease and pattern densities increase.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P36_S4	In addition, the Meta PULSE FP system was selected during 2012 by a major manufacturer of flat panel displays to measure critical thickness of metal layers deposited during the manufacturing process and this relationship continues through 2013.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	Optical acoustic metrology involves the use of ultra-fast laser induced sonar for metal and opaque thin film measurement.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	This technology sends ultrasonic waves into multi-layer opaque films and then analyzes the resulting echoes to simultaneously determine the thickness of each individual layer in complex multi-layer metal film stacks.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P37_S2	The echo s amplitude and phase can be used to detect film properties, missing layers and interlayer problems.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P37_S3	Since different phenomena affect amplitude and phase uniquely, a variety of process critical interlayer problems can be detected in a single measurement.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	The use of optical acoustics to measure multi-layer metal and opaque films was pioneered by scientists at Brown University ( Brown ) in collaboration with engineers at Rudolph.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	The proprietary optical acoustic technology in our PULSE Technology systems measures the thickness of single or multi-layer opaque films ranging from less than 40 Angstroms to greater than five microns.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P38_S2	It provides these measurements at a rate of up to 70 wafers per hour within one to two percent accuracy and typically less than one percent repeatability.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P38_S3	This range of thicknesses covers the majority of thick and thin metal films projected by the International Roadmap for Semiconductors to be used through the end of this decade.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our non-contact, non-destructive optical acoustic technology and small spot size enable our PULSE Technology systems to measure film properties directly on product wafers.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	Ellipsometry is a non-contact, non-destructive optical technique for transparent thin film measurement.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	We have been an industry leader in ellipsometry technology for the last three decades.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P40_S2	We hold patents on several ellipsometry technologies, including our proprietary technique that uses four lasers for multiple-angle of incidence, multiple wavelength ellipsometry.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P40_S3	Laser ellipsometry technology is intended to enable our transparent film systems to provide the increasingly higher level of accuracy needed as thinner films and newer materials are introduced for future generations of semiconductor devices.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P40_S4	We extended this same optical technology to characterize the scatterometry signal from patterned surfaces, allowing measurement of critical dimensions.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P40_S5	For applications requiring broader spectral coverage, some of our ellipsometry tools are also equipped with a reflectometer.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	Reflectometry uses a white or ultraviolet light source to determine the properties of transparent thin films by analyzing the wavelength and intensity of light reflected from the surface of a wafer.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	This optical information is processed with software algorithms to determine film thickness and other material properties.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P41_S2	By combining data from both the laser ellipsometer and broad spectrum reflectometer, it is possible to characterize films and film stacks that cannot be adequately analyzed by either method individually.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	Yield Management and Process Control Software Process Control .
1094392_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	We provide a wide range of advanced process control solutions, all designed to improve factory profitability, including run-to-run control, fault detection, classification and tool automation.

1094392_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	In the years 2011 , 2012 and 2013 , sales to end user customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for 43.6% , 50.9% and 41.6% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	No other individual end user customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2011 , 2012 and 2013 .
1094392_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	We do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	Research and Development The markets for equipment and systems for manufacturing semiconductor devices and for performing macro-defect inspection, advanced packaging lithography and thin film transparent and opaque process control metrology are characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	We believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products is critical to our success.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P50_S2	Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our technical, management and financial resources to research and development programs.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P50_S3	As of December 31, 2013 , we employed 169 research and development personnel.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P50_S4	The core competencies of our research and development team include metrology systems for high volume manufacturing, ellipsometry, ultra-fast optics, picosecond acoustic and optical design, advanced metrology application development and algorithm development.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P50_S5	To leverage our internal research and development capabilities, we maintain close relationships with leading research institutions in the metrology field, including Brown University.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P50_S6	Our relationship with Brown University has resulted in the development of the optical acoustic technology underlying our Meta PULSE product line.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P50_S7	We have been granted exclusive licenses from Brown University Research Foundation, subject to rights retained by Brown and the United States government for their own non-commercial uses for several patents relating to this technology.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P50_S8	Our research and development expenditures in 2011 , 2012 and 2013 were $36.3 million , $39.3 million and $40.0 million , respectively.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P50_S9	We plan to continue our strong commitment to new product development and continue to allocate significant resources to these efforts in the future.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	We maintain an extensive network of direct sales, customer service and application support offices in the United States, Europe and Asia.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	We provide our customers with comprehensive support before, during and after the delivery of our products.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P51_S2	For example, in order to facilitate the smooth integration of our tools into our customers operations, we often assign dedicated, site-specific field service and applications engineers to provide long-term support at selected customer sites.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P51_S3	We also provide comprehensive service and applications training for customers at our training facilities in Bloomington, Minnesota and Budd Lake, New Jersey and at customer locations.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P51_S4	In addition, we maintain a group of highly skilled applications scientists at strategically located facilities throughout the world and at selected customer locations.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P51_S5	As of December 31, 2013 , we employed 294 sales and marketing, service and applications support personnel.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	Manufacturing Our principal manufacturing activities include assembly, final test and calibration.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	These activities are conducted in our manufacturing facilities in Bloomington, Minnesota and Wilmington, Massachusetts.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P52_S2	Our core manufacturing competencies include electrical, optical and mechanical assembly and testing, as well as the management of new product transitions.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P52_S3	While we use standard components and subassemblies wherever possible, most mechanical parts, metal fabrications and critical components used in our products are engineered and manufactured to our specifications.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P52_S4	We continue to rely on subcontractors and turnkey suppliers to fabricate components, build assemblies and perform other non-core activities in a cost-effective manner.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P52_S5	As of December 31, 2013 , we employed 84 manufacturing personnel.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P52_S6	We rely on a number of limited source suppliers for certain parts and subassemblies.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P52_S7	This reliance creates a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components, and reduced control over pricing and time of delivery of components.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P52_S8	An inability to obtain adequate supplies would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or might require us to redesign our systems to accommodate different components or subassemblies.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P52_S9	To date, we have not experienced any significant delivery delays.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P52_S10	However, if we were forced to seek alternative sources of supply, manufacture such components or subassemblies internally, or redesign our products, this could prevent us from shipping our products to our customers on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	We have a policy of seeking patents on inventions governing new products or technologies as part of our ongoing research, development, and manufacturing activities.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P53_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , we have been granted, or hold exclusive licenses to, 251 U.S. and foreign patents.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P53_S2	The patents we own, jointly own or exclusively license have expiration dates ranging from 2014 to 2031 .
1094392_14_ITEM1_P53_S3	We also have 112 pending regular and provisional applications in the U.S. and other countries.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P53_S4	Our patents and applications principally cover various aspects of macro-defect detection and classification, transparent thin film measurement and altered material characterization.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P53_S5	We have been granted exclusive licenses from Brown University Research Foundation, subject to rights retained by Brown and the United States government for their own non-commercial uses, for several patents relating to the optical acoustic technology underlying our Meta PULSE product family.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P53_S6	The terms of these exclusive licenses are equal to the lives of the patents.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P53_S7	We pay royalties to Brown based upon a percentage of our revenues from the sale of systems that incorporate technology covered by the Brown patents.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P53_S8	We also have the right to support patent activity with respect to new ultra-fast acoustic technology developed by Brown scientists, and to acquire exclusive licenses to this technology.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P53_S9	Brown may terminate the licenses if we fail to pay royalties to Brown or if we materially breach our license agreement with Brown.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P53_S10	Our pending patents may never be issued, and even if they are, these patents, our existing patents and the patents we license may not provide sufficiently broad protection to protect our proprietary rights, or they may prove to be unenforceable.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P53_S11	To protect our proprietary rights, we also rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions and licenses.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P53_S12	There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same degree as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial infringement problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in such countries, some of which are countries in which we have sold and continue to sell products.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	There is a risk that our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P54_S2	For example, our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P54_S3	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	Competition The market for semiconductor capital equipment is highly competitive.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	We face substantial competition from established companies in each of the markets that we serve.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P55_S2	We principally compete with KLA-Tencor, Camtek and Ultratech.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P55_S3	We compete to a lesser extent with companies such as Nanometrics and Nikon.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P55_S4	Each of our products also competes with products that use different metrology techniques.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, broader product offerings and service capabilities and larger installed customer bases than we do.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	Significant competitive factors in the market for inspection and metrology systems include system performance, ease of use, reliability, cost of ownership, technical support and customer relationships.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P56_S2	We believe that, while price and delivery are important competitive factors, the customers overriding requirement is for a product that meets their technical capabilities.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P56_S3	To remain competitive, we believe we will need to maintain a high level of investment in research and development and process applications.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P56_S4	No assurances can be given that we will continue to be competitive in the future.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	Backlog We schedule production of our systems based upon order backlog and informal customer forecasts.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	We include in backlog only those orders to which the customer has assigned a purchase order number and for which delivery is anticipated within 12 months.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	Because shipment dates may be changed and customers may cancel or delay orders with little or no penalty, our backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P57_S3	At December 31, 2013 , we had a backlog of approximately $30.8 million compared with a backlog of approximately $27.2 million at December 31, 2012 .
1094392_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	Employees As of December 31, 2013 , we had 615 employees.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P58_S1	Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements, and we have never experienced a work stoppage.
1094392_14_ITEM1_P58_S2	We believe our employee relations are good.

1094392_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Risks Related to Rudolph Our operating results have varied, and will likely continue to vary significantly, from quarter to quarter in the future, causing volatility in our stock price Our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and will likely continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, causing volatility in our stock price.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Some of the factors that may influence our operating results and subject our stock to extreme price and volume fluctuations include:
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	the levels of our fixed expenses, including research and development costs associated with product development, relative to our revenue levels.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In light of these factors and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Moreover, many of our expenses are fixed in the short-term which, together with the need for continued investment in research and development, marketing and customer support, limits our ability to reduce expenses quickly.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	As a result, declines in net sales could harm our business and the price of our common stock could substantially decline.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our largest customers account for a significant portion of our revenues, and our revenues and cash flows could significantly decline if one or more of these customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems or they delayed or canceled a large order Sales to end user customers that individually represent at least five percent of our revenues typically account for, in the aggregate, a considerable amount of our revenues.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We operate in the highly concentrated, capital-intensive semiconductor device manufacturing industry.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Historically, a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers, and this trend is expected to continue.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	If any of our key customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems in the future, or if a large order were delayed or canceled, our revenues and cash flows could significantly decline.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We expect that we will continue to depend on a small number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenues.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P2_S4	In addition, as large semiconductor device manufacturers seek to establish closer relationships with their suppliers, we expect that our customer base will become even more concentrated.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Our customers may be unable to pay us for our products and services Our customers include some companies that may from time to time encounter financial difficulties, especially in light of the current economic environment and the difficulties in the credit markets.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P2_S6	If a customer s financial difficulties become severe, the customer may be unwilling or unable to pay our invoices in the ordinary course of business, which could adversely affect collections of both our accounts receivable and unbilled services.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P2_S7	The bankruptcy of a customer with a substantial account receivable could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P2_S8	In addition, if a customer declares bankruptcy after paying us certain invoices, a court may determine that we are not properly entitled to that payment and may require repayment of some or all of the amount we received, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P2_S9	Variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our systems may cause fluctuations in our operating results, which could cause our stock price to decline Variations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our revenues and cash flows, and consequently, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, to fluctuate widely from period to period.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P2_S10	This variation could cause our stock price to decline.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P2_S11	Our customers generally take a long time to evaluate our inspection and/or film metrology systems and many people are involved in the evaluation process.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P2_S12	We expend significant resources educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our systems in the semiconductor fabrication process.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P2_S13	The length of time it takes for us to make a sale depends upon many factors including, but not limited to:
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	the quality and sophistication of the customer s current metrology, inspection or lithography equipment.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Because of the number of factors influencing the sales process, the period between our initial contact with a customer and the time when we recognize revenue from that customer and receive payment, if ever, varies widely in length.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our sales cycles, including the time it takes for us to build a product to customer specifications after receiving an order to the time we recognize revenue, typically range from six to 15 months.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Sometimes our sales cycles can be much longer, particularly with customers in Japan.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	During these cycles, we commit substantial resources to our sales efforts in advance of receiving any revenue, and we may never receive any revenue from a customer despite our sales efforts.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	If we do make a sale, our customers often purchase only one of our systems, and then evaluate its performance for a lengthy period before purchasing any more of our systems.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P4_S5	The number of additional products a customer purchases, if any, depends on many factors, including the customer s capacity requirements.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P4_S6	The period between a customer s initial purchase and any subsequent purchases can vary from six months to a year or longer, and variations in the length of this period could cause further fluctuations in our operating results and possibly in our stock price.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Most of our revenues have been derived from customers outside of the United States subjecting us to operational, financial and political risks, such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs, political and economic instability, outbreaks of hostilities, and difficulties in managing foreign sales representatives and foreign branch operations Due to the significant level of our international sales, we are subject to a number of material risks, including: Compliance with foreign laws.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our business is subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally, including compliance with, inconsistencies among, and unexpected changes in, a wide variety of foreign laws and regulatory environments with which we are not familiar, including, among other issues, with respect to employees, protection of our intellectual property, and a wide variety of operational regulations and trade and export controls under domestic, foreign, and international law.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including tariffs and other market barriers.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The semiconductor device industry is a high-visibility industry in many of the European and Asian countries in which we sell our products.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Because the governments of these countries have provided extensive financial support to our semiconductor device manufacturing customers in these countries, we believe that our customers could be disproportionately affected by any trade embargoes, excise taxes or other restrictions imposed by their governments on trade with United States companies such as ourselves.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Any restrictions of these types could result in a reduction in our sales to customers in these countries.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We are subject to various global risks related to political and economic instabilities in countries in which we derive sales.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If terrorist activities, armed conflict, civil or military unrest or political instability occurs outside of the U.S., these events may result in reduced demand for our products.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	There is considerable political instability in Taiwan related to its disputes with China and in South Korea related to its disputes with North Korea.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In addition, several Asian countries, particularly Japan, have experienced significant economic instability.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	An outbreak of hostilities or other political upheaval in China, Taiwan or South Korea, or an economic downturn in Japan or other countries, would likely harm the operations of our customers in these countries.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The effect of these types of events on our revenues and cash flows could be material because we derive substantial revenues from sales to semiconductor device foundries in Taiwan such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd., from memory chip manufacturers in South Korea such as Samsung, and from semiconductor device manufacturers in Japan such as Toshiba.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign branch operations.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	During periods of tension between the governments of the United States and certain other countries, it is often difficult for United States companies such as ourselves to staff and manage operations in such countries.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Language and other cultural differences may also inhibit our sales and marketing efforts and create internal communication problems among our U.S. and foreign research and development teams, increasing the difficulty of managing multiple, remote locations performing various development, quality assurance, and yield ramp analysis projects.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Currency fluctuations as compared to the U.S. Dollar.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	A substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As a result, if the dollar rises in value in relation to foreign currencies, our systems will become more expensive to customers outside the United States and less competitive with systems produced by competitors outside the United States.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	These conditions could negatively impact our international sales.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Foreign sales also expose us to collection risk in the event it becomes more expensive for our foreign customers to convert their local currencies into U.S. dollars.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Additionally, in the event a larger portion of our revenue becomes denominated in foreign currencies, we would be subject to a potentially significant exchange rate risk.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P10_S6	If we deliver systems with defects, our credibility will be harmed and the sales and market acceptance of our systems will decrease Our systems are complex and have occasionally contained errors, defects and bugs when introduced.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing or general handling, and can have a major impact on device and process quality.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	When this occurs, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our systems could be harmed.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Further, if our systems contain errors, defects or bugs, computer viruses or malicious code as a result of cyber attacks to our computer networks, we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate these problems.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Defects could also lead to product liability as a result of product liability lawsuits against us or against our customers.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We have agreed to indemnify our customers under certain circumstances against liability arising from defects in our systems.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Our product liability policy currently provides $2.0 million of aggregate coverage, with an overall umbrella limit of $14.0 million .
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	In the event of a successful product liability claim, we could be obligated to pay damages significantly in excess of our product liability insurance limits.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If we are not successful in developing new and enhanced products for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry, we will lose market share to our competitors We operate in an industry that is highly competitive and subject to evolving industry standards, rapid technological changes, rapid changes in consumer demands and the rapid introduction of new, higher performance systems with shorter product life cycles.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	To be competitive in our demanding market, we must continually design, develop and introduce in a timely manner new inspection, lithography and film metrology systems that meet the performance and price demands of semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We must also continue to refine our current systems so that they remain competitive.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	We expect to continue to make significant investments in our research and development activities.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We may experience difficulties or delays in our development efforts with respect to new systems, and we may not ultimately be successful in our product enhancement efforts to improve and advance products or in responding effectively to technological change, as not all research and development activities result in viable commercial products.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P13_S5	In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to develop new products for the most opportunistic new markets and applications.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Any significant delay in releasing new systems could cause our products to become obsolete, adversely affect our reputation, give a competitor a first-to-market advantage or cause a competitor to achieve greater market share.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P13_S7	In addition, new product offerings that are highly complex in terms of software or hardware may require application or service work such as bug fixing prior to acceptance, thereby delaying revenue recognition.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P13_S8	If new products developed by us do not gain general market acceptance, we will be unable to generate revenues and recover our research and development costs Inspection, lithography and metrology product development is inherently risky because it is difficult to foresee developments in semiconductor device manufacturing technology, coordinate technical personnel, and identify and eliminate system design flaws.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P13_S9	Further, our products are complex and often the applications to our customers businesses are unique.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P13_S10	Any new systems we introduce may not achieve or sustain a significant degree of market acceptance and sales.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P13_S11	We expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources developing new systems and refining our existing systems.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P13_S12	In light of the long product development cycles inherent in our industry, these expenditures will be made well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenue from the sale of those systems.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P13_S13	Our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market new systems are subject to a wide variety of challenges during the development cycle, including start-up bugs, design defects, and other matters that could delay introduction of these systems.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	materialize, or orders that are placed may be canceled.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	As a result, if we do not achieve market acceptance of new products, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows to recover our research and development costs and our market share, revenue, operating results or stock price would be negatively impacted.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Even if we are able to develop new products that gain market acceptance, sales of these new products could impair our ability to sell existing products Competition from our new systems could have a negative effect on sales of our existing systems and the prices that we could charge for these systems.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We may also divert sales and marketing resources from our current systems in order to successfully launch and promote our new or next generation systems.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P14_S4	This diversion of resources could have a further negative effect on sales of our current systems and the value of inventory.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P14_S5	If our relationships with our large customers deteriorate, our product development activities could be adversely affected The success of our product development efforts depends on our ability to anticipate market trends and the price, performance and functionality requirements of semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P14_S6	In order to anticipate these trends and ensure that critical development projects proceed in a coordinated manner, we must continue to collaborate closely with our largest customers.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P14_S7	Our relationships with these and other customers provide us with access to valuable information regarding trends in the semiconductor device industry, which enables us to better plan our product development activities.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P14_S8	If our current relationships with our large customers are impaired, or if we are unable to develop similar collaborative relationships with important customers in the future, our product development activities could be adversely affected.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P14_S9	Our ability to reduce costs is limited by our ongoing need to invest in research and development and to provide customer support activities Our industry is characterized by the need for continual investment in research and development as well as customer service and support.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P14_S10	As a result, our operating results could be materially affected if operating costs associated with our research and development as well as customer support activities increase in the future or we are unable to reduce those activities.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P14_S11	We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property and, therefore, lose our competitive advantage Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology for our principal product families, and we rely, in part, on patent and trade secret law and confidentiality agreements to protect that technology.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P14_S12	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it will give our competitors a significant advantage.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P14_S13	We own or have licensed a number of patents relating to our transparent and opaque thin film metrology, lithography and macro-defect inspection systems, and have filed applications for additional patents.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P14_S14	Any of our pending patent applications may be rejected, and we may be unable to develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable in the future.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P14_S15	In addition, the patents that we do own or that have been issued or licensed to us may not provide us with competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P14_S16	Further, third parties may also design around these patents.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In addition to patent protection, we rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and technology.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and other third parties.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Even though these agreements are in place there can be no assurances that trade secrets and proprietary information will not be disclosed, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, or that we can fully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Violations by others of our confidentiality agreements and the loss of employees who have specialized knowledge and expertise could harm our competitive position and cause our sales and operating results to decline as a result of increased competition.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Costly and time-consuming litigation might be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection might adversely affect our ability to continue our research or bring products to market.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Protection of our intellectual property rights, or the efforts of third parties to enforce their own intellectual property rights against us, may result in costly and time-consuming litigation, substantial damages, lost product sales and/or the loss of important intellectual property rights We may be required to initiate litigation in order to enforce any patents issued to or licensed by us, or to determine the scope or validity of a third party s patent or other proprietary rights.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Any litigation, regardless of outcome, could be expensive and time consuming, and could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to re-engineer our products or obtain expensive licenses from third parties.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	In addition, our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P16_S4	From time to time, we may receive communications from third parties asserting that our products or systems infringe, or may infringe, the proprietary rights of these third parties.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P16_S5	These claims of infringement may lead to protracted and costly litigation, which could require us to pay substantial damages or have the sale of our products or systems stopped by an injunction.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Infringement claims could also cause product or system delays or require us to redesign our products or systems, and these delays could result in the loss of substantial revenues.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P16_S7	We may also be required to obtain a license from the third party or cease activities utilizing the third party s proprietary rights.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P16_S8	We may not be able to enter into such a license or such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P16_S9	Accordingly, the loss of important intellectual property rights could hinder our ability to sell our systems, or make the sale of these systems more expensive.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P16_S10	For additional information regarding recent patent litigation, see Item 3.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in certain foreign countries, where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the United States The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement abroad.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	For example, Taiwan is not a signatory of the Patent Cooperation Treaty, which is designed to specify rules and methods for defending intellectual property internationally.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The publication of a patent in Taiwan prior to the filing of a patent in Taiwan would invalidate the ability of a company to obtain a patent in Taiwan.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Similarly, in contrast to the United States where the contents of patents remain confidential during the patent application process, in Taiwan the contents of a patent are published upon filing which provides competitors an advance view of the contents of a patent application prior to the establishment of patent rights.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Consequently, there is a risk that we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights in certain foreign countries.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P17_S5	If this occurs, it would be easier for our competitors to develop and sell competing products in these countries.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Some of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, and increased competition could impair sales of our products or cause us to reduce our prices The market for semiconductor capital equipment is highly competitive.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P17_S7	We face substantial competition from established companies in each of the markets we serve.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P17_S8	We principally compete with KLA-Tencor, Camtek and Ultratech.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P17_S9	We compete to a lesser extent with companies such as Nanometrics and Nikon.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P17_S10	Each of our products also competes with products that use different metrology, inspection or lithography techniques.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P17_S11	Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, broader product offerings and service capabilities and larger installed customer bases than we do.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P17_S12	As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or market developments by devoting greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products, which, in turn, could impair sales of our products.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P17_S13	Further, there may be significant merger and acquisition activity among our competitors and potential competitors, which, in turn, may provide them with a competitive advantage over us by enabling them to rapidly expand their product offerings and service capabilities to meet a broader range of customer needs.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Many of our customers and potential customers in the semiconductor device manufacturing industry are large companies that require global support and service for their semiconductor capital equipment.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We believe that our global support and service infrastructure is sufficient to meet the needs of our customers and potential customers.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	competing for the business of global semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Many of our competitors are investing heavily in the development of new systems that will compete directly with our systems.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We have from time to time selectively reduced prices on our systems in order to protect our market share, and competitive pressures may necessitate further price reductions.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	We expect our competitors in each product area to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices and performance characteristics.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P19_S4	These product introductions would likely require us to decrease the prices of our systems and increase the level of discounts that we grant our customers.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Price reductions or lost sales as a result of these competitive pressures would reduce our total revenues and could adversely impact our financial results.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We believe that once a semiconductor device manufacturer has selected one vendor s capital equipment for a production-line application, the manufacturer generally relies upon that capital equipment and, to the extent possible, subsequent generations of the same vendor s equipment, for the life of the application.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Once a vendor s equipment has been installed in a production line application, a semiconductor device manufacturer must often make substantial technical modifications and may experience production-line downtime in order to switch to another vendor s equipment.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Accordingly, unless our systems offer performance or cost advantages that outweigh a customer s expense of switching to our systems, it will be difficult for us to achieve significant sales to that manufacturer once it has selected another vendor s capital equipment for an application.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management, engineering, sales and marketing, customer support, finance and manufacturing personnel.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P20_S4	The loss of any of these key personnel, each of whom would be extremely difficult to replace, could harm our business and operating results.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Although we have employment and noncompetition agreements with key members of our senior management team, including Messrs. McLaughlin and Roth, these individuals or other key employees may still leave us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P20_S6	We do not have key person life insurance on any of our executives.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P20_S7	In addition, to support our future growth, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Competition for such personnel in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified employees.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P20_S9	We obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a limited group of suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenues We obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a limited group of suppliers and do not have long-term contracts with many of our suppliers.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P20_S10	Our dependence on limited source suppliers of components and our lack of long-term contracts with many of our suppliers exposes us to several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components, price increases, late deliveries and poor component quality.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P20_S11	Disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our systems, damage our customer relationships and reduce our sales.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	From time to time in the past, we have experienced temporary difficulties in receiving shipments from our suppliers.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The lead-time required for shipments of some of our components can be as long as four months.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, the lead time required to qualify new suppliers for lasers could be as long as a year, and the lead time required to qualify new suppliers of other components could be as long as nine months.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	If we are unable to accurately predict our component needs, or if our component supply is disrupted, we may miss market opportunities by not being able to meet the demand for our systems.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Further, a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components or subassemblies could seriously harm our results of operations and cash flows.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility could have a material adverse effect on our revenues Our manufacturing processes are highly complex and require sophisticated and costly equipment and a specially designed facility.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	As a result, any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, or destruction of or damage as a result of a fire or any other reason, could seriously harm our ability to satisfy our customer order deadlines.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If we cannot timely deliver our systems, our results from operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Our earnings could be negatively affected and our inventory levels could materially increase if we are unable to predict our inventory needs in an accurate and timely manner and adjust our orders for parts and subcomponents should our needs increase or decrease materially due to unexpected increases or decreases in demand for our products.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Any material increase in our inventories could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, while any material decrease in our ability to procure needed inventories could result in an inability to supply customer demand for our products, thus adversely affecting our revenues.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Our ability to fulfill our backlog may have an effect on our long term ability to procure contracts and fulfill current contracts Our ability to fulfill our backlog may be limited by our ability to devote sufficient financial and human capital resources and limited by available material supplies.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S6	If we do not fulfill our backlog in a timely manner, we may experience delays in product delivery which would postpone receipt of revenue from those delayed deliveries.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S7	Additionally, if we are consistently unable to fulfill our backlog, this may be a disincentive to customers to award large contracts to us in the future until they are comfortable that we can effectively manage our backlog.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S8	We may choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves, and may be unable to complete these acquisitions or may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired business in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner Our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S9	To this end, we have, from time to time, engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S10	We may choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products, technologies and/or services instead of developing them ourselves.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S11	We may, however, face competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established companies with greater financial resources, making it more difficult for us to complete acquisitions.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S12	We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from one or more acquisitions that we consummate.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S13	Integrating any business, product technology or service we acquire could be expensive and time-consuming and/or disrupt our ongoing business.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S14	Further, there are numerous risks associated therewith, including but not limited to:
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	unexpected reduction of sales of existing products by new products.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such favorable terms or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations, including as a result of our incurrence of indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In order to finance any acquisitions, we might need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In that event, we could be forced to obtain financing on terms that are not favorable to us and, in the case of equity financing, that result in dilution to our stockholders.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In addition, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, amortization of intangible assets, write-down of other assets or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions and purchase accounting could harm our business and operating results.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	If we cannot effectively manage growth, our business may suffer Over the long-term, we intend to seek to grow our business by increasing our sales efforts and completing strategic acquisitions.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	To effectively manage growth, we must, among other things:
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	administer appropriate financial and administrative control procedures.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Growth of our business will likely place a significant strain on our management, financial, operational, technical, sales and administrative resources.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Any failure to effectively manage our growth may cause our business to suffer and our stock price to decline.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Changes in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect results As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Our future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the (1) applicable tax laws; (2) composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates; or (3) valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P30_S3	In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P30_S4	We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Turmoil in the credit markets and the financial services industry may negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity During recent years, global credit markets and the financial services industry have experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by tightening of the credit markets, weakening of the global economy and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States and other governments.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Adverse economic conditions, such as sustained periods of economic uncertainty or a crisis in the financial markets may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition if our ability to obtain credit from trade creditors were to be impaired.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	In addition, a worsening economy or an economic crisis could also adversely impact our customers ability to finance the purchase of systems from us or our suppliers ability to provide us with product, either of which may negatively impact our business and results of operations.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations As a result of our sale of $60.0 million of 3.75% convertible senior notes on July 25, 2011 (the Notes ), we now have long-term debt.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our maintenance of indebtedness could have important consequences because:
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our ability to generate sufficient cash to pay our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash to pay our debt obligations, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of our debt obligations, seek to refinance all or a portion of our debt obligations or obtain additional financing.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P34_S3	There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Failure to make a payment on our debt obligations could also result in acceleration of all of our debt obligations, including the Notes, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P34_S5	We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or to repurchase the Notes Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture that governs the Notes), subject to certain conditions, holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P34_S6	In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, we will be required to make cash payments of up to $1,000 for each $1,000 in principal amount of Notes converted.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P34_S7	However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered for repurchase upon a fundamental change or to make cash payments in respect of Notes that are being converted.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P34_S8	In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P34_S9	Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P34_S10	A default under the indenture or a fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing any future indebtedness.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P34_S11	If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	New regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers On August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	These requirements will require companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	The first such report is required to be filed with the SEC by May 31, 2014.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P35_S3	The implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, including our products.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P35_S4	In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P35_S6	In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our operating results are subject to significant variation due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor device industry.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor device manufacturers, which, in turn, depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In recent years, the industry has experienced significant downturns, generally in connection with declines in economic conditions.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	This cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and, thus, future expense levels.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P38_S3	During a down cycle, we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P38_S4	In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P38_S5	We can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P38_S6	If we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business could be seriously harmed.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P38_S7	Our future rate of growth is highly dependent on the development and growth of the market for microelectronic device inspection, lithography and metrology equipment We target our products to address the needs of microelectronic device manufacturers for defect inspection, metrology and lithography.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P38_S8	If for any reason the market for microelectronic device inspection, lithography or metrology equipment fails to grow in the long term, we may be unable to maintain current revenue levels in the short term and maintain our historical growth in the long term.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Growth in the inspection market is dependent to a large extent upon microelectronic manufacturers replacing manual inspection with automated inspection technology.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Growth in the metrology market is dependent to a large extent upon new chip designs and capacity expansion of microelectronic manufacturers.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	There is no assurance that manufacturers will undertake these actions at the rate we expect.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Risks Related to our Stock Provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law, as well as our stockholder rights plan, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and/or delay, deter or prevent a change in control of our company Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as our stockholder rights plan, may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board of Directors.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P39_S4	These provisions also limit the circumstances in which a premium can be paid for the common stock, and in which a proxy contest for control of our board may be initiated.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	the authority of our board, without stockholder approval, to adopt a Stockholder Rights Plan.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Such a Shareholder Rights Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on June 27, 2005 .
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P40_S2	We are also entitled to avail ourselves of the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could inhibit changes in control of us.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our stock price is volatile The market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	From the beginning of fiscal year 2009 through the end of fiscal year 2013 , our stock price fluctuated between a high of $14.10 per share and a low of $1.95 per share.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Factors affecting our stock price may include:
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	the number of firms making a market in our common stock.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	In addition, the stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P42_S2	These fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high technology companies like ours.
1094392_14_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Any such market fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1094392_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our executive office building is located at One Rudolph Road in Flanders, New Jersey.
1094392_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own and lease facilities for engineering, manufacturing, sales and service related purposes in the United States and seven other countries China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Scotland.
1094392_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	The following table indicates the location, the general purpose and the square footage of our principal facilities.
1094392_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	The expiration years of the leases covering the leased facilities are also indicated.
1094392_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	We also lease office space for other smaller sales and service offices in several locations throughout the world.
1094392_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our existing facilities and capital equipment are adequate to meet our current requirements, and that suitable additional or substitute space is available on commercially reasonable terms if needed.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	As previously disclosed, in December 2007 , we completed the acquisition of specific assets and liabilities of the semiconductor division of Applied Precision LLC ( Applied ).
1094392_14_ITEM3_P1_S1	As a result of the acquisition, we assumed certain liabilities of Applied including a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court, District of Arizona, by Integrated Technology Corporation ( ITC ) which alleged Applied s PrecisionPoint , PrecisionWoRx and ProbeWoRx products infringed an ITC patent (Integrated Technology Corporation v. Rudolph Technologies, Inc., No. CV-06-2182-PHX-ROS).
1094392_14_ITEM3_P1_S2	Prior to trial, the District Court ruled that such products sold prior to August of 2007 (the pre-August 2007 tools ) infringed the ITC patent.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P1_S3	At trial in December of 2011 , a trial verdict was rendered in which the jury found that while our products manufactured after August of 2007 (the post- August 2007 tools ) did not literally infringe ITC s patent, the products were found to infringe under a rule known as the doctrine of equivalents, a legal principle which expands the language of patent claims to encompass products or processes which may otherwise be found not to literally infringe the patent.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P1_S4	The jury awarded $15.5 million to ITC in damages for sales made during the years 2000-2011 , of which award approximately one-half related to sales for pre- August 2007 tools.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P1_S5	August 2007 tools, the infringement was willful.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P1_S6	On July 23, 2012 , the District Court issued an Order which affirmed the jury s award, applied treble damages to the portion of the jury award related to post- August 2007 tool sales and granted ITC s motion for attorney s fees and prejudgment interest on the verdict and attorney s fees.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P1_S7	At that time, the District Court also enjoined us from future infringement of the ITC patent and from selling or supplying the applicable products with the applicable features from or into the United States.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P1_S8	We appealed the injunction, the District Court Order and the damages assessment.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P1_S9	In October 2012 , the injunction was stayed by the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals and thereafter in June of 2013 , the patent expired.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P1_S10	On November 4, 2013 , the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals issued a ruling which reversed the judgment of infringement against all post- August 2007 tools, reversed the finding of willfulness, vacated the treble damages award, vacated the award of attorney s fees and costs, remanded the issue back to the District Court for further review, and affirmed the award of damages and interest for the pre- August 2007 tools.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P1_S11	With regard to the damages assessment against the pre- August 2007 tools, we believe that we have meritorious defenses and shall continue to vigorously prosecute our appeal regarding this issue.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P1_S12	However, it is probable that we could realize a loss in this matter regarding the pre- August 2007 tools for which we have estimated and recorded a liability of approximately $4.3 million in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P1_S13	The maximum liability reasonably possible for the pre-August 2007 products, including damages and interest is an additional $6.3 million plus attorney s fees beyond the accrual.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P1_S14	While we continue to believe that our current PrecisionWoRx and ProbeWoRx systems do not infringe ITC s patent, we reached an agreement with ITC in October 2012 with regards to a redesign of the products under which ITC agreed that such redesign is permissible under the court s injunction.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P2_S0	In our patent infringement suit against Camtek, Ltd., of Migdal Hamek, Israel, concerning our proprietary continuous scan wafer inspection technology, the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals issued a ruling on August 22, 2011 .
1094392_14_ITEM3_P2_S1	In its opinion, the Appellate Court affirmed multiple rulings from trial at the District Court level including (i) finding our U.S.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P2_S2	Patent No. 6,826,298 valid, (ii) the part of the infringement ruling based on the finding that Camtek s Falcon product strobes based on velocity, and (iii) the dismissal of Camtek s claim against us for inequitable conduct against the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P2_S3	The court did, however, revise one claim construction ruling made by the District Court in the original case.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P2_S4	As a result, the Appellate Court set aside the verdict delivered by the jury for damages and the District Court s decision to enter an injunction against Camtek s selling Falcon tools in the U.S. and remanded the case back to the trial court for a limited trial on this single infringement issue.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P2_S5	No trial date has been set for this limited trial.
1094392_14_ITEM3_P3_S0	This lawsuit was initially brought in 2005 by August Technology prior to its merger with us.

1094392_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	As of February 5, 2014 , there were 81 stockholders of record of our common stock and approximately 6,652 beneficial stockholders.
1094392_14_ITEM5_P4_S1	The closing market value of our common stock on February 5, 2014 was $10.98 per share.
1094392_14_ITEM5_P4_S2	We have never declared or paid a cash dividend on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1094392_14_ITEM5_P4_S3	We currently intend to retain our earnings, if any, for the development of our business.

1094392_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1094392_14_ITEM6_P1_S1	The balance sheet data as of December 31, 2012 and 2013 and the statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2012 and 2013 set forth below were derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1094392_14_ITEM6_P1_S2	The balance sheet data as of 2009 , 2010 and 2011 , and the statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010 were derived from our audited consolidated financial statements not included herein.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview We are a worldwide leader in the design, development, manufacture and support of defect inspection, advanced packaging lithography, process control metrology, and data analysis systems and software used by microelectronic device manufacturers.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	We provide process and yield management solutions used in both wafer processing and final manufacturing through a family of standalone systems for macro-defect inspection, lithography, probe card test and analysis, and transparent and opaque thin film measurements.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	All Rudolph systems feature sophisticated software and production-worthy automation.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	Rudolph systems are backed by worldwide customer support.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	In June 2012 , we announced that we had acquired specific assets and liabilities of NanoPhotonics GmbH, located in Mainz, Germany ( NanoPhotonics acquisition ).
1094392_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	The acquired business has been integrated into our inspection technology group.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	The impact of the acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	In December 2012 , we announced that we had acquired Azores Corporation, located in Wilmington, Massachusetts ( Azores acquisition ).
1094392_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	The acquired business marks our entry into the advanced packaging and flat panel display lithography markets and forms our lithography systems group.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	The impact of the acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	In April 2013 , we announced that we had acquired specific assets of Tamar Technology, located in Newbury Park, California ( Tamar acquisition ).
1094392_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	The acquired business has been integrated into our inspection technology group.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	The impact of the acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	We recognized provisional assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date for NanoPhotonics, Azores and Tamar.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	For the period ended December 31, 2013 , we finalized the identification and measurement of the assets and liabilities for all of these acquisitions.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	We recast our December 31, 2012 balance sheet to reflect measurement period adjustments related to Azores inventory, income taxes and goodwill.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Rudolph s business is affected by the annual spending patterns of our customers on semiconductor capital equipment.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	The amount that our customers devote to capital equipment spending depends on a number of factors, including general worldwide economic conditions as well as other economic drivers such as personal computer, tablet, cell phone, other personal electronic devices and automotive sales.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	Current forecasts by industry analysts for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry project a year-over-year increase in capital spending of approximately 10% to 15% for 2014.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our revenues and profitability, tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	We monitor capital equipment spending through announced capital spending plans by our customers and monthly-published industry data such as the book-to-bill ratio.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	The book-to-bill ratio is a 3-month running statistic that compares bookings or orders placed with capital equipment suppliers to billings or shipments.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	A book-to-bill ratio above 1.0 shows that semiconductor device equipment manufacturers are ordering equipment at a pace that exceeds the equipment suppliers shipments for the period.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P6_S4	The three month rolling average North American semiconductor equipment book-to-bill ratio was 1.02 for the month of December 2013 , increasing from the September 2013 book-to-bill ratio of 0.97 .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Historically, a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers, and we expect this trend to continue.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2012 and 2013 , sales to customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for 43.6% , 50.9% , and 41.6% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	We do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products, and they could cease purchasing products from us at any time.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	A delay in purchase or cancellation by any of our large customers could cause quarterly revenues to vary significantly.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	In addition, during a given quarter, a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	A significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customers outside of the United States.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	We expect that revenues generated from customers outside of the United States will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	The following table lists, for the periods indicated, the revenue derived from customers outside of the United States (in percentages of total revenues):
1094392_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	The sales cycle for our systems typically ranges from six to 15 months, and can be longer when our customers are evaluating new technology.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Due to the length of these cycles, we invest significantly in research and development and sales and marketing in advance of generating revenues related to these investments.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our statements of operations data as percentages of our revenues.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	Our results of operations are reported as one business segment.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Results of Operations 2011 , 2012 and 2013 Revenues.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	Our revenues are derived from the sale of our systems, services, spare parts and software licensing.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	Our revenues were $187.2 million , $218.5 million and $176.2 million for the years ended 2011 , 2012 and 2013 , respectively.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	This represents an increase of 16.7% from 2011 to 2012 and a decrease of 19.3% from 2012 to 2013 .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P12_S4	The increase in revenue from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to increased capital spending by our back-end customers in the semiconductor industry.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P12_S5	The decrease in revenue from, 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to a slowdown in capital equipment purchases by our customers in the semiconductor manufacturing industry.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P12_S6	The following table lists, for the periods indicated, the different sources of our revenues in dollars (thousands) and as percentages of our total revenues:
1094392_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Total systems and software revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 due to an increase in demand for our products in advanced packaging.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	The year-over-year decreases in metrology systems revenue of $0.6 million and data analysis and review software revenues of $3.5 million from 2011 to 2012 were primarily due to decreased sales across all metrology and data analysis and review software product families.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	The average selling price of similarly configured systems has been consistent and therefore did not have a material impact on our revenue for the same period.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	Systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to 55% of total revenue for 2011 compared to 67% of total revenue for 2012 .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P14_S3	The year-over-year decrease in parts and service revenues in absolute dollars from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to decreased spending by our customers on repairs of existing systems as they purchased new systems.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P14_S4	Parts and services revenues are generated from part sales, maintenance service contracts, system upgrades, as well as time and material billable service calls.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P14_S5	Total systems and software revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 due to a decrease in demand for our products in advanced packaging and front-end systems.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P14_S6	This contributed to a decrease in the number of inspection systems sold year-over-year and reflected a decrease in inspection systems revenue of $39.8 million .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P14_S7	The year-over-year decreases in metrology systems revenue of $11.5 million and data analysis and review software revenues of $1.9 million from 2012 to 2013 were primarily due to decreased sales across all metrology product families and decrease licensing revenue from the data analysis and review software product category.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P14_S8	The year-over-year increase in lithography systems revenue from 2012 to 2013 of $8.5 million was due to our entrance into the lithography market.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P14_S9	The average selling price of similarly configured systems has been consistent and therefore did not have a material impact on our revenue for the same period.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P14_S10	Systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to 67% of total revenue for 2012 compared to 64% of total revenue for 2013 .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P14_S11	The year-over-year increase in parts and service revenues in absolute dollars from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to increased spending by our customers on repairs of existing systems.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P14_S12	Parts and services revenues are generated from part sales, maintenance service contracts, system upgrades, as well as time and material billable service calls.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P14_S13	Deferred revenues of $8.8 million were recorded in Other current liabilities at December 31, 2013 and primarily consisted of $6.6 million for deferred maintenance agreements and $2.2 million for systems awaiting acceptance and outstanding deliverables.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P14_S14	Our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including manufacturing efficiencies, excess and obsolete inventory write-offs, pricing by competitors or suppliers, new product introductions, production volume, customization and reconfiguration of systems, international and domestic sales mix, and parts and service margins.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P14_S15	Our gross profit was $100.4 million , $115.7 million and $90.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2012 and 2013 , respectively.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P14_S16	The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to product mix, which included a decrease in software sales.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P14_S17	The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to lower volume of system and software sales as well as product mix.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	We do not track gross margin by the sources of revenue.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	The macro-defect inspection, thin film transparent, opaque process control, and probe card test analysis market is characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	We believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements of existing products, including the transition to copper and low-k dielectrics, wafer level packaging, the continuous shrinkage in critical dimensions, and the evolution of ultra-thin gate process control, is critical to our success.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our technical, management and financial resources to research and development programs.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P16_S3	Research and development expenditures consist primarily of salaries and related expenses of employees engaged in research, design and development activities.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P16_S4	They also include consulting fees, the cost of related supplies and legal costs to defend our patents.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P16_S5	Our research and development expense was $36.3 million , $39.3 million and $40.0 million in 2011 , 2012 and 2013 , respectively.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P16_S6	The year-over-year dollar increase from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to higher compensation and project costs, as well as, additional research and development costs for acquired businesses in 2012 .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	and development costs for acquired businesses in the latter part of 2012 and in 2013 .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	We continue to maintain our commitment to investing in new product development and enhancement to existing products.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs for sales, marketing, and general administrative personnel, as well as commissions and other non-personnel related expenses.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	Our selling, general and administrative expense was $40.8 million , $40.2 million and $41.5 million in 2011 , 2012 and 2013 , respectively.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	The year-over-year decrease from 2011 to 2012 in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily due to decreased corporate legal expenses, partially offset by increased compensation costs.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	The year-over-year increase from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to the inclusion of selling, general and administrative expenses for acquired businesses in the latter part of 2012 and in 2013 .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P18_S4	In 2011 , 2012 and 2013 , net interest expense was $1.9 million , $4.4 million and $5.1 million , respectively.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P18_S5	The year-over-year increase in net interest expense for 2012 was primarily due to a full year of interest expense related to the convertible senior notes.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P18_S6	The year-over-year increase in net interest expense for 2013 was primarily due to increased amortization of the interest discount related to the convertible senior notes.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P18_S7	The following table provides details of income tax (dollars in millions):
1094392_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	The income tax benefit differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 35% in 2011 and 2012, primarily as a result of reversal of valuation allowances, partially offset by taxes accrued in foreign jurisdictions.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	The income tax benefit differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 35% for 2013, primarily from research and development tax credits which were not available in 2012 as a result of legislation, foreign tax credits, and the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits, offset by $1.3 million of expense related to a correction of prior year income tax balances recognized in the fourth quarter of 2013.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P19_S2	The correction of the prior year income tax balance was not considered material to the prior year or current year financial statements.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	We evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets from future taxable income and establish valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	We consider available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	At December 31, 2012 and 2013 , we had valuation allowances of $1.4 million and $1.6 million on certain of our deferred tax assets to reflect the deferred tax asset at the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P20_S3	We evaluated the realizability of the deferred tax asset based on positive earnings from 2011 through 2013 as well as the projected earnings in future years and believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized in the future years.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P20_S4	We will continue to monitor the realizability of the deferred tax asset and evaluate the valuation allowance.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was passed by Congress and signed into law in January.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	The provisions under this law were made retroactive to January 1, 2012.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	However, as a result of the law being signed in January 2013, the financial impact of any retroactive provision was recorded as a discrete event in the first quarter of 2013.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P21_S3	This discrete event reduced tax expense in the first quarter of 2013 by approximately $0.8 million for research and development tax credits for 2012.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	As discussed in Part I, Item 3.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	Legal Proceedings , we are subject to legal proceedings and claims, which include, among other things, our on-going litigation with ITC in a patent infringement action related to the predictive scrub feature of our PrecisionPoint , PrecisionWoRx and ProbeWoRx products in which we were the defendants.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	See Part I, Item 3 for a discussion of this action and the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals ruling reversing the finding of infringement against products sold after August of 2007 and its order of other relief in this matter.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	The U.S. Federal Court of Appeals did affirm the jury s finding of damages against us related to products sold prior to August of 2007 for which we are in the process of pursuing an appeal.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P22_S4	In the event that the ultimate decision in the ITC Litigation results in a judgment of damages against us at the high end of the identified ranges, such result will have a material impact on the our results of operations and may also have a material impact on our liquidity and financial condition.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2012 , our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $169.2 million , while working capital amounted to $251.5 million .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	At December 31, 2013 , we had $167.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $256.5 million in working capital.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Typically during periods of revenue growth, changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a use of cash as we incur costs and expend cash in advance of receiving cash from our customers.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	Similarly, during periods of declining revenue, changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a source of cash as inventory purchases decline and revenue from prior periods is collected.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	Net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2012 and 2013 totaled $45.4 million , $22.1 million and $6.1 million , respectively.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2011 , cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, of $28.9 million , and a decrease in accounts receivable of $18.0 million , and an increase in other liabilities of $8.3 million , partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $4.4 million , a decrease in accounts payable of $3.4 million , a decrease in deferred revenue of $1.3 million , and an increase in income taxes of $0.5 million .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P24_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2012 , cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, of $39.4 million , and an increase in deferred revenue of $3.6 million , a decrease in income taxes of $3.5 million , and an increase in other liabilities of $1.0 million , partially offset by an increase accounts receivable of $14.7 million , an increase in inventory of $6.7 million and an decrease in accounts payable of $2.7 million , and an increase in prepaid and other assets of $1.4 million .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P24_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, of $19.8 million , a decrease in account receivable of $2.6 million , and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.4 million , partially offset by an increase in inventory of $6.8 million , a decrease in other liabilities of $3.0 million , an increase in income taxes of $4.6 million , a decrease in deferred revenue of $2.4 million , and a decrease in accounts payable of $0.9 million .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P24_S6	Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2012 and 2013 totaled $71.2 million , $14.9 million and $30.0 million , respectively.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P24_S7	During the year ended December 31, 2011 , net cash used by investing activities included purchases of marketable securities of $81.0 million and capital expenditures of $1.6 million , which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $11.4 million .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P24_S8	During the year ended December 31, 2012 , net cash used by investing activities included purchases of marketable securities of $96.3 million , acquisition costs for business combinations of $18.6 million , and capital expenditures of $2.4 million , which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $102.4 million .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P24_S9	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , net cash used by investing activities included purchases of marketable securities of $119.1 million , capital expenditures of $4.9 million , and acquisition costs for business combinations of $3.4 million , which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $97.3 million .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P24_S10	Capital expenditures over the next twelve months are expected to be approximately $5.0 million to $6.0 million .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P24_S11	Net cash provided by financing activities was $51.0 million , $0.5 million and $1.4 million in 2011 , 2012 and 2013 , respectively.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	In the 2012 and 2013 periods, net cash provided by financing activities comprised proceeds received from sales of shares through share-based compensation plans and tax benefit from share-based compensation plans.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	From time to time we evaluate whether to acquire new or complementary businesses, products and/or technologies.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	We may fund all or a portion of the purchase price of these acquisitions in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	In July 2008 , our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to 3 million shares of Company common stock with no established end date.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	As of the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not purchased any shares under this program.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	On July 25, 2011 , we issued $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% convertible senior notes, which mature on July 15, 2016 and pay interest semiannually commencing on January 15, 2012 .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P27_S3	In connection with the issuance, we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P27_S4	The convertible note hedge transaction is intended to reduce potential dilution in our common stock upon conversion of the notes.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P27_S5	However, the warrant transaction will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrant.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P27_S6	Net proceeds realized from the sale of the convertible senior notes, the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions were $50.2 million .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P27_S7	We continue to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include financing potential acquisitions and strategic transactions, growth initiatives and working capital.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P27_S8	For additional information, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and amount of our revenues and our investment decisions, which will affect our ability to generate additional cash.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P27_S9	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs for the next twelve months.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P27_S10	Thereafter, if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements, we may seek additional funding through bank borrowings, sales of securities or other means.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P27_S11	There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us or at all.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2013 , and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	This table excludes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits that totaled approximately $5.7 million at December 31, 2013 .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	We are currently unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount or periods when cash settlement of this liability may occur.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company does not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity and capital resources.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Critical Accounting Policies Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	We review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P30_S3	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, business acquisitions, intangible assets, share-based payments, income taxes and warranty obligations.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P30_S4	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P30_S5	Results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P30_S6	These estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis, and by the Audit Committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P30_S7	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Revenue is recognized provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	Revenue recognition generally results at the following points: (1) for all transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment for all products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment; the portion of revenue associated with certain installation-related tasks is deferred, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation-related tasks; (2) for products that have not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized at customer technical acceptance; (3) for transactions which have occurred prior to January 1, 2011, revenue for arrangements with multiple elements, such as sales of products that include software and services, was allocated to each element using the residual method based on the fair value of the undelivered items as determined using the prior guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	Under the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements; (4) for transactions occurring on or after January 1, 2011 containing multiple elements, the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred using the relative selling price method utilizing vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) or estimated sales prices ( ESP ) until delivery of the deferred elements.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P31_S3	Third-party evidence is not typically used to determine selling prices as to limited availability of reliable competitor products selling prices.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	The ESP is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, gross margin objectives, internal costs and competitor pricing strategies.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	Revenues from parts sales are recognized at the time of shipment.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	Revenue from training and service contracts is recognized ratably over the training period and contract period.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	A provision for the estimated cost of fulfilling warranty obligations is recorded at the time the related revenue is recognized.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P33_S3	Revenue from software license fees is recognized upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and VSOE exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P33_S4	License support and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	We specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if our assumptions are otherwise incorrect, additional allowances may be required.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P34_S3	We maintain reserves for our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product life-cycles, product demand and market conditions.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P34_S4	If actual product life-cycles, product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those originally projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	We account for acquired or merged businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition or merger at their respective fair values.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	Accordingly, for significant acquisitions, we typically obtain assistance from independent valuation specialists.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	There are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	For intangible assets, we typically utilize the income method.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the projected future cash flows (including timing) and the discount rate reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flows.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	For example, different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	All of these judgments and estimates can significantly impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P39_S3	Our formal annual impairment testing date for goodwill is October 31 st or prior to the next annual testing date if an event occurs or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	Under the amendments of ASC 350-10, ASU No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, beginning in the first quarter of 2012, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	If, we elect this option and after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	We have not elected this option to date.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process which requires us to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	The first step consists of estimating the fair value of our aggregated reporting unit using the market value of our common stock at October 31 st , multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares (market capitalization) and an implied control premium as if it were to be acquired by a single stockholder.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	We obtain information on completed sales of similar companies in a comparable industry to estimate an implied control premium for us.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	We compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value which includes goodwill.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	If the results of the initial market capitalization test produce results which are below the reporting unit carrying value, we will also consider if the market capitalization is temporarily low and, if so, we may also perform a discounted cash flow test.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the second step is completed to compute the impairment amount by determining the implied fair value of goodwill.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	This determination requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	Any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill which is compared to the corresponding carrying value to compute the goodwill impairment amount.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	Long-Lived Assets and Acquired Intangible Assets.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	We periodically review long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and the impairment of such long-lived assets, if any, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	No such indicators were noted in 2013 .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	The fair value of our stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	The Black-Scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility, expected terms, risk-free rates and dividend yield.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	We use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	The expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options, and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	We have never paid cash dividends, and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends, and thus have assumed a 0% dividend yield.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	If our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share-based compensation cost, or if different assumptions had been used, we may have recorded too much or too little share-based compensation cost.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	for those shares expected to vest.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	If the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	While we engage in product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P53_S3	Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	The need for a valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred taxes will be recoverable.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, we may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P54_S2	At December 31, 2012 and 2013 , we had valuation allowances of $1.4 million and $1.6 million on certain of our deferred tax assets to reflect the deferred tax asset at the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P54_S3	We evaluated the realizability of the deferred tax asset based on positive earnings from 2011 and 2013 as well as the projected earnings in future years and believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized in the future years.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P54_S4	We will continue to monitor the realizability of the deferred tax asset and evaluate the valuation allowance.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	The first step requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that the tax position has met the threshold for recognition; therefore, we must evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P55_S2	The second step requires us to measure the tax benefit of the tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized when effectively settled.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P55_S3	This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P55_S4	We reevaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues, and new audit activity.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P55_S5	Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P55_S6	Although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P55_S7	If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, it could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2013 , the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2013-11, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	The ASU requires that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except as follows.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P56_S2	To the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P56_S3	The assessment of whether a deferred tax asset is available is based on the unrecognized tax benefit and deferred tax asset that exist at the reporting date and should be made presuming disallowance of the tax position at the reporting date.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013 .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	The adoption of this guidance is reflected in our consolidated statements of financial position and cash flows.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	In July 2013 , the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-10, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate (or Overnight Index Swap Rate) as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	The ASU permits the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate (OIS) to be used as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 850, in addition to UST and LIBOR.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	The amendments also remove the restriction on using different benchmark rates for similar hedges.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P58_S3	This ASU is effective prospectively for qualifying new or redesignated hedging relationships entered into on or after July 17, 2013 .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P58_S4	We do not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	In February 2013 , the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	The ASU requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in its entirety to net income.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	For other amounts that are not required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period, an entity is required to cross-reference other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts.
1094392_14_ITEM7_P59_S3	This ASU is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012 .
1094392_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	The adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1094392_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate and Credit Market Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates and market liquidity including our investments in certain available-for-sale securities and our convertible senior notes.
1094392_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our available-for-sale securities consist of fixed and variable rate income investments (Municipal notes, bonds and an auction rate security).
1094392_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates, market liquidity and credit ratings of issuers from our available-for-sale securities.
1094392_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	It is possible that we are at risk if interest rates, market liquidity or credit ratings of issuers change in an unfavorable direction.
1094392_14_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The magnitude of any gain or loss will be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.
1094392_14_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our financial investments held as of December 31, 2013 , an immediate adverse change of 10% in interest rates (e.g. 3.00% to 3.30%) would result in an immaterial decrease in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities.
1094392_14_ITEM7A_P0_S6	The interest rate on our convertible senior notes is fixed.
1094392_14_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Therefore, any change in interest rates will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1094392_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Foreign Currency Risk We have branch operations in Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea and wholly-owned subsidiaries in Europe, Japan and China.
1094392_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our international subsidiaries and branches operate primarily using local functional currencies.
1094392_14_ITEM7A_P1_S2	These foreign branches and subsidiaries are limited in their operations and level of investment so that the risk of currency fluctuations is not material.
1094392_14_ITEM7A_P1_S3	A hypothetical 10% appreciation or depreciation in the U.S. dollar relative to the reporting currencies of our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 would have affected the foreign-currency-denominated non-operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries by approximately $2.2 million .
1094392_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1094392_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	A substantial portion of our international systems sales are denominated in U.S. dollars with the exception of Japan and, as a result, we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these sales.
1094392_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Substantially all our sales in Japan are denominated in Japanese yen.
1094392_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	From time to time, we may enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within 12 months.
1094392_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The change in fair value of the forward contracts is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations each reporting period.
1094392_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The total notional contract value of these outstanding forward contracts at December 31, 2012 and 2013 was $3.5 million and $1.0 million , respectively.
1094392_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1094392_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	The consolidated financial statements required by this item are set forth on the pages indicated at Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1094392_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in SEC rules and forms.
1094392_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	These controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1094392_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, we have recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1094392_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management is required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures.
1094392_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	We performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, to assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2013 .
1094392_14_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Based on that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2013 at the reasonable assurance level.
1094392_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
1094392_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1094392_14_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) ( COSO ).
1094392_14_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013 .
1094392_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1094392_14_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1094392_14_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 have been audited by Ernst Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1094392_14_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Ernst Young LLP has also audited our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , as stated in its attestation report included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1094392_14_ITEM9A_P6_S0	There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company s quarter ended December 31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

1094392_14_ITEM15_P9_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P10_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P10_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P10_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P10_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Rudolph Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and 2013, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

1094392_14_ITEM15_P11_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P12_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

1094392_14_ITEM15_P12_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P12_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1094392_14_ITEM15_P17_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P18_S0	Organization and Nature of Operations: Rudolph Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company ) designs, develops, manufactures and supports high-performance process control defect inspection, advanced packaging lithography, metrology and process control software systems used in semiconductor device manufacturing.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P18_S1	The Company has branch sales and service offices in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore and wholly-owned sales and service subsidiaries in the United States, Europe, Japan and China.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P18_S2	The Company operates in a single segment and is a provider of process characterization equipment and software for wafer fabs and advanced packaging facilities.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P19_S0	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: A. Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P19_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P19_S2	Revenue is recognized provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P19_S3	Revenue recognition generally results at the following points: (1) for all transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment for all products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment; the portion of revenue associated with certain installation-related tasks is deferred, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation-related tasks; (2) for products that have not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized at customer technical acceptance; (3) for transactions which have occurred prior to January 1, 2011, revenue for arrangements with multiple elements, such as sales of products that include software and services, was allocated to each element using the residual method based on the fair value of the undelivered items as determined using the prior guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P19_S4	Under the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements; (4) for transactions occurring on or after January 1, 2011 containing multiple elements, the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred using the relative selling price method utilizing vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) or estimated sales prices ( ESP ) until delivery of the deferred elements.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P19_S5	Third-party evidence is not typically used to determine selling prices as to limited availability of reliable competitor products selling prices.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P20_S0	The ESP is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, gross margin objectives, internal costs and competitor pricing strategies.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P21_S0	Revenues from parts sales are recognized at the time of shipment.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P21_S1	Revenue from training and service contracts is recognized ratably over the training period and contract period.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P21_S2	A provision for the estimated cost of fulfilling warranty obligations is recorded at the time the related revenue is recognized.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P21_S3	Revenue from software license fees is recognized upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and VSOE exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P21_S4	License support and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P22_S0	C. Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

1094392_14_ITEM15_P23_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P24_S0	D. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include cash and highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P24_S1	E. Marketable Securities: The Company determined that all of its investment securities are to be classified as available-for-sale.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P24_S2	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity under the caption Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P24_S3	Realized gains and losses, interest and dividends on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income and other, net.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	Available-for-sale securities are classified as current assets regardless of their maturity date if they are available for use in current operations.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P26_S0	The Company reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P26_S1	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, credit quality and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P26_S2	When a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities are charged against earnings.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P27_S0	The specific identification method is used to determine the gains and losses on marketable securities.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P27_S1	For additional information on the Company s marketable securities, see Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P28_S0	F. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P28_S1	In the cases where the Company is aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligation, the Company records a specific allowance against amounts due, and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount management reasonably believes will be collected.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P28_S2	For all other customers, the Company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are outstanding, industry and geographic concentrations, the current business environment and historical experience.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P29_S0	G. Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P29_S1	Cost includes material, labor and overhead costs.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P29_S2	Demonstration units, which are available for sale, are stated at their manufacturing costs and reserves are recorded to adjust the demonstration units to their net realizable value, if lower than cost.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P30_S0	H. Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P30_S1	Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which are thirty years for buildings, four to seven years for machinery and equipment, seven years for furniture and fixtures, and three years for computer equipment.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P30_S2	Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related asset.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P30_S3	Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and major renewals and betterments are capitalized.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P31_S0	I. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and identifiable acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P32_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P32_S1	If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is generally based on discounted cash flows.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P33_S0	J. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Intangible assets with definitive useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P33_S1	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually and when there are indications of impairment.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P34_S0	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P34_S1	Under the amendments of ASC 350-10, ASU No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, beginning in the first quarter of 2012, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P34_S2	If, the Company elects this option and after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P34_S3	The Company has not elected this option to date.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P35_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its aggregated reporting unit using the market value of its common stock at October 31 multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares (market capitalization) and an implied control premium as it were to be acquired by a single stockholder.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P35_S1	The Company obtains information on completed sales of similar companies in the related industry to estimate the implied control premium for the Company.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P36_S0	If the results of the initial market capitalization test produce results which are below the reporting unit carrying value, the Company may also perform a discounted cash flow test.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P37_S0	The Company tested for goodwill impairment on October 31, 2013 .
1094392_14_ITEM15_P37_S1	For additional information on the Company s goodwill and purchased intangible assets, see Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P38_S0	K. Concentration of Credit Risk: Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.

1094392_14_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P40_S0	M. Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach for deferred taxes which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company s consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P41_S0	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce a deferred tax asset to that portion which more likely than not will be realized.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P42_S0	for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign operations as it is the Company s intention to permanently re-invest undistributed earnings.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P42_S1	The impact of an uncertain income tax position is recognized as the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority and includes consideration of interest and penalties.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P42_S2	An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P42_S3	The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified as non-current unless the liability is expected to be settled in cash within 12 months of the reporting date.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P42_S4	For additional information on the Company s income taxes, see Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P43_S0	N. Translation of Foreign Currencies: The Company has branch operations in Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea and wholly-owned subsidiaries in Europe, Japan and China.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P43_S1	Its international subsidiaries and branches operate primarily using local functional currencies.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P43_S2	These foreign branches and subsidiaries are limited in their operations and level of investment so that the risk of currency fluctuations is not material.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P43_S3	A substantial portion of the Company s international systems sales are denominated in U.S. dollars with the exception of Japan and, as a result, it has relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these sales.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P43_S4	Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and income and expense accounts and cash flow items are translated at average monthly exchange rates during the period.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P43_S5	Net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements and the effect of exchange rates on intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature are recorded directly as a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption, Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P43_S6	Any foreign currency gains or losses related to transactions are included in operating results.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P43_S7	The Company had accumulated exchange losses resulting from the translation of foreign operation financial statements of $985 and $1,645 as of December 31, 2012 and 2013 , respectively.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P44_S0	The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P44_S1	The Black-Scholes valuation calculation requires the Company to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility, expected terms, risk-free interest rates and dividend yield.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P45_S0	Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company s stock.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P45_S1	The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P45_S2	The expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options, and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P45_S3	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P45_S4	The Company has never paid cash dividends, and does not currently intend to pay cash dividends, and thus has assumed a 0% dividend yield.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P46_S0	The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires significant judgment.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P46_S1	The Company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P46_S2	Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from the Company s current estimates.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	Compensation expense for all share-based payments includes an estimate for forfeitures and is recognized over the expected term of the share-based awards using the straight-line method.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P47_S1	For additional information on the Company s share-based compensation plans, see Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P48_S0	P. Research and Development and Software Development Costs: Expenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P49_S0	Certain software product development costs incurred after technological feasibility has been established are capitalized and amortized, commencing upon the general release of the software product to the Company s customers, over the economic life of the software product.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P50_S0	Annual amortization of capitalized costs is computed using the greater of: (i) the ratio of current gross revenues for the software product over the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for the software product or (ii) the straight-line basis, typically over seven years.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P50_S1	Software product development costs incurred prior to the product reaching technological feasibility are expensed as incurred and included in research and development costs.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P50_S2	At December 31, 2012 and 2013 , capitalized software development costs were $201 and $16 , respectively.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P50_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2012 and 2013 , software development cost amortization totaled $356 , $361 and $185 , respectively.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	Shipping and handling cost are included as a component of cost of revenues.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	R. Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P52_S1	The carrying amount of our convertible senior notes was $49,010 and $51,751 as of December 31, 2012 and 2013 , respectively.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P52_S2	The fair value of our convertible senior notes was $51,018 and $59,340 as of December 31, 2012 and 2013 , respectively.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P52_S3	The Company s convertible senior notes are not publicly traded.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P53_S0	The estimated fair value of these obligations is based, primarily, on a market approach, comparing the Company s interest rates to those rates the Company believes it would reasonably receive upon re-entry into the market.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P53_S1	Judgment is required to estimate the fair value, using available market information and appropriate valuation methods.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P53_S2	For additional information on the Company s fair value of financial instruments, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P54_S0	S. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities: The Company, when it considers it to be appropriate, enters into forward contracts to hedge the economic exposures arising from foreign currency denominated transactions.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P54_S1	At December 31, 2012 and 2013 , these contracts included the future sale of Japanese Yen to purchase U.S. dollars.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P54_S2	The foreign currency forward contracts were entered into by the Company s Japanese subsidiary to hedge a portion of certain intercompany obligations.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P54_S3	The forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and therefore, the change in fair value is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P54_S4	The Company records its forward contracts at fair value in either prepaid expenses and other current assets or other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P54_S5	The dollar equivalent of the U.S. dollar forward contracts and related fair values as of December 31, 2012 and 2013 were as follows:

1094392_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2013 financial statement presentation.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	In July 2013 , the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2013-11, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P57_S1	The ASU requires that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except as follows.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P57_S2	To the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P57_S3	The assessment of whether a deferred tax asset is available is based on the unrecognized tax benefit and deferred tax asset that exist at the reporting date and should be made presuming disallowance of the tax position at the reporting date.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P57_S4	This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013 .
1094392_14_ITEM15_P57_S5	The adoption of this guidance is reflected in the Company s consolidated statements of financial position and cash flows.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	In July 2013 , the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-10, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate (or Overnight Index Swap Rate) as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P58_S1	The ASU permits the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate (OIS) to be used as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 850, in addition to UST and LIBOR.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P58_S2	The amendments also remove the restriction on using different benchmark rates for similar hedges.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P58_S3	This ASU is effective prospectively for qualifying new or redesignated hedging relationships entered into on or after July 17, 2013 .
1094392_14_ITEM15_P58_S4	The Company does not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P59_S0	In February 2013 , the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P59_S1	The ASU requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in its entirety to net income.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P59_S2	For other amounts that are not required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period, an entity is required to cross-reference other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P59_S3	This ASU is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012 .
1094392_14_ITEM15_P60_S0	The adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P61_S0	Business Combinations: NanoPhotonics In June 2012, the Company announced that it had acquired specific assets and liabilities of NanoPhotonics GmbH, located in Mainz, Germany ( NanoPhotonics acquisition ).
1094392_14_ITEM15_P61_S1	The acquired business has been integrated into the Company s inspection technology group.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	The impact of the acquisition was not material to the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P63_S0	In December 2012, the Company announced that it had acquired Azores Corporation, located in Wilmington, Massachusetts ( Azores acquisition ).
1094392_14_ITEM15_P63_S1	The acquired business marks the Company s entry into the advanced packaging and FPD lithography markets.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	The impact of the acquisition was not material to the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	In April 2013 , the Company announced that it had acquired specific assets of Tamar Technology, located in Newbury Park, California ( Tamar acquisition ).

1094392_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	The impact of the acquisition was not material to the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P66_S1	The Company recognized provisional assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date for NanoPhotonics, Azores and Tamar.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P66_S2	For the period ended December 31, 2013 , the Company finalized the identification and measurement of the assets and liabilities for all of these acquisitions.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P66_S3	The Company recast its December 31, 2012 balance sheet to reflect measurement period adjustments related to Azores inventory, income taxes and goodwill.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P67_S0	Fair Value Measurements: The Company applies a three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurements.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P67_S1	This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P68_S1	Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P68_S2	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management s assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P69_S0	A financial asset s or liability s fair value measurement classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	The following tables provide the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 :
1094392_14_ITEM15_P71_S0	The Company s investments classified as Level 1 are based on quoted prices that are available in active markets.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P71_S1	The Company s investments classified as Level 2 are valued using observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	The foreign currency forward contracts are primarily measured based on the foreign currency spot and forward rates quoted by the banks or foreign currency dealers.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P73_S0	Investment prices are obtained from third party pricing providers, which models prices utilizing the above observable inputs, for each asset class.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P74_S0	Level 3 investments consist of an auction rate security and contingent consideration related to an acquisition for which the Company uses a discounted cash flow model to value these investments.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P74_S1	The Level 3 assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model included estimates of interest rates of 3.7% , timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the auction rate security, based on data available as of December 31, 2013 .
1094392_14_ITEM15_P74_S2	Changes in the unobservable input values would be unlikely to cause material changes in the fair value of the auction rate security.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P75_S0	The Level 3 assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for the contingent consideration included projected revenues, estimates of discount rates of 6.2% and timing of cash flows.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P75_S1	A significant decrease in the projected revenues or increase in discount rates could result in a significantly lower fair value measurement for the contingent consideration.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	This table presents a reconciliation for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the year ended December 31, 2013 :
1094392_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	See Note 5 for additional discussion regarding the fair value of the Company s marketable securities.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P78_S0	The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P78_S1	The estimated fair value of these obligations is based, primarily, on a market approach, comparing the Company s interest rates to those rates the Company believes it would reasonably receive upon re-entry into the market.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P78_S2	Judgment is required to estimate the fair value, using available market information and appropriate valuation methods.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P79_S0	The Company s convertible senior notes are not publicly traded.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P79_S1	The estimated fair value of the Company s convertible senior notes was valued using a discounted cash flow model.

1094392_14_ITEM15_P97_S1	On and after April 15, 2016 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of July 15, 2016 , holders may convert their notes, in multiples of $1 principal amount, regardless of whether any of the foregoing conditions have been met.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P97_S2	Upon conversion, the Company will deliver to holders in respect of each $1 principal amount of Notes being converted a settlement amount equal to the sum of the daily settlement amounts for each of the 40 consecutive trading days during the applicable cash settlement averaging period.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P97_S3	The conversion value of each Note will be paid in: 1) cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be converted, and 2) to the extent the conversion value exceeds the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted, the Company s common stock in respect of the remainder (plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of common stock).
1094392_14_ITEM15_P97_S4	The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain circumstances but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.

1094392_14_ITEM15_P99_S0	The following table presents the amount of interest cost recognized relating to the Notes during the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2012 and 2013 .
1094392_14_ITEM15_P100_S0	The remaining bond discount of the Notes of $8,249 , as of December 31, 2013 will be amortized over the remaining life of the Notes.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P101_S0	Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, the Company purchased a convertible note hedge and sold a warrant.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P101_S1	Each of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions were entered into with an affiliate of the initial purchaser of the Notes (the Option Counterparty ).
1094392_14_ITEM15_P101_S2	The convertible note hedge is intended to reduce the potential future dilution to the Company s common stock associated with the conversion of the Notes.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P101_S3	However, the warrant transaction will have a dilutive effect on the Company s earnings per share to the extent that the price of the Company s common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrant.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P102_S0	The strike price of the warrant is initially $17.00 per share.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P102_S1	Each of these components is discussed separately below: Convertible Note Hedge .
1094392_14_ITEM15_P103_S0	The Option Counterparty agreed to sell to the Company up to approximately 4,634 shares of the Company s common stock, which is the maximum number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, at a price of $12.95 per share.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P103_S1	The convertible note hedge transaction will be settled in shares of the Company s common stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) and will expire on the earlier of the second scheduled trading day (as defined in the Indenture) prior to the maturity date of the Notes or the last day any of the Notes remain outstanding.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P103_S2	Subject to certain terms and conditions, settlement of the convertible note hedge would result in the Company receiving shares of the Company s common stock equivalent to the number of shares that the Company is obligated to deliver to holders of the Notes upon conversion of the Notes.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P103_S3	The Company will not be required to make any cash payments to the Option Counterparty or its affiliates upon the exercise of the options that are a part of the convertible note hedge transaction, but will be entitled to receive from the Option Counterparty a number of shares of Company common stock generally based on the amount by which the market price per share of Company common stock, as measured under the terms of the convertible note hedge transaction, is greater than the strike price of the convertible note hedge transaction during the relevant valuation period under the convertible note hedge transaction.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P103_S4	The convertible note hedge transaction cost of $14,507 has been accounted for as an equity transaction.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P103_S5	The Company received $7,007 from the Option Counterparty from the sale of the warrant to purchase up to approximately 4,634 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $17.00 per share.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P103_S6	As of December 31, 2013 , the warrant had an expected life of 3.0 years and expires between October 13, 2016 and January 9, 2017 .
1094392_14_ITEM15_P103_S7	As of December 31, 2013 , the warrant had not been exercised and remained outstanding.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P103_S8	Additionally, if the market price per share of Company common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant transaction, exceeds the strike price of the warrant during the valuation period at the maturity of the warrant, the Company will owe the Option Counterparty a number of shares of Company common stock in an amount based on the excess of such market price per share of Company common stock over the strike price of the warrant.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P104_S0	The fair value of the warrant was initially recorded in equity and continues to be classified as equity.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P105_S0	The convertible note hedge transaction and the warrant transaction are separate transactions entered into by the Company.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P105_S1	Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the convertible note hedge transaction and the warrant transaction.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P106_S0	The Company has entered into agreements with customers that include limited intellectual property indemnification obligations that are customary in the industry.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P106_S1	These guarantees generally require the Company to compensate the other party for certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising from these transactions.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P107_S0	The nature of the intellectual property indemnification obligations prevents the Company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay to its customers.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P107_S1	Historically, the Company has not made any indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P108_S0	The Company generally provides a warranty on its products for a period of twelve to fifteen months against defects in material and workmanship.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P108_S1	The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred during the warranty period and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P108_S2	The Company s estimate is based primarily on historical experience.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P108_S3	The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P108_S4	Settlements of warranty reserves are generally associated with sales that occurred during the 12 to 15 months prior to the year-end and warranty accruals are related to sales during the year.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P108_S5	Changes in the Company s warranty reserves are as follows:
1094392_14_ITEM15_P109_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company had a $40,000 irrevocable standby letter of credit with Credit Suisse AG available to secure the damages assessment in connection with the ITC litigation discussed in Legal Matters below, which the Company is in the process of appealing.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P109_S1	The letter of credit contains a provision for automatic renewal each year.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P109_S2	Upon draw down of funds, the letter of credit would be collateralized by securities held in the Company s investment portfolios and reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets within the caption Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable securities.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P109_S3	No amounts were outstanding on the letter of credit as of, or during the year ended, December 31, 2013 .
1094392_14_ITEM15_P110_S0	Legal Matters From time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P111_S0	As previously disclosed, in December 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of specific assets and liabilities of the semiconductor division of Applied Precision LLC ( Applied ).
1094392_14_ITEM15_P112_S0	assumed certain liabilities of Applied including a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court, District of Arizona, by Integrated Technology Corporation ( ITC ) which alleged Applied s PrecisionPoint , PrecisionWoRx and ProbeWoRx products infringed an ITC patent (Integrated Technology Corporation v. Rudolph Technologies, Inc., No. CV-06-2182-PHX-ROS).
1094392_14_ITEM15_P112_S1	Prior to trial, the District Court ruled that such products sold prior to August of 2007 (the pre-August 2007 tools ) infringed the ITC patent.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P112_S2	At trial in December of 2011, a trial verdict was rendered in which the jury found that while the Company s products manufactured after August of 2007 (the post-August 2007 tools ) did not literally infringe ITC s patent, the products were found to infringe under a rule known as the doctrine of equivalents, a legal principle which expands the language of patent claims to encompass products or processes which may otherwise be found not to literally infringe the patent.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P112_S3	The jury awarded $15,475 to ITC in damages for sales made during the years 2000-2011, of which award approximately one-half related to sales for pre-August 2007 tools.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P112_S4	The jury found that for the sales of the post-August 2007 tools, the infringement was willful.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P112_S5	On July 23, 2012, the District Court issued an Order which affirmed the jury s award, applied treble damages to the portion of the jury award related to post-August 2007 tool sales and granted ITC s motion for attorney s fees and prejudgment interest on the verdict and attorney s fees.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P112_S6	At that time, the District Court also enjoined the Company from future infringement of the ITC patent and from selling or supplying the applicable products with the applicable features from or into the United States.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P112_S7	The Company appealed the injunction, the District Court Order and the damages assessment.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P112_S8	In October 2012, the injunction was stayed by the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals and thereafter in June of 2013, the patent expired.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P112_S9	On November 4, 2013, the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals issued a ruling which reversed the judgment of infringement against all post-August 2007 tools, reversed the finding of willfulness, vacated the treble damages award, vacated the award of attorney s fees and costs, remanded the issue back to the District Court for further review, and affirmed the award of damages and interest for the pre-August 2007 tools.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P112_S10	As a result, the matter is resolved with regard to the alleged infringement of the post-August 2007 tools.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P112_S11	With regard to the damages assessment against the pre-August 2007 tools, the Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and shall continue to vigorously prosecute our appeal regarding this issue.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P112_S12	However, it is probable that the Company could realize a loss in this matter regarding the pre-August 2007 tools for which the Company has estimated and recorded a liability of approximately $4,293 in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P112_S13	The maximum liability reasonably possible for the pre-August 2007 products, including damages and interest, is an additional $6,285 plus attorney s fees beyond the accrual.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P113_S0	While the Company continues to believe that its current PrecisionWoRx and ProbeWoRx systems do not infringe ITC s patent, the Company reached an agreement with ITC in October 2012 with regards to a redesign of the products under which ITC agreed that such redesign is permissible under the court s injunction.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P114_S0	In the Company s patent infringement suit against Camtek, Ltd., of Migdal Hamek, Israel, concerning the Company s proprietary continuous scan wafer inspection technology, the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals issued a ruling on August 22, 2011.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P114_S1	No. 6,826,298 valid, (ii) the part of the infringement ruling based on the finding that Camtek s Falcon product strobes based on velocity, and (iii) the dismissal of Camtek s claim against the Company for inequitable conduct against the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P114_S2	The court did, however, revise one claim construction ruling made by the District Court in the original case.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P114_S3	As a result, the Appellate Court set aside the verdict delivered by the jury for damages and the District Court s decision to enter an injunction against Camtek s selling Falcon tools in the U.S. and remanded the case back to the trial court for a limited trial on this single infringement issue.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P114_S4	No trial date has been set for this limited trial.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P115_S0	This lawsuit was initially brought in 2005 by August Technology prior to its merger with the Company.

1094392_14_ITEM15_P116_S3	Rent expense related to these leases amounted to $111 , $123 and $171 for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2012 and 2013 , respectively.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P117_S0	Total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2013 amounted to $3,873 for 2014 , $3,712 for 2015 , $2,682 for 2016 , $2,037 for 2017 , $1,955 for 2018 and $704 for all periods thereafter.

1094392_14_ITEM15_P138_S0	The income tax benefit of $4,832 and $14,458 in 2011 and 2012, respectively, primarily resulted from benefits related to the release of valuation allowance recorded against U.S. deferred tax assets, partially offset by taxes accrued in both the U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P139_S0	related to the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits, foreign tax credits and research and development credits for both 2012 and 2013 recognized in 2013, which were not available in 2012 as a result of legislation, and $1.3 million of expense related to a correction of the prior year income tax balances recognized in the fourth quarter of 2013.

1094392_14_ITEM15_P142_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company uses a more likely than not standard.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P142_S1	If it is determined that it is more-likely-than-not that deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against the deferred tax assets.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P143_S0	The ultimate realization of the assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences become deductible.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P143_S1	Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies when making this assessment.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P144_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2012 and 2013 to income before provision for income taxes as follows:
1094392_14_ITEM15_P145_S0	At December 31, 2013 , the Company had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $1,371 , $399 and $516 , respectively.

1094392_14_ITEM15_P145_S5	The foreign tax credit is set to expire at various dates through December 31, 2023 .
1094392_14_ITEM15_P146_S0	The 2013 benefit for income taxes includes a benefit of $1,993 for unrecognized tax benefits, a provision of $850 for the correction of a prior year income tax balance recognized in the fourth quarter and a provision of $625 related to an Internal Revenue Service audit adjustment.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P146_S1	These amounts are included in the Other line item.

1094392_14_ITEM15_P146_S3	Upon distribution of those earnings, U.S. taxes on such permanently reinvested foreign earnings would be recorded net of applicable foreign tax credits and withholding taxes, if any.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P147_S0	It is not practical to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be remitted.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P147_S1	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:
1094392_14_ITEM15_P148_S0	Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2012 and 2013 are unrecognized tax benefits of $6,272 and $4,278 , respectively, which would be reflected as an adjustment to income tax expense if recognized.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P149_S0	The year over year decrease from 2012 to 2013 is primarily due to the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits related to federal tax exposures.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P149_S1	It is reasonably possible that certain amounts of unrecognized tax benefits may reverse in the next 12 months; however, we do not expect such reversals would have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P150_S0	The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

1094392_14_ITEM15_P151_S1	The provisions under this law were made retroactive to January 1, 2012.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P151_S2	However, as a result of the law being signed on January 1, 2013, the financial impact of any retroactive provision was recorded as a discrete event in the first quarter of 2013.
1094392_14_ITEM15_P151_S3	This discrete event reduced tax expense in the first quarter of 2013 by approximately $800 for research and development tax credits for 2012.

1094392_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	Advanced packaging has driven development of copper pillar bumps and Through Silicon Vias ( TSV ) as key enabling technologies where 2.5D and 3D assembly schemes are driving the More than Moore roadmap.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	To meet the critical need for measuring thick films, Rudolph launched SONUS Technology in 2014.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	A unique bulk acoustic metrology and defect detection technology that is non-contact and non-destructive.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	thick films and film stacks (e.g. copper pillar bumps), detect voids and cracks in metal films (e.g. TSVs) and identify areas of delamination.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	Rudolph achieved record installations of both its Advanced Process Control ( APC ) software and yield management software ( YMS ) in 2014.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Critical to customers is the ability to maintain yield during high-volume manufacturing.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	APC software such as run-to-run control and fault detection and classification software can be deployed into our customers manufacturing lines within days, where they will run continuously, to help improve the manufacturing process and increase yield.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Yield management software meets the demand for productivity information driven by the need for increased yields.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	Rudolph s fully-integrated YMS solutions are designed to analyze data from disparate sources and multiple sites to maximize productivity across the entire value chain.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P6_S2	In 2014 Rudolph saw increased adoption of its NSX Metrology Series, a combined 3D metrology and inspection system, developed following Rudolph s acquisition of selected assets of Tamar Technology ( Tamar ), a precision metrology company, of Newbury Park, CA, in April 2013.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P6_S3	The NSX Metrology Series is designed to meet our customers need for throughput and process integration in high-volume production advanced packaging applications.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	Rudolph earned certification to ISO 9001:2008 from SAI Global, an accredited registrar, for its lithography systems group in 2014.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	This final registration compliments the Company s prior registration of its three other business units, inspection, metrology and software, completed in 2013.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	The Company is now registered for the design, manufacture, sale and support of capital equipment and process control software used for inspection, metrology, yield analysis and control of semiconductor and related device manufacturing processes, lithography for display products and advanced packaging.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	Industry Trends Advanced Packaging is a key technology that enables the miniaturization of electronic products, such as portable consumer devices, including smartphones and laptops.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	In electronics manufacturing, integrated circuit packaging is the final stage of semiconductor device fabrication, in which the tiny block of semiconducting material (die) is encased in a supporting package that provides an external electrical connection and prevents physical damage and corrosion.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	Packaging refers loosely to the conductors and other structures that interconnect the circuits, feed them with electric power, discharge their heat and protect them from damage.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	Today, the drive to pack more functions into a small space and reduce their power requirements demands that chip packages do much more than ever before.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P9_S3	Examples of advanced packaging are varied and include flip-chip bumping, pillar bumping, wafer-level chip scale packaging and 3D packaging.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P9_S4	One solution using advanced packaging is the 3D integration of semiconductors and other devices.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P9_S5	The technology involves stacking individual die or wafers in one integrated housing.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P9_S6	Through silicon vias (TSV, 3D stacking) allow communication among the individual components.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P9_S7	This offers the advantages of shorter signal paths and reduced power consumption, enhanced bandwidths, integration of heterogeneous components such as sub-chips, smaller surface area and reduced expense.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P9_S8	The processes required for 3D integration are still being optimized for yield, and to ensure the functioning of individual microchips.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	The current and projected adoption of smart mobile devices drives designed-in capability.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	There are no longer single function devices, but instead, various devices have been combined to provide multiple functions.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P10_S2	For example, smart phone users no longer need a GPS, digital camera and PDA.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P10_S3	With the addition of a myriad of available apps, the potential uses seem endless.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P10_S4	As a result, advancements in mobile products are driving semiconductor advanced packaging and display manufacturers to implement next-generation technologies to meet the resulting requirements.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P10_S5	This technology shift has created multiple opportunities for Rudolph solutions.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	Scalable technology is rapidly increasing in importance.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	Advanced packaging facilities looking to improve Cost of Ownership ( COO ) and increase productivity are transitioning to large rectangular panels ranging up to Gen 3.5 (approximately 650mm x 720mm).
1094392_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	Traditional technology has been limited to standard wafer sizes.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	However, with companies progressively moving to fan-out packages, they are no longer limited to operating within the constraints of a round wafer.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	By responding to market opportunities and addressing the stringent demands of customers technical roadmaps, Rudolph is optimally positioned to capitalize on the emerging market of advanced packaging panel lithography.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	The JetStep S Series, having emerged from the flat panel display market, is readily capable of processing both glass and organic laminate panels in the semiconductor advanced packaging market.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	Multiple Rudolph systems continue to support 450mm wafer processing research and development.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our latest-generation defect inspection and thin film metrology tools are designed to increase the value of inspection and metrology data to improve process yields and profitability as the industry moves toward a full 450mm production ramp.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	Technology We believe that our expertise in engineering and our continued investment in research and development enable us to rapidly develop new technologies and products in response to emerging industry trends.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	The breadth of our technology enables us to offer a diverse combination of measurement technologies that provide process control for the majority of thin films used in semiconductor manufacturing.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	Unique features have been designed into our lithography systems to meet our customers changing process requirements.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P15_S3	Our defect detection and classification technologies allow us to provide yield enhancement for critical front-end processes such as photolithography, diffusion, etch, CMP and outgoing quality control.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	Information learned through post-fab inspection is critical.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	Advanced macro defect inspection within the final manufacturing (back-end) process provides our customers with critical quality assurance and process information.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing or general handling, and can have a major impact on device and process quality.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	Chip manufacturers deploy advanced macro defect inspection throughout the fab to monitor key process steps, gather process-enhancing information and ultimately, lower manufacturing costs.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	Field-established tools such as the F30 and NSX inspection systems are found in wafer processing (front-end) and final manufacturing (back-end) facilities around the world.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P17_S3	These high-speed tools incorporate features such as waferless recipe creation, tool-to-tool correlation and multiple inspection resolutions.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P17_S4	In addition to wafer frontside inspection, Rudolph s innovative Explorer Inspection Cluster incorporates wafer edge and backside inspection in one integrated platform to enhance productivity and continuously improve fab yield.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	Using Discover yield management software, the vast amount of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed and classified to determine trends that ultimately affect yield.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	All-surface refers to inspection of the wafer frontside, edge, and backside as well as post-fab die.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	The edge inspection process focuses on the area near the wafer edge, an area that poses difficulty for traditional wafer frontside inspection technology due to its varied topography and process variation.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	Edge bevel inspection looks for defects on the side edge of a wafer.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	Edge bead removal and edge exclusion metrology involve a topside surface measurement required exclusively in the photolithography process, primarily to determine if wafers have been properly aligned for the edge exclusion region.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	The primary reason for wafer backside inspection is to determine if contamination has been created that may spread throughout the fab.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	For instance, it is critical that the wafer backside be free of defects prior to the photolithography process to prevent focus and exposure problems on the wafer frontside.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	Automating the defect detection and classification process is best done by a system that can mimic, or even extend, the response of the human eye, but at a much higher speed, with high resolution and more consistency.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	To do this, our systems capture full-color whole wafer images using simultaneous dark and bright field illumination.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	The resulting bright and dark field images are compared to those from an ideal wafer having no defects.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P23_S3	When a difference is detected, its image is broken down into mathematical vectors that allow rapid and accurate comparison with a library of known classified defects stored in the tool s database.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P23_S4	Patented and proprietary enhancements of this approach enable very fast and highly repeatable image classification.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P23_S5	The system is pre-programmed with an extensive library of default local, global and color defects and can also absorb a virtually unlimited amount of new defect classes.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P23_S6	This allows customers to define defects based on their existing defect classification system, provides more reliable automated rework decisions and enables more accurate statistical process control data.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P23_S7	Classifying defects off-line enables automated inspection systems to maintain their high throughput.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P23_S8	Using defect image files captured by automated inspection systems, operators are able to view high-resolution defect images to determine defects that cause catastrophic failure of a device, or killer defects.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	defects of similar types across a wafer lot to be grouped based on size, repeating defects and other user-defined specifications.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	Automatically classifying defects provides far greater yield learning than human classification.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	Using wafer maps, charts and graphs, the vast amounts of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed to determine trends across bumps, die, wafers and lots.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	This analysis may determine where in the process a variation is being introduced, allowing for enhancements to be made and yields improved.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	Defect data analysis is performed to identify, analyze and locate the source of defects and other manufacturing process excursions.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	Using either a single wafer map or a composite map created from multiple wafer maps, this analysis enables identification of defect patterns and distribution.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P26_S2	When combined with inspection data from strategically-placed inspection points, this analysis may pinpoint the source of the defects so corrective action can be taken.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P26_S3	The combination of Fast 3D-OCM (optical comparative metrology) Technology with improved testing accuracy and repeatability is designed to reduce total test time for even the most advanced large area probe cards.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P26_S4	The 3-D capabilities enable users to analyze probe marks and probe tips in a rapid and information-rich format.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	Lithography Business Step and Repeat Technology.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Rudolph steppers use projection optics to expose circuit patterns from a mask or reticle onto a substrate to achieve images with optimal fidelity.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	These systems employ light from a mercury arc lamp that is transmitted through a mask or reticle containing display circuit patterns.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	Substrates are aligned on the system and the mask is imaged through a projection lens in photoresist material coated on the substrate.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P29_S2	The substrate is then moved, or stepped, to a second position to expose an adjacent area.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P29_S3	Images can be stitched together precisely to form larger circuit patterns without any noticeable change in circuit performance.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P29_S4	The system repeats the step and exposure process until the entire substrate is patterned.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P29_S5	Once the exposure process has been completed, the substrate is developed with an alkali solution, such as Tetramethylammonium Hydroxide ( TMAH ) or sodium hydroxide ( NaOH ), to reveal the underlying material.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P29_S6	The imaged photoresist serves as a barrier that allows for processing the underlying metal or insulating layers.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P29_S7	The substrates then continue through the etching, stripping and deposition processes until multi-layer circuits are completed.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	In order to deal with increased Input/Output, enhanced functionality, power efficiency and higher frequency, Integrated Device Manufacturers and Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test facilities ( OSATs ) are moving to advanced packaging technologies such as TSV and three Dimensional Integrated Circuits ( 3DIC ).
1094392_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	However, the associated substrates and processes are significantly different than those used in front-end wafer processing.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P30_S2	The added performance requires finer features, but the processes stress the substrates resulting in warped substrates.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	Since most packaging is an additive process, thick films are used to enable the creation of features.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	In order for equipment to effectively function in this environment, it must overcome these challenges.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P31_S2	Rudolph s JetStep Systems have been specifically designed to meet these challenges head on.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P31_S3	The JetStep W Series is designed for wafers and other round substrates while the JetStep S Series is designed for rectangular substrates (panels).
1094392_15_ITEM1_P31_S4	Both systems boast a large printable field, which when combined with user-selectable wavelength options, maximizes throughput while not limiting resolution when needed.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P31_S5	High fidelity optics are able to image the fine features required while at the same time achieving superior depth of field to minimize non-flatness effects.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P31_S6	On-the-fly auto focus and an innovative reticle management system improve yield and utilization.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P31_S7	These unique features result in a revolutionary lithography system specifically designed to meet advanced packaging challenges.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	Flat Panel Display ( FPD ) Lithography .
1094392_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	A critical aspect of any leading mobile device is the display.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	The display serves as the window to the user.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	Therefore, it must effectively present graphics such as detailed maps, high resolution photos and streaming video in order to meet user expectations.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P33_S3	To accomplish this, the display transistor backplane, which is what controls the pixels, must operate at a high frequency and have high pixel resolution.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P33_S4	As a result, the transistors must have high mobility and only use a small portion of the pixel aperture.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	The backplane is manufactured on a sheet of glass; like the packaging substrate, it is non-flat and tends to distort further during processing.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	Additionally, the displays are getting larger.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	Manufacturers are looking to utilize larger sheets of glass, making throughput a challenge for the lithography equipment.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P34_S3	To overcome this, Rudolph s JetStep G Series uses high-fidelity optics and the largest printable stepper field available enabling more displays per shot.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P34_S4	This feature, combined with on-the-fly auto-focus and magnification compensation, maximizes throughput and yield.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P34_S5	Finally, the innovative grid stage allows the system to be easily scaled to meet the customer desired substrate size.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	Optical acoustic metrology involves the use of ultra-fast laser induced sonar for metal and opaque thin film measurement.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	This technology sends ultrasonic waves into multi-layer opaque films and then analyzes the resulting echoes to simultaneously determine the thickness of each individual layer in complex multi-layer metal film stacks.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P35_S2	The echo s amplitude and phase can be used to detect film properties, missing layers and interlayer problems.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P35_S3	Since different phenomena affect amplitude and phase uniquely, a variety of process critical interlayer problems can be detected in a single measurement.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	The use of optical acoustics to measure multi-layer metal and opaque films was pioneered by scientists at Brown University ( Brown ) in collaboration with engineers at Rudolph.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	The proprietary optical acoustic technology in our PULSE Technology systems measures the thickness of single or multi-layer opaque films ranging from less than 40 Angstroms to greater than five microns.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P36_S2	It provides these measurements at a rate of up to 70 wafers per hour within one to two percent accuracy and typically less than one percent repeatability.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P36_S3	This range of thicknesses covers the majority of thick and thin metal films projected by the International Roadmap for Semiconductors to be used through the end of this decade.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our non-contact, non-destructive optical acoustic technology and small spot size enable our PULSE Technology systems to measure film properties directly on product wafers.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	The Meta PULSE System gives customers the ability to simultaneously measure the thickness and other properties of up to six metal or other opaque film layers in a non-contact manner on product wafers.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	PULSE Technology uses an ultra-fast laser to generate sound waves that pass down through a stack of opaque films such as those used in copper or aluminum interconnect processes, sending back to the surface an echo that indicates film thickness, density, and other process critical parameters.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	We believe we are a leader in providing systems that can non-destructively measure opaque thin-film stacks with the speed and accuracy semiconductor device manufacturers demand in order to achieve high yields with the latest fabrication processes.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P38_S2	The technology is ideal for characterizing copper interconnect structures.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P38_S3	The Meta PULSE System, used mainly for fast and accurate measurements of metal interconnect in front-end wafer processing applications, has now been chosen by back-end manufacturers to perform system measurements in new process applications, driven by the need for on-product metrology as feature sizes decrease and pattern densities increase.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	Launched in 2014, SONUS Technology is designed for measuring thick films and film stacks used in copper pillar bumps and for detecting defects, such as voids, in TSVs.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	SONUS Technology is a non-contact, non-destructive acoustic metrology and defect detection technique that is designed to be of higher resolution, faster, and less costly than alternative techniques.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P39_S2	SONUS Technology meets a critical need for measuring and inspecting the structures used to connect chips to each other and to the outside world.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P39_S3	Copper pillar bumps and TSVs are critical interconnect technologies enabling 2.5D and 3D packaging.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	Plating process control for copper pillar bumping is directly related to the mechanical integrity of the interconnect and final device performance.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	Likewise, the quality of the TSV fill is critical to the electrical performance of stacked devices.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	Rudolph s patented SONUS Technology offers the unique ability to measure individual films and film stacks to thicknesses of 100 m and detect voids as small as 0.5 m in TSVs with aspect ratios of 10:1 or greater.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	Ellipsometry is a non-contact, non-destructive optical technique for transparent thin film measurement.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	We have been an industry leader in ellipsometry technology for the last three decades.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P42_S2	We hold patents on several ellipsometry technologies, including our proprietary technique that uses four lasers for multiple-angle of incidence, multiple wavelength ellipsometry.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P42_S3	Laser ellipsometry technology is intended to enable our transparent film systems to provide the increasingly higher level of accuracy needed as thinner films and newer materials are introduced for future generations of semiconductor devices.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P42_S4	We extended this same optical technology to characterize the scatterometry signal from patterned surfaces, allowing measurement of critical dimensions.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P42_S5	For applications requiring broader spectral coverage, some of our ellipsometry tools are also equipped with a reflectometer.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	Reflectometry uses a white or ultraviolet light source to determine the properties of transparent thin films by analyzing the wavelength and intensity of light reflected from the surface of a wafer.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	This optical information is processed with software algorithms to determine film thickness and other material properties.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P43_S2	By combining data from both the laser ellipsometer and broad spectrum reflectometer, it is possible to characterize films and film stacks that cannot be adequately analyzed by either method individually.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	Rudolph s patented transparent film technology uses up to four lasers operating simultaneously at multiple angles and multiple wavelengths, providing powerful analysis and measurement capabilities.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	Unlike the white-light sources used in spectroscopic ellipsometers, laser light sources make our metrology tools inherently stable, increase measurement speed and accuracy, and reduce maintenance costs by minimizing the time required to re-qualify a light source when it is replaced.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	Rudolph s S3000SX System is targeted for transparent films in advanced semiconductor fabrication applications at the 28nm node and below.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	The S3000 product family uses Rudolph s proprietary Focused Beam Ellipsometry ( FBE ) and newly-designed Small Site Measurement Optics ( SSMO ) to measure the thickness of single layer and multi-layer films on product wafers including device area at site sizes as small as 30x30 nanometers.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Yield Management and Process Control Software Process Control .
1094392_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	We provide a wide range of advanced process control solutions, all designed to improve factory profitability, including run-to-run control, fault detection, classification and tool automation.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	Rudolph is a leading provider of Process Control Software in the semiconductor industry.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	APC employs software to automatically detect or predict tool failure (fault detection) as well as calculate recipe settings for a process that will drive the process output to target despite variations in the incoming material and disturbances within the process equipment.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	Process control software enables the factory to increase capacity and yield and to decrease rework and scrap.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	It enables reduced production costs by lowering consumables, process engineering time and manufacturing cycle time.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	Semiconductor manufacturers use YMS to obtain valuable process yield and equipment productivity information.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P50_S3	The data necessary to generate productivity information comes from many different sources throughout the fab: inspection and metrology systems, tool sensors, tool recipes, electrical tests and the fab environment.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P50_S4	As the complexity and cost of manufacturing processes increase, the value of faster, better analysis to support critical manufacturing decisions grows too, so customers are demanding robust yield management systems that can analyze large, complex data sets quickly and effectively.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	Rudolph s fully-integrated YMS are designed to analyze data from disparate sources and multiple sites to maximize productivity across the entire value chain.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	Products Rudolph markets and sells products to major logic, memory, data storage, flat panel and application-specific integrated circuit ( ASIC ) device manufacturers.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	Our customers rely on us for versatile inspection, lithography and metrology systems as well as process control software solutions.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P52_S2	These systems are designed for high-volume production facilities and offer automated wafer handling for 200, 300 and 450mm configurations.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P52_S3	Our systems operate at high throughput with ultra-clean operation and high reliability.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	Customers Over 100 microelectronic device manufacturers have purchased Rudolph tools and software for installation at multiple sites.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P53_S1	We support a diverse customer base in terms of both geographic location and type of device manufactured.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P53_S2	Our customers are located in 20 countries.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P53_S3	See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information concerning our geographic information.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	We depend on a relatively small number of customers and end users for a large percentage of our revenues.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	In the years 2012 , 2013 and 2014 , sales to end user customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for 50.9% , 41.6% and 23.9% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	The following customers each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for the indicated periods:
1094392_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	We do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	Research and Development The markets for equipment and systems for manufacturing semiconductor devices and for performing macro-defect inspection, advanced packaging lithography and thin film transparent and opaque process control metrology are characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	We believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products is critical to our success.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P57_S2	Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our technical, management and financial resources to research and development programs.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P57_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , we employed 158 research and development personnel.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P57_S4	Our research and development expenditures in 2012 , 2013 and 2014 were $39.3 million , $40.0 million and $40.6 million , respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P57_S5	We expect to continue our strong commitment to new product development and continue to allocate significant resources to these efforts in the future.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	We maintain an extensive network of direct sales, customer service and application support offices in the United States, Europe and Asia.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	We provide our customers with comprehensive support before, during and after the delivery of our products.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P58_S2	For example, in order to facilitate the smooth integration of our tools into our customers operations, we often assign dedicated, site-specific field service and applications engineers to provide long-term support at selected customer sites.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P58_S3	We also provide comprehensive service and applications training for customers at our training facilities in Bloomington, Minnesota and Budd Lake, New Jersey and at customer locations.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P58_S4	In addition, we maintain a group of highly skilled applications scientists at strategically located facilities throughout the world and at selected customer locations.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P58_S5	As of December 31, 2014 , we employed 274 sales and marketing, service and applications support personnel.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	Manufacturing Our principal manufacturing activities include assembly, final test and calibration.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	These activities are conducted in our manufacturing facilities in Bloomington, Minnesota and Wilmington, Massachusetts.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P59_S2	Our core manufacturing competencies include electrical, optical and mechanical assembly and testing, as well as the management of new product transitions.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P59_S3	While we use standard components and subassemblies wherever possible, most mechanical parts, metal fabrications and critical components used in our products are engineered and manufactured to our specifications.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P59_S4	We continue to rely on subcontractors and turnkey suppliers to fabricate components, build assemblies and perform other non-core activities in a cost-effective manner.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P59_S5	As of December 31, 2014 , we employed 84 manufacturing personnel.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	We rely on a number of limited source suppliers for certain parts and subassemblies.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P60_S1	This reliance creates a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components, and reduced control over pricing and time of delivery of components.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P60_S2	An inability to obtain adequate supplies would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or might require us to redesign our systems to accommodate different components or subassemblies.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P60_S3	To date, we have not experienced any significant delivery delays.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P60_S4	However, if we were forced to seek alternative sources of supply, manufacture such components or subassemblies internally, or redesign our products, this could prevent us from shipping our products to our customers on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	We have a policy of seeking patents on inventions governing new products or technologies as part of our ongoing research, development, and manufacturing activities.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , we have been granted, or hold exclusive licenses to, 253 U.S. and foreign patents.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P61_S2	The patents we own, jointly own or exclusively license have expiration dates ranging from 2015 to 2034 .
1094392_15_ITEM1_P61_S3	We also have 96 pending regular and provisional applications in the U.S. and other countries.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P61_S4	Our patents and applications principally cover various aspects of macro-defect detection and classification, transparent thin film measurement, altered material characterization, lithography techniques and automation.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P61_S5	We have been granted exclusive licenses from Brown University Research Foundation, subject to rights retained by Brown and the United States government for their own non-commercial uses, for several patents relating to the optical acoustic technology underlying our MetaPULSE product family.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P61_S6	The terms of these exclusive licenses are equal to the lives of the patents.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P61_S7	We pay royalties to Brown based upon a percentage of our revenues from the sale of systems that incorporate technology covered by the Brown patents.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P61_S8	We also have the right to support patent activity with respect to new ultra-fast acoustic technology developed by Brown scientists, and to acquire exclusive licenses to this technology.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P61_S9	Brown may terminate the licenses if we fail to pay royalties to Brown or if we materially breach our license agreement with Brown.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P61_S10	Our pending patents may never be issued, and even if they are, these patents, our existing patents and the patents we license may not provide sufficiently broad protection to protect our proprietary rights, or they may prove to be unenforceable.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P61_S11	To protect our proprietary rights, we also rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions and licenses.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P61_S12	There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same degree as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial infringement problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in such countries, some of which are countries in which we have sold and continue to sell products.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	There is a risk that our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P62_S2	For example, our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P62_S3	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	Competition The market for semiconductor capital equipment is highly competitive.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P63_S1	We face substantial competition from established companies in each of the markets that we serve.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P63_S2	We principally compete with KLA-Tencor, Camtek and Ultratech.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P63_S3	We compete to a lesser extent with companies such as Nanometrics, Nova Measuring Instruments and Nikon.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P63_S4	Each of our products also competes with products that use different metrology techniques.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P63_S5	Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, broader product offerings and service capabilities and larger installed customer bases than we do.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P63_S6	Significant competitive factors in the market for inspection and metrology systems include system performance, ease of use, reliability, cost of ownership, technical support and customer relationships.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P63_S7	We believe that, while price and delivery are important competitive factors, the customers overriding requirement is for a product that meets their technical capabilities.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P63_S8	To remain competitive, we believe we will need to maintain a high level of investment in research and development and process applications.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P63_S9	No assurances can be given that we will continue to be competitive in the future.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	Backlog We schedule production of our systems based upon order backlog and informal customer forecasts.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	We include in backlog only those orders to which the customer has assigned a purchase order number and for which delivery is anticipated within 12 months.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P64_S2	Because shipment dates may be changed and customers may cancel or delay orders with little or no penalty, our backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P64_S3	At December 31, 2014 , we had a backlog of approximately $37.6 million compared with a backlog of approximately $30.8 million at December 31, 2013 .
1094392_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	Employees As of December 31, 2014 , we had 586 employees.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements, and we have never experienced a work stoppage.
1094392_15_ITEM1_P65_S2	We believe our employee relations are good.

1094392_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Risks Related to Rudolph Our operating results have varied, and will likely continue to vary significantly, from quarter to quarter in the future, causing volatility in our stock price Our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and will likely continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, causing volatility in our stock price.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Some of the factors that may influence our operating results and subject our stock to extreme price and volume fluctuations include:
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	the levels of our fixed expenses, including research and development costs associated with product development, relative to our revenue levels.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	In light of these factors and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Moreover, many of our expenses are fixed in the short-term which, together with the need for continued investment in research and development, marketing and customer support, limits our ability to reduce expenses quickly.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	As a result, declines in net sales could harm our business and the price of our common stock could substantially decline.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Our largest customers account for a significant portion of our revenues, and our revenues and cash flows could significantly decline if one or more of these customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems or they delayed or canceled a large order Sales to end user customers that individually represent at least five percent of our revenues typically account for, in the aggregate, a considerable amount of our revenues.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We operate in the highly concentrated, capital-intensive semiconductor device manufacturing industry.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Historically, a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers, and this trend is expected to continue.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	If any of our key customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems in the future, or if a large order were delayed or canceled, our revenues and cash flows could significantly decline.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	We expect that we will continue to depend on a small number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenues.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P3_S4	In addition, as large semiconductor device manufacturers seek to establish closer relationships with their suppliers, we expect that our customer base will become even more concentrated.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Our customers may be unable to pay us for our products and services Our customers include some companies that may from time to time encounter financial difficulties, especially in light of the current economic environment and the difficulties in the credit markets.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P3_S6	If a customer s financial difficulties become severe, the customer may be unwilling or unable to pay our invoices in the ordinary course of business, which could adversely affect collections of both our accounts receivable and unbilled services.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P3_S7	The bankruptcy of a customer with a substantial account receivable could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P3_S8	In addition, if a customer declares bankruptcy after paying us certain invoices, a court may determine that we are not properly entitled to that payment and may require repayment of some or all of the amount we received, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P3_S9	Variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our systems may cause fluctuations in our operating results, which could cause our stock price to decline Variations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our revenues and cash flows, and consequently, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, to fluctuate widely from period to period.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P3_S10	This variation could cause our stock price to decline.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P3_S11	Our customers generally take a long time to evaluate our inspection and/or film metrology systems and many people are involved in the evaluation process.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P3_S12	We expend significant resources educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our systems in the semiconductor fabrication process.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P3_S13	The length of time it takes for us to make a sale depends upon many factors including, but not limited to:
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	the quality and sophistication of the customer s current metrology, inspection or lithography equipment.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Because of the number of factors influencing the sales process, the period between our initial contact with a customer and the time when we recognize revenue from that customer and receive payment, if ever, varies widely in length.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our sales cycles, including the time it takes for us to build a product to customer specifications after receiving an order to the time we recognize revenue, typically range from six to twenty-four months.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Sometimes our sales cycles can be much longer, particularly with customers in Japan.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	If we do make a sale, our customers often purchase only one of our systems, and then evaluate its performance for a lengthy period before purchasing any more of our systems.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The number of additional products a customer purchases, if any, depends on many factors, including the customer s capacity requirements.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The period between a customer s initial purchase and any subsequent purchases can vary from six months to a year or longer, and variations in the length of this period could cause further fluctuations in our operating results and possibly in our stock price.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Most of our revenues have been derived from customers outside of the United States subjecting us to operational, financial and political risks, such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs, political and economic instability, outbreaks of hostilities, and difficulties in managing foreign sales representatives and foreign branch operations as well as risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations Due to the significant level of our international sales, we are subject to a number of material risks, including: Compliance with foreign laws.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our business is subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally, including compliance with, inconsistencies among, and unexpected changes in, a wide variety of foreign laws and regulatory environments with which we are not familiar, including, among other issues, with respect to employees, protection of our intellectual property, and a wide variety of operational regulations and trade and export controls under domestic, foreign, and international law.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including tariffs and other market barriers.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The semiconductor device industry is a high-visibility industry in many of the European and Asian countries in which we sell our products.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Because the governments of these countries have provided extensive financial support to our semiconductor device manufacturing customers in these countries, we believe that our customers could be disproportionately affected by any trade embargoes, excise taxes or other restrictions imposed by their governments on trade with United States companies such as ourselves.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Any restrictions of these types could result in a reduction in our sales to customers in these countries.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We are subject to various global risks related to political and economic instabilities in countries in which we derive sales.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If terrorist activities, armed conflict, civil or military unrest or political instability occurs outside of the U.S., these events may result in reduced demand for our products.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	There is considerable political instability in Taiwan related to its disputes with China and in South Korea related to its disputes with North Korea.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In addition, several Asian countries, particularly Japan, have experienced significant economic instability.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	An outbreak of hostilities or other political upheaval in China, Taiwan or South Korea, or an economic downturn in Japan or other countries, would likely harm the operations of our customers in these countries.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	The effect of these types of events on our revenues and cash flows could be material because we derive substantial revenues from sales to semiconductor device foundries in Taiwan such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd., from memory chip manufacturers in South Korea such as Samsung, and from semiconductor device manufacturers in Japan such as Toshiba.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign branch operations.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	During periods of tension between the governments of the United States and certain other countries, it is often difficult for United States companies such as ourselves to staff and manage operations in such countries.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Language and other cultural differences may also inhibit our sales and marketing efforts and create internal communication problems among our U.S. and foreign research and development teams, increasing the difficulty of managing multiple, remote locations performing various development, quality assurance, and yield ramp analysis projects.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Currency fluctuations as compared to the U.S. Dollar.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	A substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	As a result, if the dollar rises in value in relation to foreign currencies, our systems will become more expensive to customers outside the United States and less competitive with systems produced by competitors outside the United States.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	These conditions could negatively impact our international sales.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Foreign sales also expose us to collection risk in the event it becomes more expensive for our foreign customers to convert their local currencies into U.S. dollars.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Additionally, in the event a larger portion of our revenue becomes denominated in foreign currencies, we would be subject to a potentially significant exchange rate risk.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If we deliver systems with defects, our credibility will be harmed and the sales and market acceptance of our systems will decrease Our systems are complex and have occasionally contained errors, defects and bugs when introduced.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing or general handling, and can have a major impact on device and process quality.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	When this occurs, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our systems could be harmed.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Further, if our systems contain errors, defects or bugs, computer viruses or malicious code as a result of cyber attacks to our computer networks, we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate these problems.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Defects could also lead to product liability as a result of product liability lawsuits against us or against our customers.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We have agreed to indemnify our customers under certain circumstances against liability arising from defects in our systems.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Our product liability policy currently provides $2.0 million of aggregate coverage, with an overall umbrella limit of $14.0 million .
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	In the event of a successful product liability claim, we could be obligated to pay damages significantly in excess of our product liability insurance limits.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If we are not successful in developing new and enhanced products for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry, we will lose sales and market share to our competitors We operate in an industry that is highly competitive and subject to evolving industry standards, rapid technological changes, rapid changes in consumer demands and the rapid introduction of new, higher performance systems with shorter product life cycles.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	To be competitive in our demanding market, we must continually design, develop and introduce in a timely manner new inspection, lithography and film metrology systems that meet the performance and price demands of semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We must also continue to refine our current systems so that they remain competitive.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We expect to continue to make significant investments in our research and development activities.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P16_S4	We may experience difficulties or delays in our development efforts with respect to new systems, and we may not ultimately be successful in our product enhancement efforts to improve and advance products or in responding effectively to technological change, as not all research and development activities result in viable commercial products.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P16_S5	In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to develop new products for the most opportunistic new markets and applications.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Any significant delay in releasing new systems could cause our products to become obsolete, adversely affect our reputation, give a competitor a first-to-market advantage or cause a competitor to achieve greater market share.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P16_S7	In addition, new product offerings that are highly complex in terms of software or hardware may require application or service work such as bug fixing prior to acceptance, thereby delaying revenue recognition.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P16_S8	If new products developed by us do not gain general market acceptance, we will be unable to generate revenues and recover our research and development costs Inspection, lithography and metrology product development is inherently risky because it is difficult to foresee developments in semiconductor device manufacturing technology, coordinate technical personnel, and identify and eliminate system design flaws.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P16_S9	Further, our products are complex and often the applications to our customers businesses are unique.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P16_S10	Any new systems we introduce may not achieve or sustain a significant degree of market acceptance and sales.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P16_S11	We expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources developing new systems and refining our existing systems.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P16_S12	In light of the long product development cycles inherent in our industry, these expenditures will be made well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenue from the sale of those systems.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P16_S13	Our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market new systems are subject to a wide variety of challenges during the development cycle, including start-up bugs, design defects, and other matters that could delay introduction of these systems.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P16_S14	In addition, since our customers are not obligated by long-term contracts to purchase our systems, our anticipated product orders may not materialize, or orders that are placed may be canceled.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P16_S15	As a result, if we do not achieve market acceptance of new products, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows to recover our research and development costs and our market share, revenue, operating results or stock price would be negatively impacted.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Even if we are able to develop new products that gain market acceptance, sales of these new products could impair our ability to sell existing products Competition from our new systems could have a negative effect on sales of our existing systems and the prices that we could charge for these systems.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We may also divert sales and marketing resources from our current systems in order to successfully launch and promote our new or next generation systems.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	This diversion of resources could have a further negative effect on sales of our current systems and the value of inventory.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If our relationships with our large customers deteriorate, our product development activities could be adversely affected The success of our product development efforts depends on our ability to anticipate market trends and the price, performance and functionality requirements of semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In order to anticipate these trends and ensure that critical development projects proceed in a coordinated manner, we must continue to collaborate closely with our largest customers.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Our relationships with these and other customers provide us with access to valuable information regarding trends in the semiconductor device industry, which enables us to better plan our product development activities.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S6	If our current relationships with our large customers are impaired, or if we are unable to develop similar collaborative relationships with important customers in the future, our product development activities could be adversely affected.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S7	Our ability to reduce costs is limited by our ongoing need to invest in research and development and to provide customer support activities Our industry is characterized by the need for continual investment in research and development as well as customer service and support.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S8	As a result, our operating results could be materially affected if operating costs associated with our research and development as well as customer support activities increase in the future or we are unable to reduce those activities.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S9	We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property and, therefore, lose our competitive advantage Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology for our principal product families, and we rely, in part, on patent and trade secret law and confidentiality agreements to protect that technology.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S10	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it will give our competitors a significant advantage.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S11	We own or have licensed a number of patents relating to our transparent and opaque thin film metrology, lithography and macro-defect inspection systems, and have filed applications for additional patents.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S12	Any of our pending patent applications may be rejected, and we may be unable to develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable in the future.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S13	In addition, the patents that we do own or that have been issued or licensed to us may not provide us with competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S14	Further, third parties may also design around these patents.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In addition to patent protection, we rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and technology.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and other third parties.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Even though these agreements are in place there can be no assurances that trade secrets and proprietary information will not be disclosed, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, or that we can fully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Violations by others of our confidentiality agreements and the loss of employees who have specialized knowledge and expertise could harm our competitive position and cause our sales and operating results to decline as a result of increased competition.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Costly and time-consuming litigation might be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection might adversely affect our ability to continue our research or bring products to market.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Protection of our intellectual property rights, or the efforts of third parties to enforce their own intellectual property rights against us, may result in costly and time-consuming litigation, substantial damages, lost product sales and/or the loss of important intellectual property rights We may be required to initiate litigation in order to enforce any patents issued to or licensed by us, or to determine the scope or validity of a third party s patent or other proprietary rights.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Any litigation, regardless of outcome, could be expensive and time consuming, and could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to re-engineer our products or obtain expensive licenses from third parties.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In addition, our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P19_S4	From time to time, we may receive communications from third parties asserting that our products or systems infringe, or may infringe, the proprietary rights of these third parties.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P19_S5	These claims of infringement may lead to protracted and costly litigation, which could require us to pay substantial damages or have the sale of our products or systems stopped by an injunction.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Infringement claims could also cause product or system delays or require us to redesign our products or systems, and these delays could result in the loss of substantial revenues.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P19_S7	We may also be required to obtain a license from the third party or cease activities utilizing the third party s proprietary rights.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P19_S8	We may not be able to enter into such a license or such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P19_S9	Accordingly, the loss of important intellectual property rights could hinder our ability to sell our systems, or make the sale of these systems more expensive.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P19_S10	For additional information regarding recent patent litigation, see Item 3.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in certain foreign countries, where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the United States The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement abroad.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	For example, Taiwan is not a signatory of the Patent Cooperation Treaty, which is designed to specify rules and methods for defending intellectual property internationally.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The publication of a patent in Taiwan prior to the filing of a patent in Taiwan would invalidate the ability of a company to obtain a patent in Taiwan.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Similarly, in contrast to the United States where the contents of patents remain confidential during the patent application process, in Taiwan the contents of a patent are published upon filing which provides competitors an advance view of the contents of a patent application prior to the establishment of patent rights.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Consequently, there is a risk that we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights in certain foreign countries.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P20_S5	If this occurs, it would be easier for our competitors to develop and sell competing products in these countries.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Some of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, and increased competition could impair sales of our products or cause us to reduce our prices The market for semiconductor capital equipment is highly competitive.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P20_S7	We face substantial competition from established companies in each of the markets we serve.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P20_S8	We principally compete with KLA-Tencor, Camtek and Ultratech.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P20_S9	We compete to a lesser extent with companies such as Nanometrics and Nikon.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P20_S10	Each of our products also competes with products that use different metrology, inspection or lithography techniques.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P20_S11	Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, broader product offerings and service capabilities and larger installed customer bases than we do.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P20_S12	As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or market developments by devoting greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products, which, in turn, could impair sales of our products.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P20_S13	Further, there may be significant merger and acquisition activity among our competitors and potential competitors, which, in turn, may provide them with a competitive advantage over us by enabling them to rapidly expand their product offerings and service capabilities to meet a broader range of customer needs.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Many of our customers and potential customers in the semiconductor device manufacturing industry are large companies that require global support and service for their semiconductor capital equipment.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We believe that our global support and service infrastructure is sufficient to meet the needs of our customers and potential customers.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	competing for the business of global semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Many of our competitors are investing heavily in the development of new systems that will compete directly with our systems.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We have from time to time selectively reduced prices on our systems in order to protect our market share, and competitive pressures may necessitate further price reductions.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	We expect our competitors in each product area to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices and performance characteristics.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P22_S4	These product introductions would likely require us to decrease the prices of our systems and increase the level of discounts that we grant our customers.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Price reductions or lost sales as a result of these competitive pressures would reduce our total revenues and could adversely impact our financial results.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We believe that once a semiconductor device manufacturer has selected one vendor s capital equipment for a production-line application, the manufacturer generally relies upon that capital equipment and, to the extent possible, subsequent generations of the same vendor s equipment, for the life of the application.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Once a vendor s equipment has been installed in a production line application, a semiconductor device manufacturer must often make substantial technical modifications and may experience production-line downtime in order to switch to another vendor s equipment.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Accordingly, unless our systems offer performance or cost advantages that outweigh a customer s expense of switching to our systems, it will be difficult for us to achieve significant sales to that manufacturer once it has selected another vendor s capital equipment for an application.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key executive management, engineering, sales and marketing, customer support, finance and manufacturing personnel.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P23_S4	The loss of any of these key personnel through resignations, retirement or other circumstances, each of whom would be extremely difficult to replace, could harm our business and operating results.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Although we have employment and noncompetition agreements with key members of our senior management team, these individuals or other key employees may still leave us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P23_S6	We do not have key person life insurance on any of our executives.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P23_S7	In addition, to support our future growth, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P23_S8	Competition for such personnel in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified employees.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P23_S9	We obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a limited group of suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenues We obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a limited group of suppliers and do not have long-term contracts with many of our suppliers.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P23_S10	Our dependence on limited source suppliers of components and our lack of long-term contracts with many of our suppliers exposes us to several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components, price increases, late deliveries and poor component quality.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P23_S11	Disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our systems, damage our customer relationships and reduce our sales.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	From time to time in the past, we have experienced temporary difficulties in receiving shipments from our suppliers.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The lead-time required for shipments of some of our components can be as long as six months.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In addition, the lead time required to qualify new suppliers for lasers could be as long as a year, and the lead time required to qualify new suppliers of other components could be as long as nine months.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	If we are unable to accurately predict our component needs, or if our component supply is disrupted, we may miss market opportunities by not being able to meet the demand for our systems.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Further, a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components or subassemblies could seriously harm our results of operations and cash flows.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility could have a material adverse effect on our revenues Our manufacturing processes are highly complex and require sophisticated and costly equipment and a specially designed facility.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	As a result, any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, or destruction of or damage as a result of a fire or any other reason, could seriously harm our ability to satisfy our customer order deadlines.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	If we cannot timely deliver our systems, our results from operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Cybersecurity attacks could include, but are not limited to, malicious software, viruses, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and the unauthorized release, corruption or loss of our data, loss of our intellectual property, theft of our proprietary or licensed technology, loss or damage to our data delivery systems, other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in our critical systems, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S5	It is possible that our business, financial and other systems could be compromised, which might not be noticed for some period of time.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks are evolving and unpredictable and we cannot guarantee that any risk prevention measures implemented will be successful.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S7	The occurrence of such an attack could lead to financial losses and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S8	Our earnings could be negatively affected and our inventory levels could materially increase if we are unable to predict our inventory needs in an accurate and timely manner and adjust our orders for parts and subcomponents should our needs increase or decrease materially due to unexpected increases or decreases in demand for our products.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S9	Any material increase in our inventories could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, while any material decrease in our ability to procure needed inventories could result in an inability to supply customer demand for our products, thus adversely affecting our revenues.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S10	Our ability to fulfill our backlog may have an effect on our long term ability to procure contracts and fulfill current contracts Our ability to fulfill our backlog may be limited by our ability to devote sufficient financial and human capital resources and limited by available material supplies.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S11	If we do not fulfill our backlog in a timely manner, we may experience delays in product delivery which would postpone receipt of revenue from those delayed deliveries.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S12	Additionally, if we are consistently unable to fulfill our backlog, this may be a disincentive to customers to award large contracts to us in the future until they are comfortable that we can effectively manage our backlog.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S13	We may choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves, and may be unable to complete these acquisitions or may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired business in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner Our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S14	To this end, we have, from time to time, engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions, and from time to time acquiring one or more businesses, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S15	We may choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products, technologies and/or services instead of developing them ourselves.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S16	We may, however, face competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established companies with greater financial resources, making it more difficult for us to complete acquisitions.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S17	We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from one or more acquisitions that we consummate.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	could be expensive and time-consuming and/or disrupt our ongoing business.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Further, there are numerous risks associated with acquisitions and potential acquisitions, including but not limited to:
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	unexpected reduction of sales of existing products by new products.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such favorable terms or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations, including as a result of our incurrence of indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	In order to finance any acquisitions, we might need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	In that event, we could be forced to obtain financing on terms that are not favorable to us and, in the case of equity financing, that result in dilution to our stockholders.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	In addition, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, amortization of intangible assets, write-down of other assets or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions and purchase accounting could harm our business and operating results.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P29_S3	If we cannot effectively manage growth, our business may suffer Over the long-term, we intend to grow our business by increasing our sales efforts and completing strategic acquisitions.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P29_S4	To effectively manage growth, we must, among other things:
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	administer appropriate financial and administrative control procedures.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Growth of our business will likely place a significant strain on our management, financial, operational, technical, sales and administrative resources.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Any failure to effectively manage our growth may cause our business to suffer and our stock price to decline.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Changes in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect results As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Our future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the (1) applicable tax laws; (2) composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates; or (3) recoverability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P32_S3	In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P32_S4	We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Turmoil or fluctuations in the credit markets and the financial services industry may negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity During recent years, global credit markets and the financial services industry have experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by tightening of the credit markets, weakening of the global economy and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States and other governments.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Adverse economic conditions, such as sustained periods of economic uncertainty or a crisis in the financial markets may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition if our ability to obtain credit from the capital financial markets or from trade creditors were to be impaired.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	In addition, a worsening economy or an economic crisis could also adversely impact our customers ability to finance the purchase of systems from us or our suppliers ability to provide us with product, either of which may negatively impact our business and results of operations.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations As a result of our sale of $60.0 million of 3.75% convertible senior notes on July 25, 2011 (the Notes ), we now have long-term debt.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Our maintenance of indebtedness could have important consequences because:
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our ability to generate sufficient cash to pay our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash to pay our debt obligations, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of our debt obligations, seek to refinance all or a portion of our debt obligations or obtain additional financing.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P36_S3	There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Failure to make a payment on our debt obligations, or to fail to satisfy one or more covenants under our debt agreements, could also result in acceleration of all of our debt obligations, including the Notes, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P36_S5	We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or to repurchase the Notes Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture that governs the Notes), subject to certain conditions, holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P36_S6	In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, we will be required to make cash payments of up to $1,000 for each $1,000 in principal amount of Notes converted.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P36_S7	However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered for repurchase upon a fundamental change or to make cash payments in respect of Notes that are being converted.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P36_S8	In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P36_S9	Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P36_S10	A default under the indenture or a fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing any future indebtedness.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P36_S11	If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions of the Notes.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	New regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers On August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	These regulations require companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	The first such report was filed with the SEC on May 29, 2014.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P37_S3	The implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, including our products.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P37_S4	In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P37_S5	Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P37_S6	In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our operating results are subject to significant variation due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor device industry.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor device manufacturers, which, in turn, depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	In recent years, the industry has experienced significant downturns, generally in connection with declines in economic conditions.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	This cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and, thus, future expense levels.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P40_S3	During a down cycle, we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P40_S4	In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P40_S5	We can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P40_S6	If we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business could be seriously harmed.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P40_S7	Our future rate of growth is highly dependent on the development and growth of the market for microelectronic device inspection, lithography and metrology equipment We target our products to address the needs of microelectronic device manufacturers for defect inspection, metrology and lithography.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P40_S8	If for any reason the market for microelectronic device inspection, lithography or metrology equipment fails to grow in the long term, we may be unable to maintain current revenue levels in the short term and maintain our historical growth in the long term.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Growth in the inspection market is dependent to a large extent upon microelectronic manufacturers replacing manual inspection with automated inspection technology.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Growth in the metrology market is dependent to a large extent upon new chip designs and capacity expansion of microelectronic manufacturers.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	There is no assurance that manufacturers will undertake these actions at the rate we expect.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Risks Related to our Stock Provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law, as well as our stockholder rights plan, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and/or delay, deter or prevent a change in control of our company Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as our stockholder rights plan, may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board of Directors.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	These provisions also limit the circumstances in which a premium can be paid for the common stock, and in which a proxy contest for control of our board may be initiated.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	the authority of our board, without stockholder approval, to adopt a Stockholder Rights Plan.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Such a Shareholder Rights Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on June 27, 2005 .
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We are also entitled to avail ourselves of the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could inhibit changes in control of us.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our stock price is volatile The market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	From the beginning of fiscal year 2009 through the end of fiscal year 2014 , our stock price fluctuated between a high of $14.10 per share and a low of $1.95 per share.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Factors affecting our stock price may include:
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	the number of firms making a market in our common stock.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	In addition, the stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P45_S2	These fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high technology companies like ours.
1094392_15_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Any such market fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1094392_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our executive office building is located at One Rudolph Road in Flanders, New Jersey.
1094392_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own and lease facilities for engineering, manufacturing, sales and service related purposes in the United States and seven other countries China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Scotland.
1094392_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	The following table indicates the location, the general purpose and the square footage of our principal facilities.
1094392_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	The expiration years of the leases covering the leased facilities are also indicated.
1094392_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	We also lease office space for other smaller sales and service offices in several locations throughout the world.
1094392_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our existing facilities and capital equipment are adequate to meet our current requirements, and that suitable additional or substitute space is available on commercially reasonable terms if needed.
1094392_15_ITEM2_P1_S2	On November 14, 2014, we announced the closing of our facility in Mainz, Germany and will relocate the operations to our facilities in Snoqualmie, Washington and Bloomington, Minnesota with a target completion date of March 31, 2015.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P1_S0	As previously disclosed, in December 2007 , we completed the acquisition of specific assets and liabilities of the semiconductor division of Applied Precision LLC ( Applied ).
1094392_15_ITEM3_P1_S1	As a result of the acquisition, we assumed certain liabilities of Applied including a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court, District of Arizona, by Integrated Technology Corporation ( ITC ) which alleged Applied s PrecisionPoint , PrecisionWoRx and ProbeWoRx products infringed an ITC patent (Integrated Technology Corporation v. Rudolph Technologies, Inc., No. CV-06-2182-PHX-ROS).
1094392_15_ITEM3_P1_S2	Prior to trial, the District Court ruled that such products sold prior to August of 2007 (the pre-August 2007 tools ) infringed the ITC patent.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P1_S3	At trial in December of 2011 , a trial verdict was rendered in which the jury found that while our products manufactured after August of 2007 (the post- August 2007 tools ) did not literally infringe ITC s patent, the products were found to infringe under a rule known as the doctrine of equivalents, a legal principle which expands the language of patent claims to encompass products or processes which may otherwise be found not to literally infringe the patent.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P1_S4	The jury awarded $15.5 million to ITC in damages for sales made during the years 2000-2011 , of which approximately one-half related to sales for pre- August 2007 tools.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P1_S5	August 2007 tools, the infringement was willful.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P1_S6	On July 23, 2012 , the District Court issued an Order which affirmed the jury s award, applied treble damages to the portion of the jury award related to post- August 2007 tool sales and granted ITC s motion for attorney s fees and prejudgment interest on the verdict and attorney s fees.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P1_S7	At that time, the District Court also enjoined us from future infringement of the ITC patent and from selling or supplying the applicable products with the applicable features from or into the United States.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P1_S8	We appealed the injunction, the District Court Order and the damages assessment.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P1_S9	In October 2012 , the injunction was stayed by the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals and thereafter in June of 2013 , the patent expired.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P1_S10	On November 4, 2013 , the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals issued a ruling which reversed the judgment of infringement against all post- August 2007 tools, reversed the finding of willfulness, vacated the treble damages award, vacated the award of attorney s fees and costs, remanded the issue back to the District Court for further review, and affirmed the award of damages and interest for the pre- August 2007 tools.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P2_S0	With regard to the damages assessment against the pre- August 2007 tools, on March 4, 2014 , we filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court to appeal the basis of the Federal Court of Appeals decision affirming the damages award for the pre- August 2007 tools.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P2_S1	On June 30, 2014 , the Supreme Court denied our Petition and as a result, we increased our related litigation accrual by $9.6 million for a total accrual of $13.9 million .
1094392_15_ITEM3_P2_S2	On July 22, 2014 , we then paid to ITC $10.6 million which represented only the damages and interest portion of the judgment.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P2_S3	Since the patent expired in June of 2013 and payment of the judgment has been made, this matter is fully resolved with the sole exception of the issue of the remanded attorney s fees.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P2_S4	On August 8, 2014 , the District Court issued an order for setting the attorney s fees award at $3.3 million which we appealed to the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals on September 5, 2014 .
1094392_15_ITEM3_P2_S5	We believe that we have meritorious defenses regarding this issue and intend to continue to vigorously prosecute the matter.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P3_S0	The $3.3 million is held in escrow and is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P3_S1	The corresponding liability is recorded under the caption, Other current liabilities, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P3_S2	We expect this to be the maximum liability reasonably possible for the attorney s fees, excluding interest, for this lawsuit with respect to both the pre- August 2007 and post- 2007 August tools.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P4_S0	In our patent infringement suit against Camtek, Ltd., of Migdal Hamek, Israel, concerning our proprietary continuous scan wafer inspection technology, the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals issued a ruling on August 22, 2011 .
1094392_15_ITEM3_P4_S1	In its opinion, the Appellate Court affirmed multiple rulings from trial at the District Court level including (i) finding our U.S.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P4_S2	Patent No. 6,826,298 valid, (ii) the part of the infringement ruling based on the finding that Camtek s Falcon product strobes based on velocity, and (iii) the dismissal of Camtek s claim against us for inequitable conduct against the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P4_S3	The court did, however, revise one claim construction ruling made by the District Court in the original case.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P4_S4	As a result, the Appellate Court set aside the verdict delivered by the jury for damages and the District Court s decision to enter an injunction against Camtek s selling Falcon tools in the U.S. and remanded the case back to the trial court for a limited trial on this single infringement issue.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P4_S5	On March 31, 2014 , the District Court ruled in our favor, finding that Camtek s Falcon tools continue to infringe our patent even under the revised claim construction of the patent, obviating the need for the limited trial.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P4_S6	On February 9, 2015, the District Court issued an Order granting our Motion for Final Judgment, reinstating the original damages and applying prejudgment interest for a total award of $14.5 million.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P5_S0	thereof in the United States, intended for sale and use within the United States, until the expiration of the 6,298 patent [projected to be in 2020].
1094392_15_ITEM3_P5_S1	Camtek has 30 days in which to appeal the decision should they so choose.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P6_S0	This lawsuit was initially brought in 2005 by August Technology prior to its merger with us.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P6_S1	We have subsequently filed a lawsuit against Camtek alleging infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 7,729,528, also related to our proprietary continuous scan wafer inspection technology.
1094392_15_ITEM3_P6_S2	This lawsuit is currently stayed pending resolution of a re-examination petition filed by Camtek with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

1094392_15_ITEM5_P1_S2	Stockholder returns over the indicated period should not be considered indicative of future stockholder returns.
1094392_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	On December 16, 2013, we transferred the listing of our Common Stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market to the NYSE.
1094392_15_ITEM5_P2_S1	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sale prices per share of our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market through December 20, 2013 and on the NYSE thereafter.
1094392_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	As of February 6, 2015 , there were 70 stockholders of record of our common stock and approximately 6,557 beneficial stockholders.
1094392_15_ITEM5_P3_S1	The closing market value of our common stock on February 6, 2015 was $12.09 per share.
1094392_15_ITEM5_P3_S2	We have never declared or paid a cash dividend on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1094392_15_ITEM5_P3_S3	We currently intend to retain our earnings, if any, for the development of our business and the share repurchase of our common stock.
1094392_15_ITEM5_P3_S4	Additionally, covenants in the indenture governing the Notes restrict our ability to declare or pay cash dividends.
1094392_15_ITEM5_P3_S5	The declaration of any future dividends by us is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements as well as any other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
1094392_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	In July 2008 , our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to 3.0 million shares of our common stock with no established end date.
1094392_15_ITEM5_P4_S1	The authorization allows for repurchases to be made in the open market or through negotiated transactions from time to time.
1094392_15_ITEM5_P4_S2	At December 31, 2014 , there were 1.6 million shares available for future stock repurchases under this repurchase authorization.
1094392_15_ITEM5_P4_S3	The shares of common stock purchased under the share repurchase authorization are being retired.
1094392_15_ITEM5_P4_S4	In January 2015, our Board of Directors approved an additional 1.4 million shares to the existing repurchase plan, bringing the total current authorization back to 3.0 million shares .

1094392_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1094392_15_ITEM6_P1_S1	The balance sheet data as of December 31, 2013 and 2014 and the statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2013 and 2014 set forth below were derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1094392_15_ITEM6_P1_S2	The balance sheet data as of 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , and the statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011 were derived from our audited consolidated financial statements not included herein.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview We are a worldwide leader in the design, development, manufacture and support of high-performance control metrology, defect inspection, advanced packaging lithography, thin film metrology, and data analysis systems and software used by microelectronic device manufacturers.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	We provide process and yield management solutions used in both wafer processing and final manufacturing through a family of standalone systems for macro-defect inspection, lithography, probe card test and analysis, and transparent and opaque thin film measurements.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	All Rudolph systems feature sophisticated software and production-worthy automation.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P0_S3	Rudolph systems are backed by worldwide customer support.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	In April 2013 , we announced that we had acquired specific assets of Tamar Technology, located in Newbury Park, California ( Tamar acquisition ).
1094392_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	The acquired business has been integrated into our inspection technology group.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	The impact of the acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	Rudolph s business is affected by the annual spending patterns of our customers on semiconductor capital equipment.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	The amount that our customers devote to capital equipment spending depends on a number of factors, including general worldwide economic conditions as well as other economic drivers such as personal computer, tablet, cell phone, other personal electronic devices and automotive sales.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P2_S3	Current forecasts by industry analysts for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry project a year-over-year increase in capital spending of approximately 5% to 10% for 2015.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our revenues and profitability, tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	We monitor capital equipment spending through announced capital spending plans by our customers and monthly-published industry data such as the book-to-bill ratio.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	The book-to-bill ratio is a 3-month running statistic that compares bookings or orders placed with capital equipment suppliers to billings or shipments.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P3_S3	A book-to-bill ratio above 1.0 shows that semiconductor device equipment manufacturers are ordering equipment at a pace that exceeds the equipment suppliers shipments for the period.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P3_S4	The three month rolling average North American semiconductor equipment book-to-bill ratio was 1.0 for the month of December 2014 , increasing from the September 2014 book-to-bill ratio of 0.9 .
1094392_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Historically, a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers, and we expect this trend to continue.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2013 and 2014 , sales to customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for 50.9% , 41.6% , and 23.9% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	We do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products, and they could cease purchasing products from us at any time.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	A delay in purchase or cancellation by any of our large customers could cause quarterly revenues to vary significantly.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	In addition, during a given quarter, a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P5_S3	The following table presents the average selling price range for our systems in 2014.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	A significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customers outside of the United States.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	A substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in U.S dollars.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	We expect that revenues generated from customers outside of the United States will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P6_S3	The sales cycle for our systems typically ranges from six to twenty-four months, and can be longer when our customers are evaluating new technology.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P6_S4	Due to the length of these cycles, we invest significantly in research and development and sales and marketing in advance of generating revenues related to these investments.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our statements of operations data as percentages of our revenues.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our results of operations are reported as one business segment.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	Results of Operations 2012 , 2013 and 2014 Revenues.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	Our revenues are derived from the sale of our systems, services, spare parts and software licensing.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	Our revenues were $218.5 million , $176.2 million and $181.2 million for the years ended 2012 , 2013 and 2014 , respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P8_S3	This represents a decrease of 19.3% from 2012 to 2013 and an increase of 2.8% from 2013 to 2014 .
1094392_15_ITEM7_P8_S4	The decrease in revenue from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to decreased capital spending in the front-end semiconductor manufacturers, principally by our foundry customers and advanced packaging industry.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P8_S5	The increase in revenue from, 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to increased capital spending by back-end semiconductor manufacturers, principally by our advanced packaging customers.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P8_S6	The following table lists, for the periods indicated, the different sources of our revenues in dollars (thousands) and as percentages of our total revenues:
1094392_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Total systems and software revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 due to a decrease in demand for our products in advanced packaging and front-end systems.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	This contributed to a decrease in the number of inspection systems sold year-over-year and reflected a decrease in inspection systems revenue of $39.8 million .
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	The year-over-year decreases in metrology systems revenue of $11.5 million and data analysis and review software revenues of $1.9 million from 2012 to 2013 were primarily due to decreased sales across all metrology product families and decreased licensing revenue from the data analysis and review software product category.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	The year-over-year increase in lithography systems revenue from 2012 to 2013 of $8.5 million was due to our entrance into the lithography market.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S3	The average selling price of similarly configured systems has been consistent and therefore did not have a material impact on our revenue for the same period.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S4	Systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to 67% of total revenue for 2012 compared to 64% of total revenue for 2013 .
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S5	The year-over-year increase in parts and service revenues in absolute dollars from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to increased spending by our customers on repairs of existing systems.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S6	Parts and services revenues are generated from part sales, maintenance service contracts, system upgrades, as well as time and material billable service calls.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S7	Total systems and software revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 due to an increase in licensing and lithography revenue.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S8	There was a year-over-year increase in lithography revenue of $2.6 million , however, the number of units sold decreased slightly.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S9	Licensing revenue from the data analysis and review software product category increased $6.1 million primarily in increased licensing revenue from our process control software.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S10	The year-over-year increase in system and software revenue was partially offset by a decrease in inspection systems revenue of $1.3 million , however, there was a slight increase in the number of inspection units sold.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S11	There was a decrease in metrology revenue of $1.9 million due to a decrease in demand for metrology systems.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S12	Systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to 64% of total revenue for 2013 compared to 61% of total revenue for 2014 .
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S13	The year-over-year increase in parts and service revenues in absolute dollars from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to increased spending by our customers on repairs of existing systems.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S14	Parts and services revenues are generated from part sales, maintenance service contracts, system upgrades, as well as time and material billable service calls.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S15	Deferred revenues of $8.0 million were recorded in Other current liabilities at December 31, 2014 and primarily consisted of $5.5 million for deferred maintenance agreements and $2.5 million for outstanding deliverables.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S16	Our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including manufacturing efficiencies, excess and obsolete inventory write-offs, pricing by competitors or suppliers, new product introductions, production volume, customization and reconfiguration of systems, international and domestic sales mix, and parts and service margins.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S17	Our gross profit was $115.7 million , $90.7 million and $95.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2013 and 2014 , respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S18	The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to lower volume of system and software sales as well as product mix.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S19	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to higher volume of software sales as well as product mix.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P10_S20	Operating Expenses Our operating expenses consist of:
1094392_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	The macro-defect inspection, thin film transparent, opaque process control, and probe card test analysis market is characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	We believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements of existing products, including the transition to copper and low-k dielectrics, wafer level packaging, the continuous shrinkage in critical dimensions, and the evolution of ultra-thin gate process control, is critical to our success.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our technical, management and financial resources to research and development programs.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	Research and development expenditures consist primarily of salaries and related expenses of employees engaged in research, design and development activities.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P11_S4	They also include consulting fees, the cost of related supplies and legal costs to defend our patents.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P11_S5	Our research and development expense was $39.3 million , $40.0 million and $40.6 million in 2012 , 2013 and 2014 , respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P11_S6	The year-over-year dollar increase from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to higher compensation and project costs, as well as, additional research and development costs for acquired businesses in the latter part of 2012 and in 2013 .
1094392_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	We continue to maintain our commitment to investing in new product development and enhancement to existing products.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs for sales, marketing, and general administrative personnel, as well as commissions and other non-personnel related expenses.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	Our selling, general and administrative expense was $40.2 million , $41.5 million and $53.8 million in 2012 , 2013 and 2014 , respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	The year-over-year increase from 2012 to 2013 in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily due to the inclusion of selling, general and administrative expenses for acquired businesses in 2012 and 2013 .
1094392_15_ITEM7_P13_S3	The year-over-year increase from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to increased litigation expenses related to the final judgment awarded to Integrated Technology Corporation ( ITC ), higher share based compensation expenses and restructuring charges.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P13_S4	For more information on the ITC litigation, See Part I Item 3 of this Form 10-K. Interest expense,net .
1094392_15_ITEM7_P13_S5	In 2012 , 2013 and 2014 , net interest expense was $4.4 million , $5.1 million and $5.3 million , respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P13_S6	The year-over-year increase in net interest expense from 2012 to 2014 was primarily due to increased amortization of the interest discount related to the convertible senior notes.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P13_S7	The following table provides details of income tax (dollars in millions):
1094392_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	The income tax benefit differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 35% in 2012, primarily as a result of reversal of valuation allowances, partially offset by taxes accrued in foreign jurisdictions.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	The income tax benefit differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 35% for 2013, primarily from research and development tax credits which were not available in 2012 as a result of legislation, foreign tax credits, and the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits, offset by $1.3 million of expense related to a correction of prior year income tax balances recognized in the fourth quarter of 2013.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	The correction of the prior year income tax balance was not considered material to the prior year or current year financial statements.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	The income tax benefit differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 35% for 2014, primarily due to an increase in our valuation allowance and taxes accrued in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by research and development tax credits.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	As discussed in Part I, Item 3.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	Legal Proceedings , we are subject to legal proceedings and claims, which include, among other things, our on-going litigation with ITC in a patent infringement action related to the predictive scrub feature of our PrecisionPoint , PrecisionWoRx and ProbeWoRx products in which we were the defendants.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	See Part I, Item 3 for a discussion of this action and the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals ruling reversing the finding of infringement against products sold after August of 2007 and its order of other relief in this matter.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P16_S3	The U.S. Federal Court of Appeals did affirm the jury s finding of damages against us related to products sold prior to August of 2007 for which we ultimately paid $10.6 million to ITC to satisfy the damages award.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P16_S4	The District Court subsequently issued an order awarding ITC $3.3 million in attorney s fees which we are in the process of pursuing an appeal.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P16_S5	In an adverse judgment against us in this matter, the amount identified by the Court will not have a material impact on our results of operations and will also not have a material impact on our liquidity and financial condition.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2013 , our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $167.4 million , while working capital amounted to $265.3 million .
1094392_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	At December 31, 2014 , we had $157.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $254.5 million in working capital.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Typically during periods of revenue growth, changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a use of cash as we incur costs and expend cash in advance of receiving cash from our customers.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	Similarly, during periods of declining revenue, changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a source of cash as inventory purchases decline and revenue from prior periods is collected.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	Net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2013 and 2014 totaled $22.1 million , $6.1 million and $4.3 million , respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2012 , cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, of $39.4 million , and an increase in deferred revenue of $3.6 million , a decrease in income taxes of $3.5 million , and an increase in other liabilities of $1.0 million , partially offset by an increase accounts receivable of $14.7 million , an increase in inventory of $6.7 million and an decrease in accounts payable of $2.7 million , and an increase in prepaid and other assets of $1.4 million .
1094392_15_ITEM7_P18_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, of $19.8 million , a decrease in account receivable of $2.6 million , and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.4 million , partially offset by an increase in inventory of $6.8 million , a decrease in other liabilities of $3.0 million , an increase in income taxes of $4.6 million , a decrease in deferred revenue of $2.4 million , and a decrease in accounts payable of $0.9 million .
1094392_15_ITEM7_P18_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2014 , cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net loss, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, of $12.4 million , an increase in accounts payable of $3.8 million , a decrease in income tax receivable of $1.2 million , a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.1 million , and an increase in other liabilities of $0.6 million , partially offset by an increase in inventories of $9.4 million , an increase in prepaid expenses and other of $4.7 million , and a decrease in deferred revenue of $0.8 million .
1094392_15_ITEM7_P18_S6	Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2013 and 2014 totaled $14.9 million , $30.0 million and $28.5 million , respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P18_S7	During the year ended December 31, 2012 , net cash used by investing activities included purchases of marketable securities of $96.3 million , acquisition costs for business combinations of $18.6 million , and capital expenditures of $2.4 million , which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $102.4 million .
1094392_15_ITEM7_P18_S8	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , net cash used by investing activities included purchases of marketable securities of $119.1 million , capital expenditures of $4.9 million , and acquisition costs for business combinations of $3.4 million , which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $97.3 million .
1094392_15_ITEM7_P18_S9	During the year ended December 31, 2014 , net cash used by investing activities included purchases of marketable securities of $243.7 million , and capital expenditures of $2.1 million , which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $217.2 million .
1094392_15_ITEM7_P18_S10	Capital expenditures over the next twelve months are expected to be approximately $6.0 million to $8.0 million .
1094392_15_ITEM7_P18_S11	Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $0.5 million , $1.4 million and $(12.7) million in 2012 , 2013 and 2014 , respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P18_S12	In the 2012 and 2013 periods, net cash provided by financing activities comprised proceeds received from sales of shares through share-based compensation plans and tax benefit from share-based compensation plans.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P18_S13	In 2014 , financing activities included the purchase of shares under the share repurchase authorization of $12.8 million and net proceeds from other financing activities.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	From time to time we evaluate whether to acquire new or complementary businesses, products and/or technologies.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	We may fund all or a portion of the purchase price of these acquisitions in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	In July 2008 , our Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 3.0 million shares of our common stock with no established end date.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	The authorization allows for repurchases to be made in the open market or through negotiated transactions from time to time.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P19_S4	At December 31, 2014 , 1.6 million shares remained available for future stock repurchases under this repurchase authorization.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P19_S5	The shares of common stock purchased under the share repurchase authorization are being retired.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	million shares to the existing repurchase authorization, bringing the total current authorization back to 3.0 million shares .
1094392_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	For further information, see Note 18 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	We had a $40 million irrevocable standby letter of credit available with Credit Suisse AG which was required to secure the damages assessment in connection with the ITC Litigation discussed in Legal Proceedings.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	On July 22, 2014, we paid $10.6 million to ITC through a draw down of the letter of credit.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Pursuant to the terms of the letter of credit, upon draw down of the funds, the letter of credit was collateralized by securities held in the Company s investment portfolios which were immediately sold to satisfy the letter of credit payment.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	The letter of credit was subsequently canceled upon completion of this payment.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	On July 25, 2011, we issued $60,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2016 (the Notes ) at par.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	The Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year at an annual rate of 3.75% and will mature on July 15, 2016, unless earlier converted or repurchased.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	The Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, based on an initial conversion rate of 77.241 shares of Company common stock per $1 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $12.95 per share.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we purchased a convertible note hedge for $14,507 and sold a warrant for $7,007.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	The separate convertible note hedge and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the Notes.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and amount of our revenues and our investment decisions, which will affect our ability to generate additional cash.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs for the next twelve months.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	Thereafter, if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements, we may seek additional funding through bank borrowings, sales of securities or other means.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P24_S3	There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us or at all.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2014 , and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	This table excludes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits that totaled approximately $5.3 million at December 31, 2014 .
1094392_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	We are currently unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount or periods when cash settlement of this liability may occur.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	The Company does not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity and capital resources.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Critical Accounting Policies Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	We review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P27_S3	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, business acquisitions, intangible assets, share-based payments, income taxes and warranty obligations.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P27_S4	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P27_S5	Results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P27_S6	These estimates and judgments are regularly reviewed by management and the Audit Committee on an ongoing basis at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P27_S7	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Revenue is recognized provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	Revenue recognition generally results at the following points: (1) for all transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment for all products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment; the portion of revenue associated with certain installation-related tasks is deferred, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation-related tasks; (2) for products that have not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized at customer technical acceptance; (3) for transactions with multiple elements, such as sales of products that include software and services, the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred using the relative selling price method utilizing vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) or estimated sales prices ( ESP ) until delivery of the deferred elements.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	Third-party evidence is not typically used to determine selling prices as to limited availability of reliable competitor products selling prices.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	The ESP is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, gross margin objectives, internal costs and competitor pricing strategies.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Revenues from parts sales are recognized at the time of shipment.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	Revenue from training and service contracts is recognized ratably over the training period and contract period.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	A provision for the estimated cost of fulfilling warranty obligations is recorded at the time the related revenue is recognized.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P31_S3	Revenue from software license fees is recognized upon shipment or customer acknowledgment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and VSOE exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P31_S4	License support and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P31_S5	Deferred revenue represents undelivered items, prepaid service contract revenue and prepaid license support and maintenance revenue.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P31_S6	Deferred revenue is recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policies described above.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	We specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if our assumptions are otherwise incorrect, additional allowances may be required.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	We maintain reserves for our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product life-cycles, product demand and market conditions.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P32_S4	If actual product life-cycles, product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those originally projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	We account for acquired or merged businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition or merger at their respective fair values.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	Accordingly, for significant acquisitions, we typically obtain assistance from independent valuation specialists.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	There are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	For intangible assets, we typically utilize the income method.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the projected future cash flows (including timing) and the discount rate reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flows.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	For example, different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P37_S2	All of these judgments and estimates can significantly impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P37_S3	Our formal annual impairment testing date for goodwill is October 31 st or prior to the next annual testing date if an event occurs or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Under the amendments of ASC 350-10, ASU No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, beginning in the first quarter of 2012, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	If, we elect this option and after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	We have not elected this option to date.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process which requires us to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	The first step consists of estimating the fair value of our aggregated reporting unit using the market value of our common stock at October 31 st , multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares (market capitalization) and an implied control premium as if it were to be acquired by a single stockholder.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	We obtain information on completed sales of similar companies in a comparable industry to estimate an implied control premium for us.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	We compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value which includes goodwill.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	If the results of the initial market capitalization test produce results which are below the reporting unit carrying value, we will also consider if the market capitalization is temporarily low and, if so, we may also perform a discounted cash flow test.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the second step is completed to compute the impairment amount by determining the implied fair value of goodwill.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	This determination requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	Any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill which is compared to the corresponding carrying value to compute the goodwill impairment amount.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Long-Lived Assets and Acquired Intangible Assets.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	We periodically review long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and the impairment of such long-lived assets, if any, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P43_S2	No such indicators were noted in 2014 .
1094392_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	The fair value of our stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	The Black-Scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility, expected terms, risk-free rates and dividend yield.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	We use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	The expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options, and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	We have never paid cash dividends, and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends, and thus have assumed a 0% dividend yield.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	If our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share-based compensation cost, or if different assumptions had been used, we may have recorded too much or too little share-based compensation cost.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	for those shares expected to vest.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	If the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	While we engage in product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P51_S3	Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	The need for a valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred taxes will be recoverable.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, we may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P52_S2	At December 31, 2013 and 2014 , we had valuation allowances of $1.6 million and $2.4 million on certain of our deferred tax assets to reflect the deferred tax assets at the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P52_S3	We evaluated the realizability of the deferred tax assets based on positive earnings from 2012 through 2014 as well as the projected earnings in future years and believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized in the future years.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P52_S4	We will continue to monitor the realizability of the deferred tax assets and evaluate the valuation allowance.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	The first step requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that the tax position has met the threshold for recognition; therefore, we must evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	The second step requires us to measure the tax benefit of the tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized when effectively settled.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P53_S3	This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P53_S4	We reevaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues, and new audit activity.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P53_S5	Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P53_S6	Although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P53_S7	If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, it could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	This standard sets forth management s responsibility to evaluate, each reporting period, whether there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and if so, to provide related footnote disclosures.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P54_S2	The standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P54_S3	We are currently evaluating this new standard and expect it to have no material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	ASU 2014-09 outlines a comprehensive revenue recognition model and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P55_S2	ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company starting in the first quarter of 2017.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	retrospective adoption, meaning the cumulative effect of applying ASU 2014-09 is recognized as an adjustment to the 2017 opening retained earnings balance.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	We are in the process of determining the adoption method as well as the effects the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosure of Disposal of Components of an Entity.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	ASU 2014-08 address issues with reporting by changing the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and enhancing convergence of the FASB s and the International Accounting Standard Board s ( IASB ) reporting requirements for discontinued operations.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	The standard is effective for all businesses activities that, on acquisition, are classified as held for sale or all disposals of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years.
1094392_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	We are currently evaluating this new standard and expect it to have no impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate and Credit Market Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates and market liquidity including our investments in certain available-for-sale securities and our convertible senior notes.
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our available-for-sale securities consist of fixed and variable rate income investments (Municipal notes, bonds and an auction rate security).
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates, market liquidity and credit ratings of issuers from our available-for-sale securities.
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	It is possible that we are at risk if interest rates, market liquidity or credit ratings of issuers change in an unfavorable direction.
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The magnitude of any gain or loss will be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our financial investments held as of December 31, 2014 , an immediate adverse change of 10% in interest rates (e.g. 3.00% to 3.30%) would result in an immaterial decrease in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities.
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P0_S6	The interest rate on our convertible senior notes is fixed.
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Therefore, any change in interest rates will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Foreign Currency Risk We have branch operations in Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea and wholly-owned subsidiaries in Europe, Japan and China.
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our international subsidiaries and branches operate primarily using local functional currencies.
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	These foreign branches and subsidiaries are limited in their operations and level of investment so that the risk of currency fluctuations is not material.
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P1_S3	A hypothetical 10% appreciation or depreciation in the U.S. dollar relative to the reporting currencies of our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 would have affected the foreign-currency-denominated non-operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries by approximately $0.2 million .
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	A substantial portion of our international systems sales are denominated in U.S. dollars with the exception of Japan and, as a result, we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these sales.
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Substantially all our sales in Japan are denominated in Japanese yen.
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	From time to time, we may enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within 12 months.
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The change in fair value of the forward contracts is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations each reporting period.
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P3_S2	As of December 31, 2013 and 2014 , we had six and five forward contracts outstanding, respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P3_S3	The total notional contract value of these outstanding forward contracts at December 31, 2013 and 2014 was $1.0 million and $1.6 million , respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1094392_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	The consolidated financial statements required by this item are set forth on the pages indicated at Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1094392_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in SEC rules and forms.
1094392_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	These controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1094392_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, we have recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1094392_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management is required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures.
1094392_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	We performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, to assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2014 .
1094392_15_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Based on that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2014 at the reasonable assurance level.
1094392_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
1094392_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1094392_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) ( COSO ).
1094392_15_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014 .
1094392_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1094392_15_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1094392_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 have been audited by Ernst Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1094392_15_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Ernst Young LLP has also audited our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , as stated in its attestation report included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company s quarter ended December 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

1094392_15_ITEM15_P8_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rudolph Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P8_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).
1094392_15_ITEM15_P8_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P8_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P8_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1094392_15_ITEM15_P8_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P9_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P9_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P9_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P9_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Rudolph Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P9_S4	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P9_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Rudolph Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 20, 2015, expressed an unqualified opinion theron.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P10_S0	We have audited Rudolph Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
1094392_15_ITEM15_P10_S1	Rudolph Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P10_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P10_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1094392_15_ITEM15_P10_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P10_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P10_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P11_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P11_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P11_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P11_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P11_S4	In our opinion, Rudolph Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the COSO criteria.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P11_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Rudolph Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 of Rudolph Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries and our report dated February 20, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1094392_15_ITEM15_P17_S0	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: A. Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P17_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P17_S2	Revenue is recognized provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P17_S3	Revenue recognition generally results at the following points: (1) for all transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment for all products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment; the portion of revenue associated with certain installation-related tasks is deferred, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation-related tasks; (2) for products that have not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized at customer technical acceptance; (3) for transactions with arrangements with multiple elements, such as sales of products that include software and services, the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred using the relative selling price method utilizing vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) or estimated sales prices ( ESP ) until delivery of the deferred elements.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P18_S0	Third-party evidence is not typically used to determine selling prices as to limited availability of reliable competitor products selling prices.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P19_S0	The ESP is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, gross margin objectives, internal costs and competitor pricing strategies.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P20_S0	Revenues from parts sales are recognized at the time of shipment.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P20_S1	Revenue from training and service contracts is recognized ratably over the training period and contract period.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P20_S2	A provision for the estimated cost of fulfilling warranty obligations is recorded at the time the related revenue is recognized.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P20_S3	Revenue from software license fees is recognized upon shipment or customer acknowledgment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and VSOE exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P20_S4	License support and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P20_S5	Deferred revenue represents undelivered items, prepaid service contract revenue and prepaid license support and maintenance revenue.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P20_S6	Deferred revenue is recognized in accordance with the Company s revenue recognition policies described above.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P21_S0	C. Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P22_S0	consideration), recoverability and useful lives of property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets, recoverability of goodwill, recoverability of deferred tax assets, liabilities for product warranty, contingencies, including litigation reserves and share-based payments, including forfeitures and liabilities for tax uncertainties.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P22_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P23_S0	D. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include cash and highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P23_S1	E. Marketable Securities: The Company determined that all of its investment securities are to be classified as available-for-sale.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P23_S2	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity under the caption Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P23_S3	Realized gains and losses, interest and dividends on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income and other, net.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P24_S0	Available-for-sale securities are classified as current assets regardless of their maturity date if they are available for use in current operations.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P25_S0	The Company reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P25_S1	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, credit quality and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P25_S2	When a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities are charged against earnings.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P26_S0	The specific identification method is used to determine the gains and losses on marketable securities.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P26_S1	For additional information on the Company s marketable securities, see Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P27_S0	F. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P27_S1	In the cases where the Company is aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligation, the Company records a specific allowance against amounts due, and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount management reasonably believes will be collected.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P27_S2	For all other customers, the Company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are outstanding, industry and geographic concentrations, the current business environment and historical experience.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P28_S0	G. Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P29_S0	Cost includes material, labor and overhead costs.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P29_S1	Demonstration units, which are available for sale, are stated at their manufacturing costs and reserves are recorded to adjust the demonstration units to their net realizable value, if lower than cost.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P30_S0	H. Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P30_S1	Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which are thirty years for buildings, four to seven years for machinery and equipment, seven years for furniture and fixtures, and three years for computer equipment.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P30_S2	Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related asset.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P30_S3	Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and major renewals and betterments are capitalized.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P31_S0	I. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and identifiable acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P32_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P32_S1	If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is generally based on discounted cash flows.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P33_S0	J. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Intangible assets with definitive useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P33_S1	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually and when there are indications of impairment.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P34_S0	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P34_S1	Under the amendments of ASC 350-10, ASU No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, beginning in the first quarter of 2012, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P34_S2	If, the Company elects this option and after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is not likely that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P34_S3	The Company has not elected this option to date.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P35_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting unit using the market value of its common stock at October 31 multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares (market capitalization) and an implied control premium as it were to be acquired by a single stockholder.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P35_S1	The Company also obtains information on completed sales of similar companies in the related industry to estimate the implied control premium for the Company.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P36_S0	If the results of the initial market capitalization test produce results which are below the reporting unit carrying value, the Company may also perform a discounted cash flow test.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	The Company tested for goodwill impairment on October 31, 2014 .
1094392_15_ITEM15_P37_S1	For additional information on the Company s goodwill and purchased intangible assets, see Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	K. Concentration of Credit Risk: Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P38_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral for sales on credit.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P38_S2	The Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P38_S3	The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities with higher credit quality issuers and monitors the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P39_S0	L. Warranties: The Company generally provides a warranty on its products for a period of twelve to fifteen months against defects in material and workmanship.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P40_S0	M. Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach for deferred taxes which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company s consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P41_S0	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce a deferred tax asset to that portion which more likely than not will be realized.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign operations as it is the Company s intention to permanently re-invest undistributed earnings.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P42_S1	The impact of an uncertain income tax position is recognized as the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority and includes consideration of interest and penalties.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P42_S2	An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P42_S3	The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified as non-current unless the liability is expected to be settled in cash within 12 months of the reporting date.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P42_S4	For additional information on the Company s income taxes, see Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	N. Translation of Foreign Currencies: The Company has branch operations in Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea and wholly-owned subsidiaries in Europe, Japan and China.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P43_S1	Its international subsidiaries and branches operate primarily using local functional currencies.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P43_S2	These foreign branches and subsidiaries are limited in their operations and level of investment so that the risk of currency fluctuations is not material.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P43_S3	A substantial portion of the Company s international systems sales are denominated in U.S. dollars with the exception of Japan and, as a result, it has relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these sales.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P43_S4	Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and income and expense accounts and cash flow items are translated at average monthly exchange rates during the period.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P43_S5	Net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements and the effect of exchange rates on intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature are recorded directly as a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption, Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P43_S6	Any foreign currency gains or losses related to transactions are included in operating results.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P43_S7	The Company had accumulated exchange losses resulting from the translation of foreign operation financial statements of $1,645 and $2,685 as of December 31, 2013 and 2014 , respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P44_S1	The Black-Scholes valuation calculation requires the Company to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility, expected terms, risk-free interest rates and dividend yield.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P45_S0	Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company s stock.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P45_S1	The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P45_S2	The expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options, and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P45_S3	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P45_S4	The Company has never paid cash dividends, and does not currently intend to pay cash dividends, and thus has assumed a 0% dividend yield.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P46_S0	The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires significant judgment.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P46_S1	The Company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P46_S2	Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from the Company s current estimates.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P47_S0	Compensation expense for all share-based payments includes an estimate for forfeitures and is recognized over the expected term of the share-based awards using the straight-line method.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P47_S1	For additional information on the Company s share-based compensation plans, see Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P48_S0	P. Research and Development and Software Development Costs: Expenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P49_S0	Certain software product development costs incurred after technological feasibility has been established are capitalized and amortized, commencing upon the general release of the software product to the Company s customers, over the economic life of the software product.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P50_S0	Annual amortization of capitalized costs is computed using the greater of: (i) the ratio of current gross revenues for the software product over the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for the software product or (ii) the straight-line basis, typically over seven years.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P50_S1	Software product development costs incurred prior to the product reaching technological feasibility are expensed as incurred and included in research and development costs.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P50_S2	At December 31, 2013 and 2014 , capitalized software development costs were less than $25 .
1094392_15_ITEM15_P50_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2013 and 2014 , software development cost amortization totaled $361 , $185 and $5 , respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P51_S0	Q. Shipping and Handling Costs: Shipping and handling cost are included as a component of cost of revenues.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P51_S1	R. Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P51_S2	The carrying amount of our convertible senior notes was $51,751 and $54,773 as of December 31, 2013 and 2014 , respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P51_S3	The fair value of our convertible senior notes was $59,340 and $59,916 as of December 31, 2013 and 2014 , respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P51_S4	The Company s convertible senior notes are not publicly traded.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	The estimated fair value of these obligations is based, primarily, on a market approach, comparing the Company s interest rates to those rates the Company believes it would reasonably receive upon re-entry into the market.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P52_S1	Judgment is required to estimate the fair value, using available market information and appropriate valuation methods.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P52_S2	For additional information on the Company s fair value of financial instruments, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	S. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities: The Company, when it considers it to be appropriate, enters into forward contracts to hedge the economic exposures arising from foreign currency denominated transactions.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P53_S1	At December 31, 2013 and 2014 , these contracts included the future sale of Japanese Yen to purchase U.S. dollars.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P53_S2	The foreign currency forward contracts were entered into by the Company s Japanese subsidiary to hedge a portion of certain intercompany obligations.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P53_S3	The forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and therefore, the change in fair value is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P53_S4	The Company records its forward contracts at fair value in either prepaid expenses and other current assets or other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P53_S5	The dollar equivalent of the U.S. dollar forward contracts and related fair values as of December 31, 2013 and 2014 were as follows:
1094392_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	In 2012 , 2013 and 2014 , the Company recognized gains of $112 , $374 and $150 with respect to forward contracts that matured, respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P54_S1	The aggregate notional amount of matured contracts was $3,340 , $2,922 and $1,456 , for 2012 , 2013 and 2014 , respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2014 financial statement presentation.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P55_S1	These amounts include the reclassification of a portion of deferred tax assets from non-current assets to current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were not considered material to the prior year financial statements.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P56_S0	In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P56_S1	This standard sets forth management s responsibility to evaluate, each reporting period, whether there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and if so, to provide related footnote disclosures.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P56_S2	The standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P56_S3	The Company is currently evaluating this new standard and expects it to have no material impact on its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P57_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P57_S1	ASU 2014-09 outlines a comprehensive revenue recognition model and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P57_S2	ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company starting in the first quarter of 2017.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P57_S3	ASU 2014-09 allows for two methods of adoption: (a) full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented, or (b) modified retrospective adoption, meaning the cumulative effect of applying ASU 2014-09 is recognized as an adjustment to the 2017 opening retained earnings balance.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P57_S4	The Company is in the process of determining the adoption method as well as the effects the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P58_S0	In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosure of Disposal of Components of an Entity.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P58_S1	ASU 2014-08 address issues with reporting by changing the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and enhancing convergence of the FASB s and the International Accounting Standard Board s ( IASB ) reporting requirements for discontinued operations.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	The standard is effective for all businesses activities that, on acquisition, are classified as held for sale or all disposals of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P59_S1	The Company is currently evaluating this new standard and expect it to have no impact on its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P60_S0	Business Combinations: NanoPhotonics In June 2012, the Company announced that it had acquired specific assets and liabilities of NanoPhotonics GmbH, located in Mainz, Germany ( NanoPhotonics acquisition ).
1094392_15_ITEM15_P60_S1	The acquired business has been integrated into the Company s inspection technology group.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	The impact of the acquisition was not material to the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P62_S0	In December 2012, the Company announced that it had acquired Azores Corporation, located in Wilmington, Massachusetts ( Azores acquisition ).

1094392_15_ITEM15_P66_S0	Fair Value Measurements: The Company applies a three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurements.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P66_S1	This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P67_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P67_S1	Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P67_S2	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management s assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P68_S0	A financial asset s or liability s fair value measurement classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P68_S1	The following tables provide the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014 :

1094392_15_ITEM15_P98_S1	On and after April 15, 2016 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of July 15, 2016 , holders may convert their notes, in multiples of $1 principal amount, regardless of whether any of the foregoing conditions have been met.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P98_S2	Upon conversion, the Company will deliver to holders in respect of each $1 principal amount of Notes being converted a settlement amount equal to the sum of the daily settlement amounts for each of the 40 consecutive trading days during the applicable cash settlement averaging period.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P98_S3	The conversion value of each Note will be paid in: 1) cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be converted, and 2) to the extent the conversion value exceeds the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted, the Company s common stock in respect of the remainder (plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of common stock).
1094392_15_ITEM15_P98_S4	The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain circumstances but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.

1094392_15_ITEM15_P102_S1	Each of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions were entered into with an affiliate of the initial purchaser of the Notes (the Option Counterparty ).
1094392_15_ITEM15_P102_S2	The convertible note hedge is intended to reduce the potential future dilution to the Company s common stock associated with the conversion of the Notes.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P102_S3	However, the warrant transaction will have a dilutive effect on the Company s earnings per share to the extent that the price of the Company s common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrant.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P103_S0	The strike price of the warrant is initially $17.00 per share.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P103_S1	Each of these components is discussed separately below: Convertible Note Hedge .
1094392_15_ITEM15_P104_S0	The Option Counterparty agreed to sell to the Company up to approximately 4,634 shares of the Company s common stock, which is the maximum number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, at a price of $12.95 per share.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P104_S1	The convertible note hedge transaction will be settled in shares of the Company s common stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) and will expire on the earlier of the second scheduled trading day (as defined in the Indenture) prior to the maturity date of the Notes or the last day any of the Notes remain outstanding.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P104_S2	Subject to certain terms and conditions, settlement of the convertible note hedge would result in the Company receiving shares of the Company s common stock equivalent to the number of shares that the Company is obligated to deliver to holders of the Notes upon conversion of the Notes.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P104_S3	The Company will not be required to make any cash payments to the Option Counterparty or its affiliates upon the exercise of the options that are a part of the convertible note hedge transaction, but will be entitled to receive from the Option Counterparty a number of shares of Company common stock generally based on the amount by which the market price per share of Company common stock, as measured under the terms of the convertible note hedge transaction, is greater than the strike price of the convertible note hedge transaction during the relevant valuation period under the convertible note hedge transaction.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P104_S4	The convertible note hedge transaction cost of $14,507 has been accounted for as an equity transaction.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P104_S5	The Company received $7,007 from the Option Counterparty from the sale of the warrant to purchase up to approximately 4,634 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $17.00 per share.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P104_S6	As of December 31, 2014 , the warrant had an expected life of 3.0 years and expires between October 13, 2016 and January 9, 2017 .
1094392_15_ITEM15_P104_S7	As of December 31, 2014 , the warrant had not been exercised and remained outstanding.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P104_S8	Additionally, if the market price per share of Company common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant transaction, exceeds the strike price of the warrant during the valuation period at the maturity of the warrant, the Company will owe the Option Counterparty a number of shares of Company common stock in an amount based on the excess of such market price per share of Company common stock over the strike price of the warrant.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P105_S0	The fair value of the warrant was initially recorded in equity and continues to be classified as equity.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P106_S0	The convertible note hedge transaction and the warrant transaction are separate transactions entered into by the Company.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P106_S1	Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the convertible note hedge transaction and the warrant transaction.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P107_S0	The Company has entered into agreements with customers that include limited intellectual property indemnification obligations that are customary in the industry.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P107_S1	These guarantees generally require the Company to compensate the other party for certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising from these transactions.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P108_S0	The nature of the intellectual property indemnification obligations prevents the Company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay to its customers.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P108_S1	Historically, the Company has not made any indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P109_S0	The Company generally provides a warranty on its products for a period of twelve to fifteen months against defects in material and workmanship.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P109_S1	The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred during the warranty period and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P109_S2	The Company s estimate is based primarily on historical experience.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P109_S3	The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P109_S4	Settlements of warranty reserves are generally associated with sales that occurred during the 12 to 15 months prior to the year-end and warranty accruals are related to sales during the year.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P109_S5	Changes in the Company s warranty reserves are as follows:
1094392_15_ITEM15_P110_S0	Legal Matters From time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P111_S0	As previously disclosed, in December 2007 , the Company completed the acquisition of specific assets and liabilities of the semiconductor division of Applied Precision LLC ( Applied ).
1094392_15_ITEM15_P111_S1	As a result of the acquisition, the Company assumed certain liabilities of Applied including a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court, District of Arizona, by Integrated Technology Corporation ( ITC ) which alleged Applied s PrecisionPoint , PrecisionWoRx and ProbeWoRx products infringed an ITC patent (Integrated Technology Corporation v. Rudolph Technologies, Inc., No. CV-06-2182-PHX-ROS).
1094392_15_ITEM15_P111_S2	Prior to trial, the District Court ruled that such products sold prior to August of 2007 (the pre-August 2007 tools ) infringed the ITC patent.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P111_S3	At trial in December of 2011 , a trial verdict was rendered in which the jury found that while the Company s products manufactured after August of 2007 (the post- August 2007 tools ) did not literally infringe ITC s patent, the products were found to infringe under a rule known as the doctrine of equivalents, a legal principle which expands the language of patent claims to encompass products or processes which may otherwise be found not to literally infringe the patent.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P111_S4	The jury awarded $15,475 to ITC in damages for sales made during the years 2000-2011 , of which approximately one-half related to sales for pre- August 2007 tools.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P111_S5	August 2007 tools, the infringement was willful.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P111_S6	On July 23, 2012 , the District Court issued an Order which affirmed the jury s award, applied treble damages to the portion of the jury award related to post- August 2007 tool sales and granted ITC s motion for attorney s fees and prejudgment interest on the verdict and attorney s fees.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P111_S7	At that time, the District Court also enjoined the Company from future infringement of the ITC patent and from selling or supplying the applicable products with the applicable features from or into the United States.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P111_S8	The Company appealed the injunction, the District Court Order and the damages assessment.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P111_S9	In October 2012 , the injunction was stayed by the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals and thereafter in June of 2013 , the patent expired.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P111_S10	On November 4, 2013 , the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals issued a ruling which reversed the judgment of infringement against all post- August 2007 tools, reversed the finding of willfulness, vacated the treble damages award, vacated the award of attorney s fees and costs, remanded the issue back to the District Court for further review, and affirmed the award of damages and interest for the pre- August 2007 tools.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P112_S0	With regard to the damages assessment against the pre- August 2007 tools, on March 4, 2014 , the Company filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court to appeal the basis of the Federal Court of Appeals decision affirming the damages award for the pre- August 2007 tools.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P112_S1	On June 30, 2014 , the Supreme Court denied the Company s Petition and as a result, the Company increased its related litigation accrual by $9,622 for a total accrual of $13,865 .
1094392_15_ITEM15_P112_S2	On July 22, 2014 , the Company then paid to ITC $10,613 which represented only the damages and interest portion of the judgment.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P112_S3	Since the patent expired in June of 2013 and payment of the judgment has been made, this matter is fully resolved with the sole exception of the issue of the remanded attorney s fees.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P112_S4	On August 8, 2014 , the District Court issued an order for setting the attorney s fees award at $3,252 which the Company appealed to the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals on September 5, 2014 .
1094392_15_ITEM15_P112_S5	The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses regarding this issue and intend to continue to vigorously prosecute the matter.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P112_S6	The $3,252 is held in escrow and is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P112_S7	The corresponding liability is recorded under the caption, Other current liabilities, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P112_S8	The Company expects this to be the maximum liability reasonably possible for the attorney s fees, excluding interest, for this lawsuit with respect to both the pre- August 2007 and post- 2007 August tools.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P113_S0	In the Company s patent infringement suit against Camtek, Ltd., of Migdal Hamek, Israel, concerning its proprietary continuous scan wafer inspection technology, the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals issued a ruling on August 22, 2011 .
1094392_15_ITEM15_P113_S1	No. 6,826,298 valid, (ii) the part of the infringement ruling based on the finding that Camtek s Falcon product strobes based on velocity, and (iii) the dismissal of Camtek s claim against the Company for inequitable conduct against the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P113_S2	The court did, however, revise one claim construction ruling made by the District Court in the original case.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P113_S3	As a result, the Appellate Court set aside the verdict delivered by the jury for damages and the District Court s decision to enter an injunction against Camtek s selling Falcon tools in the U.S. and remanded the case back to the trial court for a limited trial on this single infringement issue.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P114_S0	to infringe the Company s patent even under the revised claim construction of the patent, obviating the need for the limited trial.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P114_S1	On February 9, 2015, the District Court issued an Order granting the Company s Motion for Final Judgment, reinstating the original damages and applying prejudgment interest for a total award of $14,512 .
1094392_15_ITEM15_P114_S2	In addition, the District Court issued a permanent injunction against Camtek from making, using, selling and offering to sell any of its Falcon machines and any machines that are colorable imitations thereof in the United States, intended for sale and use within the United States, until the expiration of the 6,298 patent [projected to be in 2020].

1094392_15_ITEM15_P136_S0	The components of income tax expense (benefit) are as follows:
1094392_15_ITEM15_P137_S0	The income (loss) before tax are comprised of the following:
1094392_15_ITEM15_P138_S0	The income tax benefit of $14,458 in 2012, was impacted by benefits related to the release of valuation allowance recorded against U.S. deferred tax assets, partially offset by taxes accrued in both the U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P138_S1	The income tax benefit of $1,925 in 2013 was impacted by benefits related to the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits, foreign tax credits and research and development credits for both 2012 and 2013 recognized in 2013, which were not available in 2012 as a result of legislation, and $1.3 million of expense related to a correction of the prior year income tax balances recognized in the fourth quarter of 2013.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P138_S2	The income tax benefit of $2,051 in 2014, was impacted by an increase in the Company s valuation allowance and taxes accrued in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by research and development tax credit.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P139_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2013 and 2014 to income before provision for income taxes as follows:
1094392_15_ITEM15_P140_S0	Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income and the domestic manufacturing deduction.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P141_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised of the following:
1094392_15_ITEM15_P142_S0	At December 31, 2013 and 2014 , the Company had valuation allowances of $1,646 and $2,445 , respectively, on certain of our deferred tax assets to reflect the deferred tax assets at the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P143_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company uses a more likely than not standard.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P143_S1	If it is determined that it is more-likely-than-not that deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against the deferred tax assets.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P144_S0	The ultimate realization of the assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences become deductible.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P144_S1	Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies when making this assessment.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P144_S2	In making the determination that it is more likely than not that the Company s deferred tax assets will be realized as of December 31, 2014, the Company relied primarily on projected future taxable income.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P144_S3	At December 31, 2014 , the Company had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $1,371 , $427 and $1,351 , respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P144_S4	In addition, as of December 31, 2013 the Company had federal AMT carryforwards of $130 .
1094392_15_ITEM15_P144_S5	The federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards expire on various dates through December 31, 2032 , December 31, 2032 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P144_S6	At December 31, 2014 , the Company had federal and state research development credits and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $7,795 , $1,814 and $6,183 , respectively.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P144_S7	The federal research development credits are set to expire at various dates through December 31, 2034 .
1094392_15_ITEM15_P144_S8	The state research development credits are set to expire at various dates through December 21, 2024 .
1094392_15_ITEM15_P144_S9	The foreign tax credit is set to expire at various dates through December 31, 2024 .
1094392_15_ITEM15_P144_S10	A provision has not been made at December 31, 2014 for U.S. or additional foreign withholding taxes on approximately $1,606 of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in Europe and Japan because it is the present intention of management to permanently reinvest these undistributed earnings.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P144_S11	Upon distribution of those earnings, U.S. taxes on such permanently reinvested foreign earnings would be recorded net of applicable foreign tax credits and withholding taxes, if any.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P145_S0	It is not practical to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be remitted.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P145_S1	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:
1094392_15_ITEM15_P146_S0	Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2013 and 2014 are unrecognized tax benefits of $4,278 and $4,499 , respectively, which would be reflected as an adjustment to income tax expense if recognized.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P146_S1	The year over year decrease from 2012 to 2014 is primarily due to the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits related to federal tax exposures.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P146_S2	It is reasonably possible that certain amounts of unrecognized tax benefits may reverse in the next 12 months; however, the Company does not expect such reversals would have a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P146_S3	The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P146_S4	During the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2013 and 2014 , the Company recognized approximately $557 , $(768) and $60 , respectively, in interest and penalties expense associated with uncertain tax positions.

1094392_15_ITEM15_P147_S1	The Company files U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign tax returns.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P147_S2	For U.S. federal purposes, the Company is generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2011.

1094392_15_ITEM15_P147_S5	Certain carryforward tax attributes generated in prior years remain subject to examination and adjustment.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P147_S6	During the first quarter of 2014, the Company received a final assessment of $0.2 million from the Internal Revenue Service, representing closure of the audit for 2007 through 2009.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P147_S7	The assessment was fully offset by a decrease to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in 2014.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P147_S8	The Company believes that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from any future examinations of these years.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P148_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against it.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P148_S1	Although the Company believes its tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from the Company s historical income tax provisions and accruals.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P148_S2	The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P149_S0	Restructuring During 2014 , the Company implemented restructuring initiatives designed to reduce the Company s cost structure.
1094392_15_ITEM15_P149_S1	In connection with this strategy, the Company reduced its global headcount by approximately 9%, ending with 586 employees at December 31, 2014 .
1094392_15_ITEM15_P149_S2	In addition, the Company will close its facility in Mainz, Germany and relocate the operations to its facilities in Snoqualmie, Washington and Bloomington, Minnesota with a target completion of March 2015.

1094392_16_ITEM1_P4_S2	To this end, Rudolph introduced Equipment Sentinel fault detection and classification software that integrates formerly independent data streams into a powerful monitoring and control engine to enable timely actionable information, greatly enhancing optimization capabilities with predictive analytics in the fab.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	Wafer dicing is one of the final steps in semiconductor manufacturing when a wafer has completed its processing and the individual die is ready to be packaged.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	The evolution of semiconductor device materials for advanced packaging has resulted in more stringent dicing process requirements.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	Process deviations and excursions during die singulation can result in chips and cracks that impact the long-term reliability of devices.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	In 2015 Rudolph announced a partnership with DISCO Corporation, a leading manufacturer of wafer saw and dicing solutions, to improve the wafer saw process.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	Rudolph s NSX inspection system performs post-saw inspection while Rudolph s new Equipment Sentinel fault detection and classification (FDC) software allows for real time monitoring and feedback of DISCO s dicing tools.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	The partnership provides a comprehensive solution to improve device reliability and data reporting, while at the same time lowering costs and decreasing ramp times.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	In 2015 Rudolph announced its acquisition of Stella Alliance, LLC, a Massachusetts-based semiconductor inspection technology intellectual property (IP) portfolio company.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	Stella Alliance s patented illumination, auto-focus and image acquisition technology significantly enhances the ability to identify certain critical defects not visible with current techniques.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P9_S2	With this acquisition, Rudolph expects to add a next-generation, high-resolution inspection system to its portfolio of solutions in 2016.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	Industry Trends Advanced Packaging is a key technology that enables the miniaturization of electronic products, such as portable consumer devices, including smartphones and laptops.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	In electronics manufacturing, integrated circuit packaging is the final stage of semiconductor device fabrication, in which the tiny block of semiconducting material (die) is encased in a supporting package that provides an external electrical connection and prevents physical damage and corrosion.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	Packaging refers loosely to the conductors and other structures that interconnect the circuits, feed them with electric power, discharge their heat and protect them from damage.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P11_S2	Today, the drive to pack more functions into a small space and reduce their power requirements demands that chip packages do much more than ever before.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P11_S3	Examples of advanced packaging are varied and include flip-chip bumping, pillar bumping, wafer-level chip scale packaging and 3D packaging.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P11_S4	One solution using advanced packaging is the 3D integration of semiconductors and other devices.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P11_S5	The technology involves stacking individual die or wafers in one integrated housing.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P11_S6	Through silicon vias (TSV, 3D stacking) allow communication among the individual components.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P11_S7	This offers the advantages of shorter signal paths and reduced power consumption, enhanced bandwidths, integration of heterogeneous components such as sub-chips, smaller surface area and reduced expense.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P11_S8	The processes required for 3D integration are still being optimized for yield, and to ensure the functioning of individual microchips.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	The current and projected adoption of smart mobile devices drives designed-in capability.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	There are no longer single function devices, but instead, various devices have been combined to provide multiple functions.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P12_S2	For example, smart phone users no longer need a GPS, digital camera and PDA.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P12_S3	With the addition of a myriad of available apps, the potential uses seem endless.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P12_S4	As a result, advancements in mobile products are driving semiconductor advanced packaging and display manufacturers to implement next-generation technologies to meet the resulting requirements.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P12_S5	This technology shift has created multiple opportunities for Rudolph solutions.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	Scalable technology is rapidly increasing in importance.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	Advanced packaging facilities looking to improve Cost of Ownership ( COO ) and increase productivity are transitioning to large rectangular panels ranging up to Gen 3.5 (approximately 650mm x 720mm).
1094392_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	Traditional technology has been limited to standard wafer sizes.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	However, with companies progressively moving to fan-out packages, they are no longer limited to operating within the constraints of a round wafer.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	of customers technical roadmaps, Rudolph is optimally positioned to capitalize on the emerging market of advanced packaging panel lithography.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	The JetStep S Series, having emerged from the flat panel display market, is readily capable of processing both glass and organic laminate panels in the semiconductor advanced packaging market.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	Technology We believe that our expertise in engineering and our continued investment in research and development enable us to rapidly develop new technologies and products in response to emerging industry trends.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	The breadth of our technology enables us to offer a diverse combination of process and process control solutions.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	Unique features have been designed into our lithography systems to meet our customers changing process requirements.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P17_S3	Our metrology and inspection technologies provide process control for the majority of wafers processed today in semiconductor manufacturing.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P17_S4	In front-end processes, thin film metrology and defect detection and classification technologies allow yield enhancement for critical processes such as photolithography, diffusion, etch, CMP and outgoing quality control.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P17_S5	Within the final manufacturing (back-end) processes, advanced macro defect inspection provides our customers with critical quality assurance and process information.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing or general handling, and can have a major impact on device and process quality.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	Lastly, we turn all of the data gathered into useful knowledge for our customers to make yield-enhancing decisions.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	Chip manufacturers deploy advanced macro defect inspection throughout the fab to monitor key process steps, gather process-enhancing information and ultimately, lower manufacturing costs.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P18_S3	Field-established tools such as the F30 and NSX inspection systems are found in wafer processing (front-end) and final manufacturing (back-end) facilities around the world.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P18_S4	These high-speed tools incorporate features such as waferless recipe creation, tool-to-tool correlation and multiple inspection resolutions.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P18_S5	In addition to wafer frontside inspection, Rudolph s innovative Explorer Platform allows wafer edge and backside inspection in one integrated platform to enhance productivity and continuously improve fab yield.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Using Discover yield management software, the vast amount of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed and classified to determine trends that ultimately affect yield.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	All-surface refers to inspection of the wafer frontside, edge, and backside as well as post-fab die.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	The edge inspection process focuses on the area near the wafer edge, an area that poses difficulty for traditional wafer frontside inspection technology due to its varied topography and process variation.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	Edge bevel inspection looks for defects on the side edge of a wafer.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	Edge bead removal and edge exclusion metrology involve a topside surface measurement required exclusively in the photolithography process, primarily to determine if wafers have been properly aligned for the edge exclusion region.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	The primary reason for wafer backside inspection is to determine if contamination has been created that may spread throughout the fab.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	For instance, it is critical that the wafer backside be free of defects prior to the photolithography process to prevent focus and exposure problems on the wafer frontside.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	Automating the defect detection and classification process is best done by a system that can mimic, or even extend, the response of the human eye, but at a much higher speed, with high resolution and more consistency.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	To do this, our systems capture full-color whole wafer images using simultaneous dark and bright field illumination.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	The resulting bright and dark field images are compared to those from an ideal wafer having no defects.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P24_S3	When a difference is detected, its image is broken down into mathematical vectors that allow rapid and accurate comparison with a library of known classified defects stored in the tool s database.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P24_S4	Patented and proprietary enhancements of this approach enable very fast and highly repeatable image classification.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P24_S5	The system is pre-programmed with an extensive library of default local, global and color defects and can also absorb a virtually unlimited amount of new defect classes.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P24_S6	This allows customers to define defects based on their existing defect classification system, provides more reliable automated rework decisions and enables more accurate statistical process control data.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P24_S7	Classifying defects off-line enables automated inspection systems to maintain their high throughput.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P24_S8	Using defect image files captured by automated inspection systems, operators are able to view high-resolution defect images to determine defects that cause catastrophic failure of a device, or killer defects.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P24_S9	Classifying defects enables faster analysis by grouping defects found together as one larger defect, a scratch for example, and defects of similar types across a wafer lot to be grouped based on size, repeating defects and other user-defined specifications.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P24_S10	Automatically classifying defects provides far greater yield learning than human classification.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	Using wafer maps, charts and graphs, the vast amounts of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed to determine trends across bumps, die, wafers and lots.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	This analysis may determine where in the process a variation is being introduced, allowing for enhancements to be made and yields improved.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	Defect data analysis is performed to identify, analyze and locate the source of defects and other manufacturing process excursions.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	Using either a single wafer map or a composite map created from multiple wafer maps, this analysis enables identification of defect patterns and distribution.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P26_S2	When combined with inspection data from strategically-placed inspection points, this analysis may pinpoint the source of the defects so corrective action can be taken.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P26_S3	The combination of Fast 3D-OCM (optical comparative metrology) Technology with improved testing accuracy and repeatability is designed to reduce total test time for even the most advanced large area probe cards.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P26_S4	The 3-D capabilities enable users to analyze probe marks and probe tips in a rapid and information-rich format.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	Optical acoustic metrology involves the use of ultra-fast laser induced sonar for metal and opaque thin film measurement.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	This technology sends ultrasonic waves into multi-layer opaque films and then analyzes the resulting echoes to simultaneously determine the thickness of each individual layer in complex multi-layer metal film stacks.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	The echo s amplitude and phase can be used to detect film properties, missing layers and interlayer problems.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P27_S3	Since different phenomena affect amplitude and phase uniquely, a variety of process critical interlayer problems can be detected in a single measurement.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	The use of optical acoustics to measure multi-layer metal and opaque films was pioneered by scientists at Brown University ( Brown ) in collaboration with engineers at Rudolph.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	The proprietary optical acoustic technology in our PULSE Technology systems measures the thickness of single or multi-layer opaque films ranging from less than 40 Angstroms to greater than five microns.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P28_S2	It provides these measurements at a rate of up to 70 wafers per hour within one to two percent accuracy and typically less than one percent repeatability.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P28_S3	This range of thicknesses covers the majority of thick and thin metal films projected by the International Roadmap for Semiconductors to be used through the end of this decade.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our non-contact, non-destructive optical acoustic technology and small spot size enable our PULSE Technology systems to measure film properties directly on product wafers.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	The Meta PULSE System gives customers the ability to simultaneously measure the thickness and other properties of up to six metal or other opaque film layers in a non-contact manner on product wafers.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	PULSE Technology uses an ultra-fast laser to generate sound waves that pass down through a stack of opaque films such as those used in copper or aluminum interconnect processes, sending back to the surface an echo that indicates film thickness, density, and other process critical parameters.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	We believe we are a leader in providing systems that can non-destructively measure opaque thin-film stacks with the speed and accuracy semiconductor device manufacturers demand in order to achieve high yields with the latest fabrication processes.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P30_S2	The technology is ideal for characterizing copper interconnect structures.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P30_S3	The Meta PULSE System, used mainly for fast and accurate measurements of metal interconnect in front-end wafer processing applications, has now been chosen by back-end manufacturers to perform system measurements in new process applications, driven by the need for on-product metrology as feature sizes decrease and pattern densities increase.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	SONUS Technology is designed for measuring thick films and film stacks used in copper pillar bumps and for detecting defects, such as voids, in TSVs.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	SONUS Technology is a non-contact, non-destructive acoustic metrology and defect detection technique that is designed to be of higher resolution, faster, and less costly than alternative techniques.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P31_S2	SONUS Technology meets a critical need for measuring and inspecting the structures used to connect chips to each other and to the outside world.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P31_S3	Copper pillar bumps and TSVs are critical interconnect technologies enabling 2.5D and 3D packaging.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	Plating process control for copper pillar bumping is directly related to the mechanical integrity of the interconnect and final device performance.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	Likewise, the quality of the TSV fill is critical to the electrical performance of stacked devices.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	Rudolph s patented SONUS Technology offers the unique ability to measure individual films and film stacks to thicknesses of 100 m and detect voids as small as 0.5 m in TSVs with aspect ratios of 10:1 or greater.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	Ellipsometry is a non-contact, non-destructive optical technique for transparent thin film measurement.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	We have been an industry leader in ellipsometry technology for the last three decades.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P34_S2	We hold patents on several ellipsometry technologies, including our proprietary technique that uses four lasers for multiple-angle of incidence, multiple wavelength ellipsometry.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	for future generations of semiconductor devices.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	We extended this same optical technology to characterize the scatterometry signal from patterned surfaces, allowing measurement of critical dimensions.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	For applications requiring broader spectral coverage, some of our ellipsometry tools are also equipped with a reflectometer.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	Reflectometry uses a white or ultraviolet light source to determine the properties of transparent thin films by analyzing the wavelength and intensity of light reflected from the surface of a wafer.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	This optical information is processed with software algorithms to determine film thickness and other material properties.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P36_S2	By combining data from both the laser ellipsometer and broad spectrum reflectometer, it is possible to characterize films and film stacks that cannot be adequately analyzed by either method individually.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	Rudolph s patented transparent film technology uses up to four lasers operating simultaneously at multiple angles and multiple wavelengths, providing powerful analysis and measurement capabilities.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	Unlike the white-light sources used in spectroscopic ellipsometers, laser light sources make our metrology tools inherently stable, increase measurement speed and accuracy, and reduce maintenance costs by minimizing the time required to re-qualify a light source when it is replaced.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	Rudolph s S3000SX System is targeted for transparent films in advanced semiconductor fabrication applications at the 28nm node and below.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	The S3000 product family uses Rudolph s proprietary Focused Beam Ellipsometry ( FBE ) and newly-designed Small Site Measurement Optics ( SSMO ) to measure the thickness of single layer and multi-layer films on product wafers including device area at site sizes as small as 30x30 nanometers.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Lithography Business Step and Repeat Technology.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	Rudolph steppers use projection optics to expose circuit patterns from a mask or reticle onto a substrate to achieve images with optimal fidelity.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	These systems employ light from a mercury arc lamp that is transmitted through a mask or reticle containing display circuit patterns.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	Substrates are aligned on the system and the mask is imaged through a projection lens in photoresist material coated on the substrate.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P42_S2	The substrate is then moved, or stepped, to a second position to expose an adjacent area.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P42_S3	Images can be stitched together precisely to form larger circuit patterns without any noticeable change in circuit performance.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P42_S4	The system repeats the step and exposure process until the entire substrate is patterned.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P42_S5	Once the exposure process has been completed, the substrate is developed with an alkali solution to reveal the underlying material.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P42_S6	The imaged photoresist serves as a barrier that allows for the processing of the underlying metal or insulating layers.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P42_S7	The substrates then continue through the etching, stripping and deposition processes until multi-layer circuits are completed.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	In order to deal with increased Input/Output, enhanced functionality, power efficiency and higher frequency, Integrated Device Manufacturers and Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test facilities ( OSATs ) are moving to advanced packaging technologies such as TSV and three Dimensional Integrated Circuits ( 3DIC ).
1094392_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	However, the associated substrates and processes are significantly different than those used in front-end wafer processing.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	The added performance requires finer features, but the processes stress the substrates resulting in warped substrates.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Since most packaging is an additive process, thick films are used to enable the creation of features.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	In order for equipment to effectively function in this environment, it must overcome these challenges.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P44_S2	Rudolph s JetStep Systems have been specifically designed to meet these challenges head on.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P44_S3	The JetStep W Series is designed for wafers and other round substrates while the JetStep S Series is designed for rectangular substrates (panels).
1094392_16_ITEM1_P44_S4	Both systems boast a large printable field, which when combined with user-selectable wavelength options, maximizes throughput while not limiting resolution when needed.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P44_S5	High fidelity optics are able to image the fine features required while at the same time achieving superior depth of field to minimize non-flatness effects.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P44_S6	On-the-fly auto focus and an innovative reticle management system improve yield and utilization.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P44_S7	These unique features result in a revolutionary lithography system specifically designed to meet advanced packaging challenges.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Flat Panel Display ( FPD ) Lithography .
1094392_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	A critical aspect of any leading mobile device is the display.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	The display serves as the window to the user.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P46_S2	Therefore, it must effectively present graphics such as detailed maps, high resolution photos and streaming video in order to meet user expectations.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P46_S3	To accomplish this, the display transistor backplane, which is what controls the pixels, must operate at a high frequency and have high pixel resolution.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P46_S4	As a result, the transistors must have high mobility and only use a small portion of the pixel aperture.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	The backplane is manufactured on a sheet of glass; like the packaging substrate, it is non-flat and tends to distort further during processing.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	Additionally, the displays are getting larger.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P47_S2	Manufacturers are looking to utilize larger sheets of glass, making throughput a challenge for the lithography equipment.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	printable stepper field available enabling more displays per shot.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	This feature, combined with on-the-fly auto-focus and magnification compensation, maximizes throughput and yield.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P48_S2	Finally, our patented grid stage allows the system to be easily scaled to meet the customer desired substrate size.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	Integrated Software Solutions Process Control Software .
1094392_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	We provide a wide range of advanced process control solutions, all designed to improve factory profitability, including run-to-run control, fault detection, classification and tool automation.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	Rudolph is a leading provider of Process Control Software in the semiconductor industry.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	Advanced process control (APC) employs software to automatically detect or predict tool failure (fault detection) as well as calculate recipe settings for a process that will drive the process output to target despite variations in the incoming material and disturbances within the process equipment.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	Process control software enables the factory to increase capacity and yield and to decrease rework and scrap.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P51_S2	It enables reduced production costs by lowering consumables, process engineering time and manufacturing cycle time.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P51_S3	Semiconductor manufacturers use YMS to obtain valuable process yield and equipment productivity information.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P51_S4	The data necessary to generate productivity information comes from many different sources throughout the fab: inspection and metrology systems, tool sensors, tool recipes, electrical tests and the fab environment.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P51_S5	As the complexity and cost of manufacturing processes increase, the value of faster, better analysis to support critical manufacturing decisions grows too, so customers are demanding robust yield management systems that can analyze large, complex data sets quickly and effectively.

1094392_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	We believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products is critical to our success.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P56_S2	Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our technical, management and financial resources to research and development programs.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P56_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 188 research and development personnel.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P56_S4	Our research and development expenditures in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were $41.2 million , $40.6 million and $40.0 million , respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P56_S5	We expect to continue our strong commitment to new product development and continue to allocate significant resources to these efforts in the future.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	We maintain an extensive network of direct sales, customer service and application support offices in the United States, Europe and Asia.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	We provide our customers with comprehensive support before, during and after the delivery of our products.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P57_S2	For example, in order to facilitate the smooth integration of our tools into our customers operations, we often assign dedicated, site-specific field service and applications engineers to provide long-term support at selected customer sites.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P57_S3	We also provide comprehensive service and applications training for customers at our training facilities in Bloomington, Minnesota and Budd Lake, New Jersey and at customer locations.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P57_S4	In addition, we maintain a group of highly skilled applications scientists at strategically located facilities throughout the world and at selected customer locations.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P57_S5	As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 241 sales and marketing, service and applications support personnel.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	Manufacturing Our principal manufacturing activities include assembly, final test and calibration.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	These activities are conducted in our manufacturing facilities in Bloomington, Minnesota and Wilmington, Massachusetts.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P58_S2	Our core manufacturing competencies include electrical, optical and mechanical assembly and testing, as well as the management of new product transitions.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P58_S3	While we use standard components and subassemblies wherever possible, most mechanical parts, metal fabrications and critical components used in our products are engineered and manufactured to our specifications.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P58_S4	We continue to rely on subcontractors and turnkey suppliers to fabricate components, build assemblies and perform other non-core activities in a cost-effective manner.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P58_S5	As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 72 manufacturing personnel.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P58_S6	We rely on a number of limited source suppliers for certain parts and subassemblies.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P58_S7	This reliance creates a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components, and reduced control over pricing and time of delivery of components.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P58_S8	An inability to obtain adequate supplies would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or might require us to redesign our systems to accommodate different components or subassemblies.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P58_S9	To date, we have not experienced any significant delivery delays.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P58_S10	However, if we were forced to seek alternative sources of supply, manufacture such components or subassemblies internally, or redesign our products, this could prevent us from shipping our products to our customers on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	We have a policy of seeking patents on inventions governing new products or technologies as part of our ongoing research, development, and manufacturing activities.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , we have been granted, or hold exclusive licenses to, 254 U.S. and foreign patents.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	The patents we own, jointly own or exclusively license have expiration dates ranging from 2016 to 2033 .
1094392_16_ITEM1_P59_S3	We also have 107 pending regular and provisional applications in the U.S. and other countries.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P59_S4	Our patents and applications principally cover various aspects of macro-defect detection and classification, transparent thin film measurement, altered material characterization, lithography techniques and automation.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P59_S5	We have been granted exclusive licenses from Brown University Research Foundation, subject to rights retained by Brown and the United States government for their own non-commercial uses, for several patents relating to the optical acoustic technology underlying our MetaPULSE product family.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P59_S6	The terms of these exclusive licenses are equal to the lives of the patents.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P59_S7	We pay royalties to Brown based upon a percentage of our revenues from the sale of systems that incorporate technology covered by the Brown patents.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P59_S8	We also have the right to support patent activity with respect to new ultra-fast acoustic technology developed by Brown scientists, and to acquire exclusive licenses to this technology.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P59_S9	Brown may terminate the licenses if we fail to pay royalties to Brown or if we materially breach our license agreement with Brown.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P59_S10	Our pending patents may never be issued, and even if they are, these patents, our existing patents and the patents we license may not provide sufficiently broad protection to protect our proprietary rights, or they may prove to be unenforceable.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P59_S11	To protect our proprietary rights, we also rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions and licenses.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P59_S12	There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same degree as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial infringement problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in such countries, some of which are countries in which we have sold and continue to sell products.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	There is a risk that our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P60_S2	For example, our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P60_S3	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	Competition The market for semiconductor capital equipment is highly competitive.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P61_S1	We face substantial competition from established companies in each of the markets that we serve.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P61_S2	We principally compete with KLA-Tencor, Camtek and Ultratech.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P61_S3	We compete to a lesser extent with companies such as Nanometrics, Nova Measuring Instruments and Nikon.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P61_S4	Each of our products also competes with products that use different metrology and inspection techniques.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P61_S5	Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, broader product offerings and service capabilities and larger installed customer bases than we do.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P61_S6	Significant competitive factors in the market for inspection and metrology systems include system performance, ease of use, reliability, cost of ownership, technical support and customer relationships.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P61_S7	We believe that, while price and delivery are important competitive factors, the customers overriding requirement is for a product that meets their technical capabilities.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P61_S8	To remain competitive, we believe we will need to maintain a high level of investment in research and development and process applications.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P61_S9	No assurances can be given that we will continue to be competitive in the future.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	Backlog We schedule production of our systems based upon order backlog and informal customer forecasts.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	We include in backlog only those orders to which the customer has assigned a purchase order number and for which delivery is anticipated within 12 months.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	At December 31, 2015 , we had a backlog of approximately $54.0 million compared with a backlog of approximately $37.6 million at December 31, 2014 .
1094392_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	Employees As of December 31, 2015 , we had 572 employees.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements, and we have never experienced a work stoppage.
1094392_16_ITEM1_P64_S2	We believe our employee relations are good.

1094392_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Risks Related to Rudolph Our operating results have varied, and will likely continue to vary significantly, from quarter to quarter in the future, causing volatility in our stock price Our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and will likely continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, causing volatility in our stock price.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Some of the factors that may influence our operating results and subject our stock to extreme price and volume fluctuations include:
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	the levels of our fixed expenses, including research and development costs associated with product development, relative to our revenue levels.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In light of these factors and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Moreover, many of our expenses are fixed in the short-term which, together with the need for continued investment in research and development, marketing and customer support, limits our ability to reduce expenses quickly.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	As a result, declines in net sales could harm our business and the price of our common stock could substantially decline.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our largest customers account for a significant portion of our revenues, and our revenues and cash flows could significantly decline if one or more of these customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems or they delayed or canceled a large order Sales to end user customers that individually represent at least five percent of our revenues typically account for, in the aggregate, a considerable amount of our revenues.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We operate in the highly concentrated, capital-intensive semiconductor device manufacturing industry.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Historically, a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers, and this trend is expected to continue.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	If any of our key customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems in the future, or if a large order were delayed or canceled, our revenues and cash flows could significantly decline.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	We expect that we will continue to depend on a small number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenues.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P3_S4	In addition, as large semiconductor device manufacturers seek to establish closer relationships with their suppliers, we expect that our customer base will become even more concentrated.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Our customers may be unable to pay us for our products and services Our customers include some companies that may from time to time encounter financial difficulties, especially in light of the current economic environment and the difficulties in the credit markets.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P3_S6	If a customer s financial difficulties become severe, the customer may be unwilling or unable to pay our invoices in the ordinary course of business, which could adversely affect collections of both our accounts receivable balance and unbilled services.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P3_S7	The bankruptcy of a customer with a substantial account receivable could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P3_S8	In addition, if a customer declares bankruptcy after paying us certain invoices, a court may determine that we are not properly entitled to that payment and may require repayment of some or all of the amount we received, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P3_S9	Variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our systems may cause fluctuations in our operating results, which could cause our stock price to decline Variations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our revenues and cash flows, and consequently, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, to fluctuate widely from period to period.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P3_S10	This variation could cause our stock price to decline.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P3_S11	Our customers generally take a long time to evaluate our inspection and/or film metrology systems and many people are involved in the evaluation process.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P3_S12	We expend significant resources educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our systems in the semiconductor fabrication process.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P3_S13	The length of time it takes for us to make a sale depends upon many factors including, but not limited to:
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	the quality and sophistication of the customer s current metrology, inspection or lithography equipment.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Because of the number of factors influencing the sales process, the period between our initial contact with a customer and the time when we recognize revenue from that customer and receive payment, if ever, varies widely in length.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our sales cycles, including the time it takes for us to build a product to customer specifications after receiving an order to the time we recognize revenue, typically range from six to twenty-four months.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Sometimes our sales cycles can be much longer, particularly with customers in Japan.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	During these cycles, we commit substantial resources to our sales efforts in advance of receiving any revenue, and we may never receive any revenue from a customer despite our sales efforts.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P5_S4	If we do make a sale, our customers often purchase only one of our systems, and then evaluate its performance for a lengthy period before purchasing any more of our systems.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P5_S5	The number of additional products a customer purchases, if any, depends on many factors, including the customer s capacity requirements.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P5_S6	The period between a customer s initial purchase and any subsequent purchases can vary from six months to a year or longer, and variations in the length of this period could cause further fluctuations in our operating results and possibly in our stock price.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Most of our revenues have been derived from customers outside of the United States subjecting us to operational, financial and political risks, such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs, political and economic instability, outbreaks of hostilities, and difficulties in managing foreign sales representatives and foreign branch operations as well as risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations Due to the significant level of our international sales, we are subject to a number of material risks, including: Compliance with foreign laws.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our business is subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally, including compliance with, inconsistencies among, and unexpected changes in, a wide variety of foreign laws and regulatory environments with which we are not familiar, including, among other issues, with respect to employees, protection of our intellectual property, and a wide variety of operational regulations and trade and export controls under domestic, foreign, and international law.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including tariffs and other market barriers.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The semiconductor device industry is a high-visibility industry in many of the European and Asian countries in which we sell our products.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Because the governments of these countries have provided extensive financial support to our semiconductor device manufacturing customers in these countries, we believe that our customers could be disproportionately affected by any trade embargoes, excise taxes or other restrictions imposed by their governments on trade with United States companies such as ourselves.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Any restrictions of these types could result in a reduction in our sales to customers in these countries.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We are subject to various global risks related to political and economic instabilities in countries in which we derive sales.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If terrorist activities, armed conflict, civil or military unrest or political instability occurs outside of the U.S., these events may result in reduced demand for our products.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	There is considerable political instability in Taiwan related to its disputes with China and in South Korea related to its disputes with North Korea.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In addition, several Asian countries, particularly Japan, have experienced significant economic instability.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	An outbreak of hostilities or other political upheaval in China, Taiwan or South Korea, or an economic downturn in Japan or other countries, would likely harm the operations of our customers in these countries.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The effect of these types of events on our revenues and cash flows could be material because we derive substantial revenues from sales to semiconductor device foundries in Taiwan such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd., from memory chip manufacturers in South Korea such as Samsung, and from semiconductor device manufacturers in Japan such as Toshiba.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign branch operations.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	During periods of tension between the governments of the United States and certain other countries, it is often difficult for United States companies such as ourselves to staff and manage operations in such countries.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Language and other cultural differences may also inhibit our sales and marketing efforts and create internal communication problems among our U.S. and foreign research and development teams, increasing the difficulty of managing multiple, remote locations performing various development, quality assurance, and yield ramp analysis projects.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Currency fluctuations as compared to the U.S. Dollar.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	A substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	As a result, if the dollar rises in value in relation to foreign currencies, our systems will become more expensive to customers outside the United States and less competitive with systems produced by competitors outside the United States.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	These conditions could negatively impact our international sales.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Foreign sales also expose us to collection risk in the event it becomes more expensive for our foreign customers to convert their local currencies into U.S. dollars.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Additionally, in the event a larger portion of our revenue becomes denominated in foreign currencies, we would be subject to a potentially significant exchange rate risk.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P11_S6	If we deliver systems with defects, our credibility will be harmed and the sales and market acceptance of our systems will decrease Our systems are complex and have occasionally contained errors, defects and bugs when introduced.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing or general handling, and can have a major impact on device and process quality.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	When this occurs, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our systems could be harmed.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Further, if our systems contain errors, defects or bugs, computer viruses or malicious code as a result of cyber attacks to our computer networks, we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate these problems.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	could also lead to product liability as a result of product liability lawsuits against us or against our customers.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We have agreed to indemnify our customers under certain circumstances against liability arising from defects in our systems.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our product liability policy currently provides $2.0 million of aggregate coverage, with an overall umbrella limit of $20.0 million .
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	In the event of a successful product liability claim, we could be obligated to pay damages significantly in excess of our product liability insurance limits.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If we are not successful in developing new and enhanced products for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry, we will lose sales and market share to our competitors We operate in an industry that is highly competitive and subject to evolving industry standards, rapid technological changes, rapid changes in consumer demands and the rapid introduction of new, higher performance systems with shorter product life cycles.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	To be competitive in our demanding market, we must continually design, develop and introduce in a timely manner new lithography, inspection and metrology process control systems that meet the performance and price demands of semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We must also continue to refine our current systems so that they remain competitive.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We expect to continue to make significant investments in our research and development activities.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We may experience difficulties or delays in our development efforts with respect to new systems, and we may not ultimately be successful in our product enhancement efforts to improve and advance products or in responding effectively to technological change, as not all research and development activities result in viable commercial products.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S5	In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to develop new products for the most opportunistic new markets and applications.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Any significant delay in releasing new systems could cause our products to become obsolete, adversely affect our reputation, give a competitor a first-to-market advantage or cause a competitor to achieve greater market share.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S7	In addition, new product offerings that are highly complex in terms of software or hardware may require application or service work such as bug fixing prior to acceptance, thereby delaying revenue recognition.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S8	If new products developed by us do not gain general market acceptance, we will be unable to generate revenues and recover our research and development costs Inspection, lithography and metrology product development is inherently risky because it is difficult to foresee developments in semiconductor device manufacturing technology, coordinate technical personnel, and identify and eliminate system design flaws.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S9	Further, our products are complex and often the applications to our customers businesses are unique.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S10	Any new systems we introduce may not achieve or sustain a significant degree of market acceptance and sales.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S11	We expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources developing new systems and refining our existing systems.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S12	In light of the long product development cycles inherent in our industry, these expenditures will be made well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenue from the sale of those systems.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S13	Our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market new systems are subject to a wide variety of challenges during the development cycle, including start-up bugs, design defects, and other matters that could delay introduction of these systems.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S14	In addition, since our customers are not obligated by long-term contracts to purchase our systems, our anticipated product orders may not materialize, or orders that are placed may be canceled.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S15	As a result, if we do not achieve market acceptance of new products, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows to recover our research and development costs and our market share, revenue, operating results or stock price would be negatively impacted.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S16	Even if we are able to develop new products that gain market acceptance, sales of these new products could impair our ability to sell existing products Competition from our new systems could have a negative effect on sales of our existing systems and the prices that we could charge for these systems.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S17	We may also divert sales and marketing resources from our current systems in order to successfully launch and promote our new or next generation systems.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S18	This diversion of resources could have a further negative effect on sales of our current systems and the value of inventory.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	If our relationships with our large customers deteriorate, our product development activities could be adversely affected The success of our product development efforts depends on our ability to anticipate market trends and the price, performance and functionality requirements of semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In order to anticipate these trends and ensure that critical development projects proceed in a coordinated manner, we must continue to collaborate closely with our largest customers.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Our relationships with these and other customers provide us with access to valuable information regarding trends in the semiconductor device industry, which enables us to better plan our product development activities.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If our current relationships with our large customers are impaired, or if we are unable to develop similar collaborative relationships with important customers in the future, our product development activities could be adversely affected.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Our ability to reduce costs is limited by our ongoing need to invest in research and development and to provide customer support activities Our industry is characterized by the need for continual investment in research and development as well as customer service and support.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P15_S5	As a result, our operating results could be materially affected if operating costs associated with our research and development as well as customer support activities increase in the future or we are unable to reduce those activities.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P15_S6	We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property and, therefore, lose our competitive advantage Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology for our principal product families, and we rely, in part, on patent and trade secret law and confidentiality agreements to protect that technology.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P15_S7	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it will give our competitors a significant advantage.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P15_S8	We own or have licensed a number of patents relating to our transparent and opaque thin film metrology, lithography and macro-defect inspection systems, and have filed applications for additional patents.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P15_S9	Any of our pending patent applications may be rejected, and we may be unable to develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable in the future.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P15_S10	In addition, the patents that we do own or that have been issued or licensed to us may not provide us with competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P15_S11	Further, third parties may also design around these patents.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In addition to patent protection, we rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and technology.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and other third parties.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Even though these agreements are in place there can be no assurances that trade secrets and proprietary information will not be disclosed, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, or that we can fully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Violations by others of our confidentiality agreements and the loss of employees who have specialized knowledge and expertise could harm our competitive position and cause our sales and operating results to decline as a result of increased competition.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Costly and time-consuming litigation might be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection might adversely affect our ability to continue our research or bring products to market.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Protection of our intellectual property rights, or the efforts of third parties to enforce their own intellectual property rights against us, may result in costly and time-consuming litigation, substantial damages, lost product sales and/or the loss of important intellectual property rights We may be required to initiate litigation in order to enforce any patents issued to or licensed by us, or to determine the scope or validity of a third party s patent or other proprietary rights.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Any litigation, regardless of outcome, could be expensive and time consuming, and could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to re-engineer our products or obtain expensive licenses from third parties.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P16_S7	There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P16_S8	In addition, our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	asserting that our products or systems infringe, or may infringe, the proprietary rights of these third parties.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	These claims of infringement may lead to protracted and costly litigation, which could require us to pay substantial damages or have the sale of our products or systems stopped by an injunction.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Infringement claims could also cause product or system delays or require us to redesign our products or systems, and these delays could result in the loss of substantial revenues.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We may also be required to obtain a license from the third party or cease activities utilizing the third party s proprietary rights.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We may not be able to enter into such a license or such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Accordingly, the loss of important intellectual property rights could hinder our ability to sell our systems, or make the sale of these systems more expensive.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P17_S6	For additional information regarding recent patent litigation, see Item 3.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in certain foreign countries, where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the United States The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement abroad.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	For example, Taiwan is not a signatory of the Patent Cooperation Treaty, which is designed to specify rules and methods for defending intellectual property internationally.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The publication of a patent in Taiwan prior to the filing of a patent in Taiwan would invalidate the ability of a company to obtain a patent in Taiwan.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Similarly, in contrast to the United States where the contents of patents remain confidential during the patent application process, in Taiwan the contents of a patent are published upon filing which provides competitors an advance view of the contents of a patent application prior to the establishment of patent rights.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Consequently, there is a risk that we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights in certain foreign countries.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P18_S5	If this occurs, it would be easier for our competitors to develop and sell competing products in these countries.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Some of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, and increased competition could impair sales of our products or cause us to reduce our prices The market for semiconductor capital equipment is highly competitive.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P18_S7	We face substantial competition from established companies in each of the markets we serve.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P18_S8	We principally compete with KLA-Tencor, Camtek and Ultratech.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P18_S9	We compete to a lesser extent with companies such as Nanometrics, Nova Measurement Instruments and Nikon.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P18_S10	Each of our products also competes with products that use different metrology, inspection or lithography techniques.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P18_S11	Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, broader product offerings and service capabilities and larger installed customer bases than we do.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P18_S12	As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or market developments by devoting greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products, which, in turn, could impair sales of our products.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P18_S13	Further, there may be significant merger and acquisition activity among our competitors and potential competitors, which, in turn, may provide them with a competitive advantage over us by enabling them to rapidly expand their product offerings and service capabilities to meet a broader range of customer needs.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Many of our customers and potential customers in the semiconductor device manufacturing industry are large companies that require global support and service for their semiconductor capital equipment.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We believe that our global support and service infrastructure is sufficient to meet the needs of our customers and potential customers.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	However, some of our competitors have more extensive infrastructures than we do, which could place us at a disadvantage when competing for the business of global semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Many of our competitors are investing heavily in the development of new systems that will compete directly with our systems.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P19_S4	We have from time to time selectively reduced prices on our systems in order to protect our market share, and competitive pressures may necessitate further price reductions.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P19_S5	We expect our competitors in each product area to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices and performance characteristics.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P19_S6	These product introductions would likely require us to decrease the prices of our systems and increase the level of discounts that we grant our customers.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Price reductions or lost sales as a result of these competitive pressures would reduce our total revenues and could adversely impact our financial results.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Because of the high cost of switching equipment vendors in our markets, it is sometimes difficult for us to win customers from our competitors even if our systems are superior to theirs We believe that once a semiconductor device manufacturer has selected one vendor s capital equipment for a production-line application, the manufacturer generally relies upon that capital equipment and, to the extent possible, subsequent generations of the same vendor s equipment, for the life of the application.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Once a vendor s equipment has been installed in a production line application, a semiconductor device manufacturer must often make substantial technical modifications and may experience production-line downtime in order to switch to another vendor s equipment.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Accordingly, unless our systems offer performance or cost advantages that outweigh a customer s expense of switching to our systems, it will be difficult for us to achieve significant sales to that manufacturer once it has selected another vendor s capital equipment for an application.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key executive management, engineering, sales and marketing, customer support, finance and manufacturing personnel.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P20_S4	The loss of any of these key personnel through resignations, retirement or other circumstances, each of whom would be extremely difficult to replace, could harm our business and operating results.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Although we have employment and noncompetition agreements with key members of our senior management team, these individuals or other key employees may still leave us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P20_S6	We do not have key person life insurance on any of our executives.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P20_S7	In addition, to support our future growth, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Competition for such personnel in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified employees.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P20_S9	We obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a limited group of suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenues We obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a limited group of suppliers and do not have long-term contracts with many of our suppliers.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P20_S10	Our dependence on limited source suppliers of components and our lack of long-term contracts with many of our suppliers exposes us to several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components, price increases, late deliveries and poor component quality.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P20_S11	Disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our systems, damage our customer relationships and reduce our sales.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	From time to time in the past, we have experienced temporary difficulties in receiving shipments from our suppliers.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The lead-time required for shipments of some of our components can be as long as six months.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, the lead time required to qualify new suppliers for lasers and certain optics could be as long as a year, and the lead time required to qualify new suppliers of other components could be as long as nine months.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	If we are unable to accurately predict our component needs, or if our component supply is disrupted, we may miss market opportunities by not being able to meet the demand for our systems.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Further, a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components or subassemblies could seriously harm our results of operations and cash flows.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility could have a material adverse effect on our revenues Our manufacturing processes are highly complex and require sophisticated and costly equipment and a specially designed facility.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	As a result, any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, or destruction of or damage as a result of a fire or any other reason, could seriously harm our ability to satisfy our customer order deadlines.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	If we cannot timely deliver our systems, our results from operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	gain unauthorized access, whether through malfeasance or error, either from within or outside of our organization, to our data or that of our customers or our customers customers which may be in our possession, and the unauthorized release, corruption or loss of the data, loss of the intellectual property, theft of the proprietary or licensed technology, whether ours, that of our customers or their customers, loss or damage to our data delivery systems, other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in our critical systems, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	It is possible that our business, financial and other systems could be compromised, which might not be noticed for some period of time.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks are evolving and unpredictable and we cannot guarantee that any risk prevention measures implemented will be successful.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	The occurrence of such an attack could lead to financial losses and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Our earnings could be negatively affected and our inventory levels could materially increase if we are unable to predict our inventory needs in an accurate and timely manner and adjust our orders for parts and subcomponents should our needs increase or decrease materially due to unexpected increases or decreases in demand for our products.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Any material increase in our inventories could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, while any material decrease in our ability to procure needed inventories could result in an inability to supply customer demand for our products, thus adversely affecting our revenues.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Our ability to fulfill our backlog may have an effect on our long term ability to procure contracts and fulfill current contracts Our ability to fulfill our backlog may be limited by our ability to devote sufficient financial and human capital resources and limited by available material supplies.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P23_S7	If we do not fulfill our backlog in a timely manner, we may experience delays in product delivery which would postpone receipt of revenue from those delayed deliveries.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P23_S8	Additionally, if we are consistently unable to fulfill our backlog, this may be a disincentive to customers to award large contracts to us in the future until they are comfortable that we can effectively manage our backlog.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P23_S9	We may choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves, and may be unable to complete these acquisitions or may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired business in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner Our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P23_S10	To this end, we have, from time to time, engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions, and from time to time acquiring one or more businesses, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P23_S11	We may choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products, technologies and/or services instead of developing them ourselves.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P23_S12	We may, however, face competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established companies with greater financial resources, making it more difficult for us to complete acquisitions.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P23_S13	We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from one or more acquisitions that we consummate.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P23_S14	Integrating any business, product technology or service we acquire could be expensive and time-consuming and/or disrupt our ongoing business.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P23_S15	Further, there are numerous risks associated with acquisitions and potential acquisitions, including but not limited to:
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	unexpected reduction of sales of existing products by new products.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such favorable terms or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations, including as a result of our incurrence of indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In order to finance any acquisitions, we might need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In that event, we could be forced to obtain financing on terms that are not favorable to us and, in the case of equity financing, that result in dilution to our stockholders.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In addition, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, amortization of intangible assets, write-down of other assets or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions and purchase accounting could harm our business and operating results.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	If we cannot effectively manage growth, our business may suffer Over the long-term, we intend to grow our business by increasing our sales efforts and completing strategic acquisitions.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P25_S4	To effectively manage growth, we must, among other things:
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	administer appropriate financial and administrative control procedures.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Growth of our business will likely place a significant strain on our management, financial, operational, technical, sales and administrative resources.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Any failure to effectively manage our growth may cause our business to suffer and our stock price to decline.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Changes in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect results As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Our future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the (1) applicable tax laws; (2) composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates; or (3) recoverability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P28_S3	In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P28_S4	We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, also recently released guidance covering various topics, including country-by-country reporting, definitional changes to permanent establishment and Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, or BEPS, an initiative that aims to standardize and modernize global tax policy.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Depending on the final form of guidance adopted by OECD members and legislation ultimately enacted, if any, there may be significant consequences for us due to our international business activities.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Turmoil or fluctuations in the credit markets and the financial services industry may negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity During recent years, global credit markets and the financial services industry have experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by tightening of the credit markets, weakening of the global economy and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States and other governments.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Adverse economic conditions, such as sustained periods of economic uncertainty or a crisis in the financial markets may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition if our ability to obtain credit from the capital financial markets or from trade creditors were to be impaired.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	customers ability to finance the purchase of systems from us or our suppliers ability to provide us with product, either of which may negatively impact our business and results of operations.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations Our sale of $60.0 million of 3.75% convertible senior notes on July 25, 2011 (the Notes ) resulted in debt, which is due July 15, 2016.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Our maintenance of indebtedness could have important consequences because:
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our ability to generate sufficient cash to pay our expenses and debt obligations, including the Notes, will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash to pay our debt obligations, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of our debt obligations, seek to refinance all or a portion of our debt obligations or obtain additional financing.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P32_S3	There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Failure to make a payment on our debt obligations, or to fail to satisfy one or more covenants under our debt agreements, could also result in acceleration of all of our debt obligations, including the Notes, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers On August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	These regulations require companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The first such report was filed with the SEC on May 29, 2014.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P33_S3	The implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, including our products.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P33_S4	In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P33_S6	In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our operating results are subject to significant variation due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor device industry.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor device manufacturers, which, in turn, depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In recent years, the industry has experienced significant downturns, generally in connection with declines in economic conditions.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	This cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and, thus, future expense levels.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P37_S3	If we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business could be seriously harmed.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Our future rate of growth is highly dependent on the development and growth of the market for microelectronic device inspection, lithography and metrology equipment We target our products to address the needs of microelectronic device manufacturers for defect inspection, metrology and lithography.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P37_S5	If for any reason the market for microelectronic device inspection, lithography or metrology equipment fails to grow in the long term, we may be unable to maintain current revenue levels in the short term and maintain our historical growth in the long term.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Growth in the inspection market is dependent to a large extent upon microelectronic manufacturers replacing manual inspection with automated inspection technology.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Growth in the metrology market is dependent to a large extent upon new chip designs and capacity expansion of microelectronic manufacturers.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Growth in the lithography market is dependent on the development of cost-effective packaging with high fine pitch redistribution layers (RDL), ultimately migrating to multi-die, large, form-factor packages.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P38_S3	There is no assurance that manufacturers will undertake these actions at the rate we expect.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Risks Related to our Stock Provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and/or delay, deter or prevent a change in control of our company Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board of Directors.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P38_S5	These provisions also limit the circumstances in which a premium can be paid for the common stock, and in which a proxy contest for control of our board may be initiated.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	the authority of our board, without stockholder approval, to adopt a stockholder rights plan.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Such a stockholder rights plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on June 27, 2005 and expired on June 28, 2015.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We are also entitled to avail ourselves of the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could inhibit changes in control of us.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our stock price is volatile The market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	From the beginning of 2009 through the end of 2015 , our stock price fluctuated between a high of $15.06 per share and a low of $1.95 per share.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Factors affecting our stock price may include:
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	the number of firms making a market in our common stock.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	In addition, the stock market has experienced periods of significant price and volume fluctuations.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	These fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high technology companies like ours.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Any such market fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	There are various risks related to the legal and regulatory environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business that may expose us to risk We are faced with various risks which may be associated with our compliance with existing, new, different, inconsistent or conflicting laws, regulations and rules enacted by governments and/or their regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate as well as rules and policies implemented at our customer sites.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	These laws, regulations, rules and policies could relate to any of an array of issues including, but not limited to, environmental, tax, intellectual property, trade secrets, product liability, contracts, antitrust, employment, securities, import/export and unfair competition.
1094392_16_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Should we fail to comply with or violate U.S. or foreign laws or regulations or customer policies, we could be subject to civil or criminal claims or proceedings that may result in monetary fines, penalties or other costs against us or our employees that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, customer relations and ability to conduct our business.
1094392_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal executive office building is located at 16 Jonspin Road in Wilmington, Massachusetts.
1094392_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own and lease facilities for corporate, engineering, manufacturing, sales and service related purposes in the United States and six other countries China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Scotland.
1094392_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	The following table indicates the location, the general purpose and the square footage of our principal facilities.
1094392_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	The expiration years of the leases covering the leased facilities are also indicated.
1094392_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	We also lease office space for other smaller sales and service offices in several locations throughout the world.
1094392_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our existing facilities and capital equipment are adequate to meet our current requirements, and that suitable additional or substitute space is available on commercially reasonable terms if needed.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	The following reflects an overview of the material activities with regard to these matters.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P1_S0	Integrated Technology Corporation v. Rudolph Technologies, Inc., No. CV-06-2182 (PHX-ROS) : As previously disclosed, in December 2007, we completed the acquisition of specific assets and liabilities of the semiconductor division of Applied Precision LLC ( Applied ).
1094392_16_ITEM3_P1_S1	As a result of the acquisition, we assumed certain liabilities of Applied including a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court, District of Arizona, by Integrated Technology Corporation ( ITC ) which alleged Applied s PrecisionPoint , PrecisionWoRx and ProbeWoRx products infringed an ITC patent.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P1_S2	Prior to trial, the District Court ruled that such products sold prior to August of 2007 (the pre-August 2007 tools ) infringed the ITC patent.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P1_S3	At trial in December of 2011, a trial verdict was rendered in which the jury found that while our products manufactured after August of 2007 (the post-August 2007 tools ) did not literally infringe ITC s patent, the products were found to infringe under a rule known as the doctrine of equivalents, a legal principle which expands the language of patent claims to encompass products or processes which may otherwise be found not to literally infringe the patent.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P1_S4	The jury awarded $15.5 million to ITC in damages for sales made during the years 2000-2011, of which approximately one-half related to sales for pre-August 2007 tools.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P1_S5	The jury found that for the sales of the post-August 2007 tools, the infringement was willful.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P1_S6	On July 23, 2012, the District Court issued an Order which affirmed the jury s award, applied treble damages to the portion of the jury award related to post-August 2007 tool sales and granted ITC s motion for attorney s fees and prejudgment interest on the verdict and attorney s fees.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P1_S7	At that time, the District Court also enjoined us from future infringement of the ITC patent and from selling or supplying the applicable products with the applicable features from or into the United States.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P1_S8	We appealed the injunction, the District Court Order and the damages assessment.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P1_S9	In October 2012, the injunction was stayed by the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals and thereafter in June of 2013, the patent expired.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P1_S10	On November 4, 2013, the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals issued a ruling which reversed the judgment of infringement against all post-August 2007 tools, reversed the finding of willfulness, vacated the treble damages award, vacated the award of attorney s fees and costs, remanded the issue back to the District Court for further review, and affirmed the award of damages and interest for the pre-August 2007 tools.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P1_S11	As a result, the matter is resolved with regard to the alleged infringement of the post-August 2007 tools.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P1_S12	With regard to the damages assessment against the pre-August 2007 tools, on March 4, 2014, we filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court to appeal the basis of the Federal Court of Appeals decision affirming the damages award for the pre-August 2007 tools.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P1_S13	On June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court denied our Petition and as a result, on July 22, 2014, we paid to ITC $10.6 million which represented only the damages and interest portion of the judgment.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P1_S14	Since the patent expired in June of 2013 and payment of the judgment has been made, this matter is fully resolved with the sole exception of the issue of the remanded attorney s fees.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P1_S15	On August 8, 2014, the District Court issued an order for setting the attorney s fees award at $3.3 million which we appealed to the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals on September 5, 2014.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P1_S16	A hearing regarding our appeal was held on October 6, 2015 and thereafter, the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals issued a ruling that the award was improperly established, vacated the amount of the award and remanded the matter back to the District Court for a determination of a proper fee award.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P1_S17	We believe that we have meritorious defenses regarding this issue and intend to continue to vigorously prosecute the matter.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P2_S0	The $3.3 million is held in escrow and is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P2_S1	The corresponding liability is recorded under the caption, Other current liabilities, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P2_S2	We expect this to be the maximum liability reasonably possible for the attorney s fees, excluding interest, for this lawsuit with respect to both the pre-August 2007 and post-2007 August tools.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P3_S0	August Technology Corporation and Rudolph Technologies, Inc. v. Camtek, Ltd., No. 05-CV-01396 (JRT/FLN) :
1094392_16_ITEM3_P4_S0	Our patent infringement suit against Camtek, Ltd., of Migdal Hamek, Israel, concerning our proprietary continuous scan wafer inspection technology, was initially brought in 2005 by August Technology prior to its merger with us.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P5_S0	On August 22, 2011 the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals issued a decision in which it affirmed multiple rulings from trial at the District Court level including (i) finding our U.S.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P5_S1	Patent No. 6,826,298 valid, (ii) the part of the infringement ruling based on the finding that Camtek s Falcon product strobes based on velocity, and (iii) the dismissal of Camtek s claim against us for inequitable conduct against the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P5_S2	The court did, however, revise one claim construction ruling made by the District Court in the original case.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P6_S0	On March 31, 2014, the District Court ruled in our favor, finding that Camtek s Falcon tools continue to infringe our patent even under the revised claim construction of the patent, obviating the need for the limited trial.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P6_S1	On February 9, 2015, the District Court issued an Order granting our Motion for Final Judgment, reinstating the original damages and applying prejudgment interest for a total award of $14.5 million.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P6_S2	In addition, the District Court issued a permanent injunction against Camtek from making, using, selling and offering to sell any of its Falcon machines and any machines that are colorable imitations thereof in the United States, intended for sale and use within the United States, until the expiration of the 6,298 patent [projected to be in 2020].
1094392_16_ITEM3_P6_S3	While, in March of 2015, Camtek filed an appeal with the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals challenging the District Court s ruling the Appeals Court denied Camtek's appeal on February 3, 2016, affirming both the infringement ruling and the damages and interest totaling approximately $14.6 million assessed against Camtek by the District Court.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P7_S0	August Technology Corporation and Rudolph Technologies, Inc. v. Camtek, Ltd., No. 10-CV-2202 (MJD/FLN) :
1094392_16_ITEM3_P8_S0	A lawsuit against Camtek was filed by us in 2011 alleging infringement of its U.S. Patent No. 7,729,528 which is also related to our proprietary continuous scan wafer inspection technology.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P8_S1	Camtek filed an inter partes reexamination petition with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on January 19, 2012 asserting that certain claims of the patent are unpatentable.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P8_S2	The reexamination of the subject patent is ongoing at this time.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P8_S3	During the pendency of the reexamination process, the parties have stipulated that the lawsuit be stayed pending resolution of Camtek s petition.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P9_S0	Rudolph Technologies, Inc. v. Camtek, Ltd., No. 15-CV-1246 (ADM/BRT) : On March 12, 2015, we filed and served on Camtek a complaint asserting infringement of Rudolph 6,298 patent by Camtek s Eagle product with the U.S. District Court in Minnesota.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P9_S1	On April 21, 2015, we filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction to enjoin Camtek s sale of the Eagle device in the United States which is currently pending.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P10_S0	On or about April 20, 2015, Camtek filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey seeking a declaratory judgment challenging the jurisdiction and venue of the Minnesota District Court and seeking to have the New Jersey District Court find that the 6,298 patent is not infringed and, in the alternative, that the 6,298 patent is invalid.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P10_S1	On August 26, 2015, the U.S. District Court in Minnesota ruled that Minnesota jurisdiction was appropriate for this matter while at the same time denying our Motion for Preliminary Injunction.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P10_S2	Camtek s complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey was subsequently dismissed.
1094392_16_ITEM3_P10_S3	This matter is currently ongoing in the U.S. District Court in Minnesota.

1094392_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	The graph assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2010 in the Company s common stock in each index, and that all dividends were reinvested.
1094392_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	No cash dividends have been declared or paid on the Company s common stock.
1094392_16_ITEM5_P1_S2	Stockholder returns over the indicated period should not be considered indicative of future stockholder returns.
1094392_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sale prices per share of our common stock as reported on the NYSE.
1094392_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	As of February 12, 2016 , there were 69 stockholders of record of our common stock and approximately 7,157 beneficial stockholders.
1094392_16_ITEM5_P3_S1	The closing market value of our common stock on February 12, 2016 was $11.52 per share.
1094392_16_ITEM5_P3_S2	We have never declared or paid a cash dividend on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1094392_16_ITEM5_P3_S3	We currently intend to retain our earnings, if any, for the development of our business and the share repurchase of our common stock.
1094392_16_ITEM5_P3_S4	Additionally, covenants in the indenture governing the Notes restrict our ability to declare or pay cash dividends.
1094392_16_ITEM5_P3_S5	The declaration of any future dividends by us is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements as well as any other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
1094392_16_ITEM5_P3_S6	In January 2015, the Board of Directors increased our authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock by approximately an additional 1.4 million shares to replenish the shares purchased through December 31, 2014, bringing the total repurchase authorization to 3.0 million shares as of such date.
1094392_16_ITEM5_P3_S7	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 , we repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock.
1094392_16_ITEM5_P3_S8	At December 31, 2015 , there were 1.3 million shares available for future stock repurchases under this repurchase authorization.
1094392_16_ITEM5_P3_S9	Shares of common stock purchased under the share repurchase authorization are retired.
1094392_16_ITEM5_P3_S10	For further information, see Note 16 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1094392_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	In addition to the our share repurchase program, we withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards and stock option exercises under the Company s equity incentive program.
1094392_16_ITEM5_P4_S1	During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we withheld one thousand and 0.2 million shares through net share settlements, respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM5_P4_S2	For the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2015 net share settlements cost ten thousand and $1.9 million, respectively.

1094392_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1094392_16_ITEM6_P1_S1	The balance sheet data as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 set forth below were derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1094392_16_ITEM6_P1_S2	The balance sheet data as of 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , and the statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were derived from our audited consolidated financial statements not included herein.
1094392_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	(1) Effective December 31, 2015, we early adopted provisions prescribed by the Financial Account Standards Board (FASB) in Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.
1094392_16_ITEM6_P2_S1	Consequently, we reclassified net current deferred income tax assets to net long term deferred income tax assets for each period presented.
1094392_16_ITEM6_P2_S2	(2) Working capital data for 2011 through 2014 reflect reclassifications of a portion of deferred revenue to other non-current liabilities.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview We are a worldwide leader in the design, development, manufacture and support of process control, defect inspection and metrology, advanced packaging lithography, and data analysis systems and software used by microelectronic device manufacturers.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	We provide process and yield management solutions used in both wafer processing and final manufacturing through a family of standalone systems for macro-defect inspection, lithography, probe card test and analysis, and transparent and opaque thin film measurements.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	All Rudolph systems feature sophisticated software and production-worthy automation.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	Rudolph systems are backed by worldwide customer support.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	In September 2015, we announced that we purchased Stella Alliance, LLC, a Massachusetts-based semiconductor inspection technology intellectual property (IP) portfolio company.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	The acquired intellectual property portfolio is being integrated into our process control group.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	The impact of the acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	Rudolph s business is affected by the annual spending patterns of our customers on semiconductor capital equipment.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	The amount that our customers devote to capital equipment spending depends on a number of factors, including general worldwide economic conditions as well as other economic drivers such as personal computer, tablet, cell phone, other personal electronic devices and automotive sales.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	Current forecasts by industry analysts for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry projects a year-over-year capital spending of flat to down 5% for 2016.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our revenues and profitability tend to follow the trends of certain segments within the semiconductor market.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	We monitor capital equipment spending through announced capital spending plans by our customers and monthly-published industry data such as the book-to-bill ratio.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	The book-to-bill ratio is a 3-month running statistic that compares bookings or orders placed with capital equipment suppliers to billings or shipments.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	A book-to-bill ratio above 1.0 shows that semiconductor device equipment manufacturers are ordering equipment at a pace that exceeds the equipment suppliers shipments for the period.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P3_S4	The three month rolling average North American semiconductor equipment book-to-bill ratio was 1.0 for the month of December 2015 , decreasing from the September 2015 book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 .
1094392_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Historically, a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers, and we expect this trend to continue.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , sales to customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for 23.3% , 23.9% , and 41.6% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	We do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products, and they could cease purchasing products from us at any time.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	A delay in purchase or cancellation by any of our large customers could cause quarterly revenues to vary significantly.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	In addition, during a given quarter, a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P5_S3	The following table presents the average selling price range for our systems in 2015 .
1094392_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	A significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customers outside of the United States.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	A substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in U.S dollars.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	We expect that revenues generated from customers outside of the United States will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P6_S3	The sales cycle for our systems typically ranges from six to twenty-four months, and can be longer when our customers are evaluating new technology.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P6_S4	Due to the length of these cycles, we invest significantly in research and development and sales and marketing in advance of generating revenues related to these investments.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our statements of operations data as percentages of our revenues.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our results of operations are reported as one business segment.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Results of Operations 2015 , 2014 and 2013 Revenues.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	Our revenues are derived from the sale of our systems, services, spare parts and software licensing.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	Our revenues were $221.7 million , $181.2 million and $176.2 million for the years ended 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P8_S3	This represents an increase of 22.3% from 2014 to 2015 and an increase of 2.8% from 2013 to 2014 .
1094392_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	The increase in revenue from, 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to increased capital spending by back-end semiconductor manufacturers and the sale of a flat panel display unit in 2014.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	The following table lists, for the periods indicated, the different sources of our revenues in dollars (thousands) and as percentages of our total revenues:
1094392_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Total systems and software revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to increased demand for our products in advanced packaging and front-end systems.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	The year-over-year increases in inspection, metrology and lithography systems revenue totaled $31.1 million , $1.3 million and $3.4 million , respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	The increase in systems revenue was attributed to a greater number of inspection and lithography units sold.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P10_S3	The average selling price of similarly configured systems has been consistent and therefore did not have a material impact on our revenue for the same period.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Licensing revenue from the data analysis and review software product category increased $3.2 million primarily due to increased licensing revenue from our process control software.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	Systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to 66% of total revenue for 2015 compared to 61% of total revenue for 2014 .
1094392_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	The year-over-year increase in parts and service revenues in absolute dollars from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to increased spending by our customers on repairs of existing systems.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P11_S3	Parts and services revenues are generated from part sales, maintenance service contracts, system upgrades, as well as time and material billable service calls.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P11_S4	Total systems and software revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 due to an increase in licensing and lithography revenue.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P11_S5	There was a year-over-year increase in lithography revenue of $2.6 million , however, the number of units sold decreased slightly.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P11_S6	Licensing revenue from the data analysis and review software product category increased $6.1 million primarily in increased licensing revenue from our process control software.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P11_S7	The year-over-year increase in system and software revenue was partially offset by a decrease in inspection systems revenue of $1.3 million , however, there was a slight increase in the number of inspection units sold.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P11_S8	There was a decrease in metrology revenue of $1.9 million due to a decrease in demand for metrology systems.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P11_S9	Systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to 61% of total revenue for 2014 compared to 64% of total revenue for 2013 .
1094392_16_ITEM7_P11_S10	The year-over-year increase in parts and service revenues in absolute dollars from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to increased spending by our customers on repairs of existing systems.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P11_S11	Parts and services revenues are generated from part sales, maintenance service contracts, system upgrades, as well as time and material billable service calls.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P11_S12	Deferred revenues of $6.4 million were recorded in Current liabilities and $1.2 million were recorded in Other non-current liabilities at December 31, 2015 .
1094392_16_ITEM7_P11_S13	Deferred revenue primarily consisted of $5.2 million for deferred maintenance agreements and $2.4 million for outstanding deliverables.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P11_S14	Our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including manufacturing efficiencies, provision for excess and obsolete inventory, pricing by competitors or suppliers, new product introductions, production volume, customization and reconfiguration of systems, international and domestic sales mix, and parts and service margins.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P11_S15	Our gross profit was $119.4 million , $95.5 million and $90.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	to 2015 was primarily due to an increase in product and software sales volume and product mix.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to higher volume of software sales as well as product mix.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	Operating Expenses Our operating expenses consist of:
1094392_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	The process control defect inspection and metrology, advanced packaging lithography, and data analyisis systems and software market is characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	We believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements of existing products, including the transition to copper and low-k dielectrics, wafer level packaging, the continuous shrinkage in critical dimensions, and the evolution of ultra-thin gate process control, is critical to our success.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our technical, management and financial resources to research and development programs.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	Research and development expenditures consist primarily of salaries and related expenses of employees engaged in research, design and development activities.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P13_S4	They also include consulting fees, the cost of related supplies and legal costs to defend our patents.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P13_S5	Our research and development expense was $41.2 million , $40.6 million and $40.0 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P13_S6	The year-over-year dollar increase from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to increased compensation, litigation and project costs.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P13_S7	The year-over-year dollar increase from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to charges related to our restructuring plan announced in November 2014.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P13_S8	We continue to maintain our commitment to investing in new product development and enhancement to existing products.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs for sales, marketing, and general administrative personnel, as well as commissions and other non-personnel related expenses.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	Our selling, general and administrative expense was $43.2 million , $53.8 million and $41.5 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	In 2014 there was a significant increase to litigation expenses related to the final judgment awarded to Integrated Technology Corporation ( ITC ).
1094392_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	For more information on the ITC litigation, See Part I Item 3 of this Form 10-K. There were also restructuring charges in 2014 due primarily to the closure of our facility in Mainz, Germany.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P14_S4	These increased charges in 2014 were primarily responsible for the year-over-year decrease in selling, general and administrative expense from 2014 to 2015, as well as the year-over-year increase from 2013 to 2014.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P14_S5	The changes were offset slightly by higher share based compensation expenses in 2015 and 2014 .
1094392_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Amortization of Identifiable Intangible Assets .
1094392_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	Amortization of identifiable intangible assets was $2.1 million , $2.4 million and $2.6 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	The year-over-year decreases in amortization expense from 2013 to 2015 were due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the periods.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P15_S3	The decrease in 2015 was slightly offset by an increase in amortization for intangibles acquired during the year.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P15_S4	In 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , net interest expense was $5.7 million , $5.3 million and $5.1 million , respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P15_S5	The year-over-year increase in net interest expense from 2013 to 2015 was primarily due to increased amortization of the interest discount related to the convertible senior notes.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P15_S6	The following table provides details of income tax (dollars in millions):
1094392_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	The income tax provision differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 35% for 2015, primarily due to research and development credits, section 199 manufacturing deduction and a decrease in our valuation allowance, partially offset by taxes accrued in foreign jurisdictions.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	The income tax benefit differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 35% for 2014, primarily due to an increase in our valuation allowance and taxes accrued in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by research and development tax credits.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	The income tax benefit differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 35% for 2013, primarily from research and development tax credits which were not available in 2012 as a result of legislation, foreign tax credits, and the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits, offset by $1.3 million of expense related to a correction of prior year income tax balances recognized in the fourth quarter of 2013.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	The correction of the prior year income tax balance was not considered material to the prior year financial statements.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	As discussed in Part I, Item 3.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	Legal Proceedings , we are subject to legal proceedings and claims, which include, among other things, our on-going litigation with ITC in a patent infringement action related to the predictive scrub feature of our PrecisionPoint , PrecisionWoRx and ProbeWoRx products in which we were the defendants.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	See Part I, Item 3 for a discussion of this action and the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals ruling reversing the finding of infringement against products sold after August of 2007 and its order of other relief in this matter.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P18_S3	The U.S. Federal Court of Appeals did affirm the jury s finding of damages against us related to products sold prior to August of 2007 for which we ultimately paid $10.6 million to ITC to satisfy the damages award.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P18_S4	The District Court subsequently issued an order awarding ITC $3.3 million in attorney s fees which we are in the process of pursuing an appeal.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P18_S5	In an adverse judgment against us in this matter, the amount identified by the Court will not have a material impact on our results of operations and will also not have a material impact on our liquidity and financial condition.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2015 , we had $161.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $197.0 million in working capital.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	At December 31, 2014 , our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $157.0 million , while working capital amounted to $246.4 million .
1094392_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Typically during periods of revenue growth, changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a use of cash as we incur costs and expend cash in advance of receiving cash from our customers.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	Similarly, during periods of declining revenue, changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a source of cash as inventory purchases decline and revenue from prior periods is collected.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P20_S2	Net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 totaled $33.8 million , $4.3 million and $6.1 million , respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P20_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2015 , cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, of $42.9 million , an increase in accounts payable of $2.3 million , an increase in income tax payable of $2.6 million , an increase in other liabilities of $3.5 million and an a decrease in prepaid expenses and other of $1.0 million , partially offset by an increase in inventory of $12.5 million , an increase in accounts receivable of $4.3 million , and a decrease in deferred revenue of $1.5 million .
1094392_16_ITEM7_P20_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2014 , cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net loss, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, of $12.4 million , and an increase in accounts payable of $3.8 million , a decrease in income taxes receivable of $1.2 million , and a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.1 million , partially offset by an increase in inventories of $9.4 million , an increase in prepaid expenses and other of $4.7 million , an increase in other liabilities of $0.5 million , and a decrease in deferred revenue of $0.4 million .
1094392_16_ITEM7_P20_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, of $19.8 million , a decrease in account receivable of $2.6 million , and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.4 million , partially offset by an increase in inventory of $6.8 million , a decrease in other liabilities of $3.8 million , an increase in income taxes receivable of $4.6 million , a decrease in deferred revenue of $1.7 million , and a decrease in accounts payable of $0.9 million .
1094392_16_ITEM7_P20_S6	Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 totaled $9.1 million , $28.5 million and $30.0 million , respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P20_S7	During the year ended December 31, 2015 , net cash used by investing activities included purchases of marketable securities of $237.1 million , capital expenditures of $3.4 million , and purchase of intangible assets of $2.7 million , which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $234.1 million .
1094392_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	activities included purchases of marketable securities of $243.7 million , and capital expenditures of $2.1 million , which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $217.2 million .
1094392_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , net cash used by investing activities included purchases of marketable securities of $119.1 million , capital expenditures of $4.9 million , and acquisition costs for business combinations of $3.4 million , which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $97.3 million .
1094392_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	Capital expenditures over the next twelve months are expected to be approximately $5.0 million to $7.0 million .
1094392_16_ITEM7_P21_S3	Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(23.0) million , $(12.7) million and $1.4 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P21_S4	In the 2015 , financing activities primarily included the purchase of shares under the share repurchase authorization of $20.7 million and tax payments related to shares withheld for share based compensation plans.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P21_S5	In 2014, financing activities primarily included the purchase of shares under the share repurchase authorization of $12.8 million .
1094392_16_ITEM7_P21_S6	In 2013 net cash provided by financing activities comprised proceeds received from sales of shares through share-based compensation plans and tax benefit from share-based compensation plans.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	From time to time we evaluate whether to acquire new or complementary businesses, products and/or technologies.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	We may fund all or a portion of the purchase price of these acquisitions in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	In July 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 3.0 million shares of our common stock with no established end date.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P22_S3	The authorization allows for repurchases to be made in the open market or through negotiated transactions from time to time.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P22_S4	In January 2015, our Board of Directors increased the Company's authorization to repurchase shares of its common stock by approximately an additional 1.4 million shares to replenish the shares purchased through December 31, 2014, bringing the total repurchase authorization back to 3.0 million shares as of such date.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P22_S5	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 , the Company repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P22_S6	At December 31, 2015 , there were 1.3 million shares available for future stock repurchases under this repurchase authorization.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P22_S7	Shares of common stock purchased under the share repurchase authorization are retired.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P22_S8	For further information, see Note 16 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	On July 25, 2011, we issued $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2016 (the Notes ) at par.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	The Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year at an annual rate of 3.75% and will mature on July 15, 2016, unless earlier converted or repurchased.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P23_S2	The Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, based on an initial conversion rate of 77.241 shares of Company common stock per $1 thousand principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $12.95 per share.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we purchased a convertible note hedge for $14.5 million and sold a warrant for $7.0 million.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	The separate convertible note hedge and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the Notes.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into a credit agreement with Credit Suisse providing for a $60.0 million committed secured revolving line of credit.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	The agreement will expire on October 31, 2016.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	We have not utilized the credit agreement to date.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P25_S3	Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and amount of our revenues and our investment decisions, which will affect our ability to generate additional cash.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P25_S4	We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs for the next twelve months.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P25_S5	Thereafter, if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements, we may seek additional funding through bank borrowings, sales of securities or other means.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P25_S6	There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us or at all.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 , and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	This table excludes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits that totaled approximately $5.2 million at December 31, 2015 .
1094392_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	We are currently unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount or periods when cash settlement of this liability may occur.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	The Company does not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity and capital resources.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Critical Accounting Policies Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	We review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P28_S3	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, business acquisitions, intangible assets, share-based payments, income taxes and warranty obligations.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P28_S4	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P28_S5	Results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P28_S6	These estimates and judgments are regularly reviewed by management on an ongoing basis at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P28_S7	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Revenue is recognized provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	Revenue recognition generally results at the following points: (1) for all transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment for all products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment; the portion of revenue associated with certain installation-related tasks is deferred, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation-related tasks; (2) for products that have not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized at customer technical acceptance; (3) for transactions with multiple elements, such as sales of products that include software and services, the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred using the relative selling price method utilizing vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) or estimated sales prices ( ESP ) until delivery of the deferred elements.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Third-party evidence is not typically used to determine selling prices as to limited availability of reliable competitor products selling prices.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	The ESP is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, gross margin objectives, internal costs and competitor pricing strategies.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Revenues from parts sales are recognized at the time of shipment.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	Revenue from training and service contracts is recognized ratably over the training period and contract period.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	A provision for the estimated cost of fulfilling warranty obligations is recorded at the time the related revenue is recognized.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Revenue from software license fees is recognized upon shipment or customer acknowledgment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and VSOE exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	License support and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	Deferred revenue represents undelivered items, prepaid service contract revenue and prepaid license support and maintenance revenue.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P33_S3	Deferred revenue is recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policies described above.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	We specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if our assumptions are otherwise incorrect, additional allowances may be required.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P34_S3	We maintain reserves for our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product life-cycles, product demand and market conditions.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P34_S4	If actual product life-cycles, product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those originally projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	We account for acquired or merged businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition or merger at their respective fair values.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	Accordingly, for significant acquisitions, we typically obtain assistance from independent valuation specialists.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	There are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	For intangible assets, we typically utilize the income method.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the projected future cash flows (including timing) and the discount rate reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flows.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	For example, different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	All of these judgments and estimates can significantly impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P39_S3	Our formal annual impairment testing date for goodwill is October 31 st or prior to the next annual testing date if an event occurs or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	If, we elect this option and after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	We have not elected this option to date.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process which requires us to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	The first step consists of estimating the fair value of our aggregated reporting unit using the market value of our common stock at October 31 st , multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares (market capitalization) and an implied control premium as if it were to be acquired by a single stockholder.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	We obtain information on completed sales of similar companies in a comparable industry to estimate an implied control premium for us.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	We compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value which includes goodwill.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P42_S3	If the results of the initial market capitalization test produce results which are below the reporting unit carrying value, we will also consider if the market capitalization is temporarily low and, if so, we may also perform a discounted cash flow test.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the second step is completed to compute the impairment amount by determining the implied fair value of goodwill.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	This determination requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	which is compared to the corresponding carrying value to compute the goodwill impairment amount.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	We were not required to perform step two during our annual impairment test.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	Long-Lived Assets and Acquired Intangible Assets.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	We periodically review long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and the impairment of such long-lived assets, if any, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	No such indicators were noted in 2015 .
1094392_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	We are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our share grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	If the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	While we engage in product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P50_S3	Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	The need for a valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred taxes will be recoverable.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, we may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had valuation allowances of $2.2 million and $2.4 million on certain of our deferred tax assets to reflect, net of valuation allowance, the deferred tax assets at the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P51_S3	We evaluated the realizability of the deferred tax assets based on positive earnings from 2013 through 2015 as well as the projected earnings in future years and believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized in the future years.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P51_S4	We will continue to monitor the realizability of the deferred tax assets and evaluate the valuation allowance.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	The first step requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that the tax position has met the threshold for recognition; therefore, we must evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	The second step requires us to measure the tax benefit of the tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized when effectively settled.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P52_S3	This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P52_S4	We reevaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues, and new audit activity.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P52_S5	Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P52_S6	Although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P52_S7	If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, it could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2015, the Financial Account Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	This standard requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P53_S2	The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	adopted this ASU retrospectively in our year ended December 31, 2015 resulting in the reclassification of $9.0 million from net current deferred income tax assets to net long term deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2014.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P54_S2	This standard requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P54_S3	The ASU requires an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P54_S4	The standard is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	The adoption of ASU 2015-16 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330), Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	This ASU is intended to simplify subsequent measurement of inventory.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	An entity should measure inventory within a scope of this ASU at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P56_S3	Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal, and transportation.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P56_S4	The standard is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	In December 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-12, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	The guidance reflects the EITF consensus that an award with a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period (i.e., the employee would be eligible to vest in the award regardless of whether the employee is rendering service on the date the performance target could be achieved) should be treated as a performance condition.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P58_S2	That is, the performance target is not reflected in the determination of the grant date fair value of the award.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P58_S3	Compensation cost attributable to the period for which requisite service has been rendered would be recognized in the period it becomes probable that the performance condition will be achieved.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P58_S4	The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period would reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and would be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P58_S5	The standard is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P58_S6	The adoption of this new standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	ASU 2014-09 outlines a comprehensive revenue recognition model and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	In July 2015, the FASB deferred for one year the effective date of the new revenue standard, but early adoption will be permitted.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P59_S3	The new standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	ASU 2014-09 allows for two methods of adoption: (a) full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented, or (b) modified retrospective adoption, meaning the cumulative effect of applying ASU 2014-09 is recognized as an adjustment to the 2018 opening retained earnings balance.
1094392_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	We are in the process of determining the adoption method as well as the effects the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate and Credit Market Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates and market liquidity including our investments in certain available-for-sale securities and our convertible senior notes.
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our available-for-sale securities consist of fixed and variable rate debt investments (municipal notes and bonds).
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates, market liquidity and credit ratings of issuers from our available-for-sale securities.
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	It is possible that we are at risk if interest rates, market liquidity or credit ratings of issuers change in an unfavorable direction.
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	will be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our financial investments held as of December 31, 2015 , an immediate adverse change of 10% in interest rates (e.g. 3.00% to 3.30%) would result in an immaterial decrease in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities.
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The interest rate on our convertible senior notes is fixed.
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Therefore, any change in interest rates will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Foreign Currency Risk We have branch operations in Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea and wholly-owned subsidiaries in Europe, Japan and China.
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Our international subsidiaries and branches operate primarily using local functional currencies.
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P2_S2	These foreign branches and subsidiaries are limited in their operations and level of investment so that the risk of currency fluctuations is not material.
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P2_S3	A hypothetical 10% appreciation or depreciation in the U.S. dollar relative to the reporting currencies of our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 would have affected the foreign-currency-denominated non-operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries by approximately $2.0 million .
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	A substantial portion of our international systems sales are denominated in U.S. dollars with the exception of Japan and, as a result, we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these sales.
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Substantially all our sales in Japan are denominated in Japanese yen.
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	From time to time, we may enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within 12 months.
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The change in fair value of the forward contracts is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations each reporting period.
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P4_S2	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had thirteen and five forward contracts outstanding, respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P4_S3	The total notional contract value of these outstanding forward contracts at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $5.4 million and $1.6 million , respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1094392_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	The consolidated financial statements and related information required by this item are set forth on the pages indicated in Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1094392_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in SEC rules and forms.
1094392_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	These controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1094392_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, we have recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1094392_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management is required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures.
1094392_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	We performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, to assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2015 .
1094392_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2015 at the reasonable assurance level.
1094392_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
1094392_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1094392_16_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) ( COSO ).
1094392_16_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015 .
1094392_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1094392_16_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1094392_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 have been audited by Ernst Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1094392_16_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Ernst Young LLP has also audited our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , as stated in its attestation report included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company s quarter ended December 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

1094392_16_ITEM15_P17_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P17_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P18_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P18_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P19_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P19_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P20_S0	In our opinion, Rudolph Technologies, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P21_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Rudolph Technologies, Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 of Rudolph Technologies, Inc. and our report dated February 19, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1094392_16_ITEM15_P27_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P27_S2	Revenue is recognized provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P27_S3	Revenue recognition generally results at the following points: (1) for all transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment for all products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment; the portion of revenue associated with certain installation-related tasks is deferred, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation-related tasks; (2) for products that have not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized at customer technical acceptance; (3) for transactions with arrangements with multiple elements, such as sales of products that include software and services, the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred using the relative selling price method utilizing vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) or estimated sales prices ( ESP ) until delivery of the deferred elements.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P28_S0	Third-party evidence is not typically used to determine selling prices as to limited availability of reliable competitor products selling prices.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P29_S0	The ESP is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, gross margin objectives, internal costs and competitor pricing strategies.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P30_S0	Revenues from parts sales are recognized at the time of shipment.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P30_S1	Revenue from training and service contracts is recognized ratably over the training period and contract period.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P30_S2	A provision for the estimated cost of fulfilling warranty obligations is recorded at the time the related revenue is recognized.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P30_S3	Revenue from software license fees is recognized upon shipment or customer acknowledgment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and VSOE exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P30_S4	License support and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P30_S5	Deferred revenue represents undelivered items, prepaid service contract revenue and prepaid license support and maintenance revenue.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P30_S6	Deferred revenue is recognized in accordance with the Company s revenue recognition policies described above.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P31_S0	C. Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P32_S0	business combination (including contingent consideration), recoverability and useful lives of property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets, recoverability of goodwill, recoverability of deferred tax assets, liabilities for product warranty, contingencies, including litigation reserves and share-based payments, including forfeitures and liabilities for tax uncertainties.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P32_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P33_S0	D. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include cash and highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P33_S1	E. Marketable Securities: The Company determined that all of its investment securities are to be classified as available-for-sale.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P33_S2	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity under the caption Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P33_S3	Realized gains and losses, interest and dividends on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income and other, net.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P34_S0	Available-for-sale securities are classified as current assets regardless of their maturity date if they are available for use in current operations.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P35_S0	The Company reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P35_S1	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, credit quality and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P35_S2	When a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities are charged against earnings.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P36_S0	The specific identification method is used to determine the gains and losses on marketable securities.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P36_S1	For additional information on the Company s marketable securities, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P37_S0	F. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P37_S1	In the cases where the Company is aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligation, the Company records a specific allowance against amounts due, and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount management reasonably believes will be collected.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P37_S2	For all other customers, the Company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are outstanding, industry and geographic concentrations, the current business environment and historical experience.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P38_S0	G. Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis, and include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P38_S1	The Company reviews and sets standard costs as needed, but at a minimum on an annual basis, at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P38_S2	The Company evaluates inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P38_S3	The Company establishes inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon assumptions about historical and future demand for the Company s products and market conditions.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P38_S4	In addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering design changes.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P39_S0	Once a reserve has been established, it is maintained until the item to which it relates is scrapped or sold.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P40_S0	H. Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P41_S0	years for machinery and equipment, seven years for furniture and fixtures, and three years for computer equipment.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P42_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related asset.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P42_S1	Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and major renewals and betterments are capitalized.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	I. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and identifiable acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P44_S1	If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is generally based on discounted cash flows.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P45_S0	J. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P45_S1	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually and when there are indications of impairment.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P46_S0	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P46_S1	The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P46_S2	If, the Company elects this option and after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is not likely that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P46_S3	The Company has not elected this option to date.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P47_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting unit using the market value of its common stock at October 31 multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares (market capitalization) and an implied control premium as it were to be acquired by a single stockholder.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P47_S1	The Company also obtains information on completed sales of similar companies in the related industry to estimate the implied control premium for the Company.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	If the results of the initial market capitalization test produce results which are below the reporting unit carrying value, the Company may also perform a discounted cash flow test.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	The Company tested for goodwill impairment on October 31, 2015 .
1094392_16_ITEM15_P49_S1	For additional information on the Company s goodwill and purchased intangible assets, see Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	K. Concentration of Credit Risk: Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P50_S1	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral for sales on credit.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P50_S2	The Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P50_S3	The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities with higher credit quality issuers and monitors the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	L. Warranties: The Company generally provides a warranty on its products for a period of twelve to fifteen months against defects in material and workmanship.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P51_S1	The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	M. Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach for deferred taxes which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company s consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce a deferred tax asset to that portion which more likely than not will be realized.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	The Company does not provide for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign operations as it is the Company s intention to permanently re-invest undistributed earnings.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P54_S1	The impact of an uncertain income tax position is recognized as the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority and includes consideration of interest and penalties.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P54_S2	An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified as non-current as the Company has early adopted the new ASU No. 2015-17 Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P55_S1	For additional information on the Company s income taxes, see Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	N. Translation of Foreign Currencies: The Company has branch operations in Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea and wholly-owned subsidiaries in the United States, Europe, Japan and China.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P56_S1	Its international subsidiaries and branches operate primarily using local functional currencies.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P56_S2	These foreign branches and subsidiaries are limited in their operations and level of investment so that the risk of currency fluctuations is not material.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P56_S3	A substantial portion of the Company s international systems sales are denominated in U.S. dollars with the exception of Japan and, as a result, it has relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these sales.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P56_S4	Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and income and expense accounts and cash flow items are translated at average monthly exchange rates during the period.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P56_S5	Net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements and the effect of exchange rates on intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature are recorded directly as a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption, Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P56_S6	Any foreign currency gains or losses related to transactions are included in operating results.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P56_S7	The Company had accumulated exchange losses resulting from the translation of foreign operation financial statements of $2,623 and $2,685 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	O. Share-based Compensation: The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires significant judgment.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P58_S1	Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from the Company s current estimates.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	Compensation expense for all share-based payments includes an estimate for forfeitures and is recognized over the expected term of the share-based awards using the straight-line method.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P59_S1	For additional information on the Company s share-based compensation plans, see Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	P. Research and Development and Software Development Costs: Expenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	Certain software product development costs incurred after technological feasibility has been established are capitalized and amortized, commencing upon the general release of the software product to the Company s customers, over the economic life of the software product.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P61_S1	Annual amortization of capitalized costs is computed using the greater of: (i) the ratio of current gross revenues for the software product over the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for the software product or (ii) the straight-line basis, typically over seven years.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	technological feasibility are expensed as incurred and included in research and development costs.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P62_S1	At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company did not have any capitalized software development costs.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P62_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , software development cost amortization totaled $0 , $5 and $185 , respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	Q. Shipping and Handling Costs: Shipping and handling cost are included as a component of cost of revenues.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P63_S1	R. Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P63_S2	The carrying amount of our convertible senior notes was $58,107 and $54,773 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P63_S3	The fair value of our convertible senior notes was $60,630 and $59,916 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P63_S4	The Company s convertible senior notes are not publicly traded.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	The estimated fair value of these obligations is based, primarily, on a market approach, comparing the Company s interest rates to those rates the Company believes it would reasonably receive upon re-entry into the market.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P64_S1	Judgment is required to estimate the fair value, using available market information and appropriate valuation methods.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P64_S2	For additional information on the Company s fair value of financial instruments, see Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P65_S0	S. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities: The Company, when it considers it to be appropriate, enters into forward contracts to hedge the economic exposures arising from foreign currency denominated transactions.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P65_S1	At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , these contracts included the future sale of Japanese Yen to purchase U.S. dollars.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P65_S2	The foreign currency forward contracts were entered into by the Company s Japanese subsidiary to hedge a portion of certain intercompany obligations.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P65_S3	The forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and therefore, the change in fair value is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P65_S4	The Company records its forward contracts at fair value in either prepaid expenses and other current assets or other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P65_S5	The dollar equivalent of the U.S. dollar forward contracts and related fair values as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:
1094392_16_ITEM15_P66_S0	In 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the Company recognized gains of $221 , $150 and $374 with respect to forward contracts that matured, respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P66_S1	The aggregate notional amount of matured contracts was $2,484 , $1,456 and $2,922 , for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	T. Contingencies and Litigation The Company is subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies, including certain legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P67_S1	The Company accrues for a loss contingency when it concludes that the likelihood of a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P67_S2	If the Company concludes that loss contingencies that could be material to any one of its financial statements are not probable, but are reasonably possible, or are probable, but cannot be estimated, then the Company discloses the nature of the loss contingencies, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	Company expenses as incurred the costs of defending legal claims against the Company.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	The Company does not recognize gain contingencies until realized.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P68_S2	See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies for a detailed description.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2015 financial statement presentation.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P69_S1	These amounts include reclassification of a portion of deferred revenue to other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P69_S2	These reclassifications were not considered material to the prior year financial statements.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P70_S0	V. Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In November 2015, the Financial Account Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P70_S1	This standard requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P70_S2	The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P70_S3	Early adoption is permitted and the Company adopted this ASU retrospectively in its year ended December 31, 2015 consolidated statement of financial position resulting in the reclassification of $8,986 from net current deferred income tax assets to net long term deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2014.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P70_S4	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P70_S5	This standard requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P70_S6	The ASU requires an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P70_S7	The standard is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P71_S0	The adoption of ASU 2015-16 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P72_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330), Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P72_S1	This ASU is intended to simplify subsequent measurement of inventory.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P72_S2	An entity should measure inventory within a scope of this ASU at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P72_S3	Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal, and transportation.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P72_S4	The standard is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P73_S0	The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P74_S0	In December 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-12, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P74_S1	The guidance reflects the EITF consensus that an award with a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period (i.e., the employee would be eligible to vest in the award regardless of whether the employee is rendering service on the date the performance target could be achieved) should be treated as a performance condition.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P74_S2	That is, the performance target is not reflected in the determination of the grant date fair value of the award.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P74_S3	Compensation cost attributable to the period for which requisite service has been rendered would be recognized in the period it becomes probable that the performance condition will be achieved.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P74_S4	The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period would reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and would be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P74_S5	The standard is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P74_S6	The adoption of this new standard will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P75_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P75_S1	ASU 2014-09 outlines a comprehensive revenue recognition model and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P75_S2	In July 2015, the FASB deferred for one year the effective date of the new revenue standard, but early adoption will be permitted.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P75_S3	The new standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P76_S0	ASU 2014-09 allows for two methods of adoption: (a) full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented, or (b) modified retrospective adoption, meaning the cumulative effect of applying ASU 2014-09 is recognized as an adjustment to the 2018 opening retained earnings balance.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P76_S1	The Company is in the process of determining the adoption method as well as the effects the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P77_S0	Fair Value Measurements: The Company applies a three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurements.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P77_S1	This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P78_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P78_S1	Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P78_S2	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management s assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P79_S0	A financial asset s or liability s fair value measurement classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P79_S1	The following tables provide the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 :
1094392_16_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company s investments classified as Level 1 are based on quoted prices that are available in active markets.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P81_S0	The foreign currency forward contracts are primarily measured based on the foreign currency spot and forward rates quoted by the banks or foreign currency dealers.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P82_S0	Investment prices are obtained from third party pricing providers, which models prices utilizing the above observable inputs, for each asset class.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P83_S0	Level 3 investments consisted of contingent consideration related to an acquisition for which the Company uses a discounted cash flow model to value these investments.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P83_S1	The Level 3 assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for the contingent consideration included projected revenues, estimates of discount rates of 18.0% and timing of cash flows.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P83_S2	A significant decrease in the projected revenues or increase in discount rates could result in a significantly lower fair value measurement for the contingent consideration.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P84_S0	This table presents a reconciliation for all liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the year ended December 31, 2015 :
1094392_16_ITEM15_P85_S0	See Note 4 for additional discussion regarding the fair value of the Company s marketable securities.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P86_S0	The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P86_S1	The estimated fair value of these obligations is based, primarily, on a market approach, comparing the Company s interest rates to those rates the Company believes it would reasonably receive upon re-entry into the market.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P86_S2	Judgment is required to estimate the fair value, using available market information and appropriate valuation methods.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Company s convertible senior notes are not publicly traded.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P87_S1	The estimated fair value of the Company s convertible senior notes was valued using a discounted cash flow model.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P87_S2	The Level 3 assumptions, based on data available at the valuation date used in preparing the discounted cash flow model included estimates of interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the convertible senior notes.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P87_S3	The fair value of the contingent interest associated with the convertible senior notes is valued quarterly using the present value of expected cash flow model incorporating the probabilities of the contingent events occurring.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P88_S0	The following table reflects information pertaining to the Company s convertible senior notes:
1094392_16_ITEM15_P89_S0	Marketable Securities: The Company has evaluated its investment policies and determined that all of its investment securities are to be classified as available-for-sale.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P89_S1	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported in Stockholders Equity under the caption Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P89_S2	Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in Other expense (income).
1094392_16_ITEM15_P89_S3	The Company records other-than-temporary impairment charges for its available-for-sale investments when it intends to sell the securities, it is more-likely-than not that it will be required to sell the securities before a recovery, or when it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the securities.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P90_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P91_S0	The Company has determined that the gross unrealized losses on its marketable securities at December 31, 2015 and 2014 are temporary in nature.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P91_S1	The Company reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P91_S2	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, credit quality and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P92_S0	At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , marketable securities are categorized as follows:
1094392_16_ITEM15_P93_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable securities classified by the maturity date listed on the security, regardless of the Consolidated Balance Sheet classification, is as follows at December 31, 2015 and 2014 :
1094392_16_ITEM15_P94_S0	The following table summarizes the estimated fair value and gross unrealized holding losses of marketable securities, aggregated by investment instrument and period of time in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2015 and 2014 .

1094392_16_ITEM15_P106_S1	The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of July 25, 2011 (the Indenture ), between the Company and Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee, which includes a form of Note.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P106_S2	The Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning January 15, 2012 , at an annual rate of 3.75% and will mature on July 15, 2016 , unless earlier converted or repurchased.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P106_S3	The Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, based on an initial conversion rate of 77.241 shares of Company common stock per $1 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $12.95 per share.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P106_S4	The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the Notes, including the convertible note hedge and warrant discussed below, were $50,249 .
1094392_16_ITEM15_P106_S5	The following table reflects the net carrying value of the Notes as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 :
1094392_16_ITEM15_P107_S0	calendar quarter commencing after September 30, 2011, if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day; 2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading-day period (the measurement period ) in which the trading price (as defined in the Indenture) per $1 principal amount of the Notes for each trading day of such measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock and the applicable conversion rate on such trading day; or 3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P107_S1	On and after April 15, 2016 , until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of July 15, 2016 , holders may convert their notes, in multiples of $1 principal amount, regardless of whether any of the foregoing conditions have been met.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P107_S2	Upon conversion, the Company will deliver to holders in respect of each $1 principal amount of Notes being converted a settlement amount equal to the sum of the daily settlement amounts for each of the 40 consecutive trading days during the applicable cash settlement averaging period.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P107_S3	The conversion value of each Note will be paid in: 1) cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be converted, and 2) to the extent the conversion value exceeds the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted, the Company s common stock in respect of the remainder (plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of common stock).
1094392_16_ITEM15_P107_S4	The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain circumstances but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P108_S0	Upon a fundamental change at any time, as defined in the Indenture, the Company will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with a make whole fundamental change, as defined in the Indenture.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P108_S1	In addition, the holders may, subject to certain conditions, require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes upon a fundamental change at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P108_S2	The Company separately accounts for the liability and equity components of the Notes.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P108_S3	The initial debt component of the Notes were valued at $45,493 based on the present value of the future cash flows using a discount rate of 10% , the Company s assumed borrowing rate at the date of issuance for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P108_S4	The equity component was valued at $14,507 .
1094392_16_ITEM15_P108_S5	Total issuance costs were $2,251 , of which $544 was allocated to the equity component and $1,707 was allocated to debt issuance costs and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P108_S6	The following table presents the amount of interest cost recognized relating to the Notes during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
1094392_16_ITEM15_P109_S0	The remaining bond discount of the Notes of $1,893 , as of December 31, 2015 will be amortized over the remaining life of the Notes.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P110_S0	Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, the Company purchased a convertible note hedge and sold a warrant.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P110_S1	Each of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions were entered into with an affiliate of the initial purchaser of the Notes (the Option Counterparty ).
1094392_16_ITEM15_P110_S2	The convertible note hedge is intended to reduce the potential future dilution to the Company s common stock associated with the conversion of the Notes.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P110_S3	However, the warrant transaction will have a dilutive effect on the Company s earnings per share to the extent that the price of the Company s common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrant.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P111_S0	The strike price of the warrant is initially $17.00 per share.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P111_S1	Each of these components is discussed separately below:
1094392_16_ITEM15_P112_S0	The Option Counterparty agreed to sell to the Company up to approximately 4,634 shares of the Company s common stock, which is the maximum number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, at a price of $12.95 per share.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P112_S1	The convertible note hedge transaction will be settled in shares of the Company s common stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) and will expire on the earlier of the second scheduled trading day (as defined in the Indenture) prior to the maturity date of the Notes or the last day any of the Notes remain outstanding.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P112_S2	Subject to certain terms and conditions, settlement of the convertible note hedge would result in the Company receiving shares of the Company s common stock equivalent to the number of shares that the Company is obligated to deliver to holders of the Notes upon conversion of the Notes.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P112_S3	The Company will not be required to make any cash payments to the Option Counterparty or its affiliates upon the exercise of the options that are a part of the convertible note hedge transaction, but will be entitled to receive from the Option Counterparty a number of shares of Company common stock generally based on the amount by which the market price per share of Company common stock, as measured under the terms of the convertible note hedge transaction, is greater than the strike price of the convertible note hedge transaction during the relevant valuation period under the convertible note hedge transaction.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P112_S4	The convertible note hedge transaction cost of $14,507 has been accounted for as an equity transaction.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P112_S5	The Company received $7,007 from the Option Counterparty from the sale of the warrant to purchase up to approximately 4,634 shares of the Company s common stock at a strike price of $17.00 per share.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P112_S6	As of December 31, 2015 , the warrant expires between October 13, 2016 and January 9, 2017 .
1094392_16_ITEM15_P112_S7	As of December 31, 2015 , the warrant had not been exercised and remained outstanding.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P112_S8	Additionally, if the market price per share of Company common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant transaction, exceeds the strike price of the warrant during the valuation period at the maturity of the warrant, the Company will owe the Option Counterparty a number of shares of Company common stock in an amount based on the excess of such market price per share of Company common stock over the strike price of the warrant.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P113_S0	The fair value of the warrant was initially recorded in equity and continues to be classified as equity.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P114_S0	The convertible note hedge transaction and the warrant transaction are separate transactions entered into by the Company.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P114_S1	Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the convertible note hedge transaction and the warrant transaction.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P115_S0	The Company has entered into agreements with customers that include limited intellectual property indemnification obligations that are customary in the industry.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P115_S1	These guarantees generally require the Company to compensate the other party for certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising from these transactions.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P116_S0	The nature of the intellectual property indemnification obligations prevents the Company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay to its customers.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P116_S1	Historically, the Company has not made any indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P117_S0	The Company generally provides a warranty on its products for a period of twelve to fifteen months against defects in material and workmanship.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P117_S1	The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred during the warranty period and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P117_S2	The Company s estimate is based primarily on historical experience.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P117_S3	The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P117_S4	Settlements of warranty reserves are generally associated with sales that occurred during the 12 to 15 months prior to the year-end and warranty accruals are related to sales during the year.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P117_S5	Changes in the Company s warranty reserves are as follows:
1094392_16_ITEM15_P118_S0	Legal Matters From time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P118_S1	The following reflects an overview of the material activities with regard to these matters through December 31, 2015.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P119_S0	Integrated Technology Corporation v. Rudolph Technologies, Inc., No. CV-06-2182 (PHX-ROS) : As previously disclosed, in December 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of specific assets and liabilities of the semiconductor division of Applied Precision LLC ( Applied ).
1094392_16_ITEM15_P119_S1	As a result of the acquisition, the Company assumed certain liabilities of Applied including a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court, District of Arizona, by Integrated Technology Corporation ( ITC ) which alleged Applied s PrecisionPoint , PrecisionWoRx and ProbeWoRx products infringed an ITC patent.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P119_S2	Prior to trial, the District Court ruled that such products sold prior to August of 2007 (the pre-August 2007 tools ) infringed the ITC patent.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P119_S3	At trial in December of 2011, a trial verdict was rendered in which the jury found that while the Company s products manufactured after August of 2007 (the post-August 2007 tools ) did not literally infringe ITC s patent, the products were found to infringe under a rule known as the doctrine of equivalents, a legal principle which expands the language of patent claims to encompass products or processes which may otherwise be found not to literally infringe the patent.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P119_S4	The jury awarded $15,475 to ITC in damages for sales made during the years 2000-2011, of which approximately one-half related to sales for pre-August 2007 tools.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P119_S5	The jury found that for the sales of the post-August 2007 tools, the infringement was willful.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P119_S6	On July 23, 2012, the District Court issued an Order which affirmed the jury s award, applied treble damages to the portion of the jury award related to post-August 2007 tool sales and granted ITC s motion for attorney s fees and prejudgment interest on the verdict and attorney s fees.
1094392_16_ITEM15_P119_S7	At that time, the District Court also enjoined the Company from future infringement of the ITC patent and from selling or supplying the applicable products with the applicable features from or into the United States.

1094392_17_ITEM1_P0_S3	In addition, our advanced process control software portfolio includes powerful solutions to enhance productivity and achieve significant cost savings.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	Rudolph systems are backed by worldwide customer service and applications support.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	Rudolph continues to drive the technological innovation of its inspection and metrology products to deliver solutions that address the demanding needs across the front-end and back-end processes of semiconductor manufacturing.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	In 2016, Rudolph unveiled a new inspection suite that includes high-resolution inspection for front- and back-end applications (Firefly series) and high-speed two-dimensional (2D) inspection (Dragonfly system).
1094392_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	often escape conventional illumination techniques by fluorescing organic materials, thereby reducing a source of yield-robbing interconnect failures.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	As advanced packaging continues to drive process development in the semiconductor industry, the demand for lower cost with higher performance has driven manufacturers to develop innovative solutions.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	One new approach to reducing overall cost is to switch from (round) wafers to a larger-size rectangular panel format.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P4_S2	Research group Yole Developpement describes the cost advantages and economy of scale benefits as key enablers propelling the growth of advanced packaging processes such as fan-out, interposers and embedded die panel packages.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P4_S3	Rudolph is poised to play an integral role in this transition with its panel lithography and inspection solutions.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	The need for more process monitoring and control continues to increase for semiconductor and related industries.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	Predictive analytics can lower maintenance costs, rate of scrap wafers, unscheduled tool downtime and material costs.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	Rudolph s established fault detection and classification software, which is incorporated into tools manufactured Veeco Instruments, allows customers to seamlessly turn equipment data into actionable operational information.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	This collaboration is designed to enhance etch and deposition tool performance.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	Industry Trends Advanced Packaging refers to a series of technology that enables the miniaturization of electronic products, such as portable consumer devices, including smartphones and laptops.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	In electronics manufacturing, integrated circuit packaging is the final stage of semiconductor device fabrication, in which the tiny block of semiconducting material (die) is encased in a supporting package that provides an external electrical connection and prevents physical damage and corrosion.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	Packaging refers loosely to the conductors and other structures that interconnect the semiconductor circuits, feed them with electric power, discharge their heat and protect them from damage.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P8_S2	Today, the drive to pack more functions into a small space and reduce their power requirements demands that chip packages do much more than ever before.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P8_S3	Examples of advanced packaging are varied and include flip-chip bumping, pillar bumping, wafer-level chip scale packaging and 3D packaging.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	One technology used in advanced packaging is the 3D integration of semiconductors and other devices.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	The technology involves stacking individual die or wafers in one integrated housing.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	Through-silicon vias (TSV, 3D stacking) are the interconnects that allow communication among the individually stacked components.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	This offers the advantages of shorter signal paths and in turn reduced power consumption, enhanced bandwidths, integration of heterogeneous components such as sub-chips, smaller surface area and reduced expense.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	The processes required for 3D integration are still being optimized for yield, and to ensure the functioning of individual microchips.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	Fan-out on wafer/panel level is another advanced packaging technology that is being used within the industry as the next disruptive technology for several reasons.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	First, it simplifies the manufacturing process by eliminating the need for micro bumps, C4 bumps, through-silicon via (TSV) and interposers.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P11_S2	Next, it improves cost by eliminating the need for a substrate, which accounts for 35 percent of the packaging cost.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P11_S3	Lastly, the technology is being considered as the vehicle for next generation uses such as multiple die packages and may even extend into package on package formats.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P11_S4	Because of its low form factor, it is seen within the industry as essential for mobile and wearable products.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	The current and projected adoption of smart mobile devices with designed-in capability to enable multiple functions in a single device continues to grow.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	In reality, there are no longer single function devices, but instead, a combined single device provides multiple functions.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	For example, smartphone users no longer need a separate GPS, digital camera and PDA.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P12_S3	Aided by a myriad of available apps, the potential uses seem endless.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P12_S4	As a result, these added functions in mobile products are driving semiconductor advanced packaging and display manufacturers to implement next-generation technologies to meet these requirements.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P12_S5	These technology shifts are creating multiple opportunities for Rudolph solutions.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P12_S6	In order to meet the growing demand at reduced average selling price, manufacturers are looking to scalable technology.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P12_S7	Advanced packaging facilities looking to improve Cost of Ownership ( COO ) and increase productivity are transitioning to large rectangular panels ranging up to Gen 3.5 (approximately 650mm x 720mm).
1094392_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	Traditional technology has been limited to standard wafer sizes (200mm, 300mm).
1094392_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	However, with companies progressively moving to larger area packages, they are no longer limited to operating within the constraints of a round wafer.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P13_S2	By responding to market opportunities and addressing the stringent demands of customers technical roadmaps, Rudolph is optimally positioned to capitalize on the emerging market of high volume panel manufacturing.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	S Series, having emerged from the flat panel display market, is readily capable of processing both glass and organic laminate panels in the semiconductor advanced packaging market.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	The Firefly S Series, designed for high resolution inspection, provides a combination of defect sensitivity and substrate flexibility in a single platform.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P14_S2	It reduces capital investment requirements and provides a reliable pathway to transition from wafer to panel-based processes.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	Technology We believe that our expertise in engineering and our continued investment in research and development enable us to rapidly develop new technologies and products in order to quickly respond to emerging industry trends.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	The breadth of our technology enables us to offer a diverse combination of process and process control solutions.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P15_S2	Unique features have been designed into our lithography systems to meet our customers changing process requirements.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P15_S3	Our metrology and inspection technologies provide process control for the majority of wafers processed today in semiconductor manufacturing.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P15_S4	In front-end processes, thin film metrology and defect detection and classification technologies allow yield enhancement for critical processes such as photolithography, diffusion, etch, CMP and outgoing quality control.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P15_S5	Within the final manufacturing (back-end) processes, advanced macro defect inspection provides our customers with critical quality assurance and process information.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing or general handling, and can have a major impact on device and process quality.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	Lastly, we turn all of the data gathered into useful knowledge for our customers to make yield-enhancing decisions.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	Process Control Business Macro Defect Inspection.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	Chip manufacturers deploy advanced macro defect inspection throughout the fab to monitor key process steps, gather process-enhancing information and ultimately, lower manufacturing costs.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	Field-established tools such as the F30 and NSX inspection systems are found in wafer processing (front-end) and final manufacturing (back-end) facilities around the world.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P17_S3	These high-speed tools incorporate features such as waferless recipe creation, tool-to-tool correlation and multiple inspection resolutions.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P17_S4	In addition, to wafer frontside inspection, Rudolph s innovative Explorer Platform allows wafer edge and backside inspection in one integrated platform to enhance productivity and continuously improve fab yield.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	Using Discover yield management software, the vast amounts of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed and classified to determine trends that ultimately affect yield.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	All-surface refers to inspection of the wafer frontside, edge, and backside as well as post-fab die.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	The edge inspection process focuses on the area near the wafer edge, an area that poses difficulty for traditional wafer frontside inspection technology due to its varied topography and process variation.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	Edge bevel inspection looks for defects on the side edge of a wafer.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Edge bead removal and edge exclusion metrology involve a topside surface measurement required exclusively in the photolithography process, primarily to determine if wafers have been properly aligned for the edge exclusion region.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	The primary reason for wafer backside inspection is to determine if contamination has been created that may spread throughout the fab.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	For instance, it is critical that the wafer backside be free of defects prior to the photolithography process to prevent focus and exposure problems on the wafer frontside.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	Residue is difficult or impossible to see with conventional white light imaging techniques.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	Residue contaminants are often the root cause of field failures, which occur after the material has been exposed to normal operating conditions for extended periods.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	Rudolph s new Clearfind technology highlights residue on bumps and bond pads or at the bottoms of vias so that they are easy to detect.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P24_S2	On metals, it eliminates the high-contrast graininess seen under conventional illumination, resulting in an obvious defect signal against a featureless background.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P24_S3	This same graininess in conventional imaging can also cause false positives, which are especially costly at this stage of the process where the sunk cost of unnecessarily rejected good product is high.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P24_S4	Finally, Clearfind technology readily detects shorts and opens in metal lines when inspected with an underlying organic layer.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	Automated Defect Classification and Pattern Analysis.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	Automating the defect detection and classification process is best done by a system that can mimic, or even extend, the response of the human eye, but at a much higher speed, with higher resolution and more consistency.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P25_S2	To do this, our systems capture full-color whole wafer images using simultaneous dark and bright field illumination.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P25_S3	The resulting bright and dark field images are compared to those from an ideal wafer having no defects.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P25_S4	When a difference is detected, its image is broken down into mathematical vectors that allow rapid and accurate comparison with a library of known classified defects stored in the tool s database.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P25_S5	Patented and proprietary enhancements of this approach enable very fast and highly repeatable image classification.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P25_S6	The system is pre-programmed with an extensive library of default local, global and color defects and can also absorb a virtually unlimited amount of new defect classes.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	classification system, provides more reliable automated rework decisions and enables more accurate statistical process control data.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	Reviewing defects off-line enables automated inspection systems to maintain their utilization for high throughput inspection.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	Using defect image files captured by automated inspection systems, operators are able to view high-resolution defect images to determine defects that cause catastrophic failure of a device, or killer defects.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	Combining the review process with classifying defects enables faster analysis by grouping defects found together as one larger defect, a scratch for example, and defects of similar types across a wafer lot to be grouped based on size, repeating defects and other user-defined specifications.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P27_S2	Using wafer maps, charts and graphs, the vast amounts of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed to determine trends across bumps, die, wafers and lots.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P27_S3	This analysis may determine where in the process a variation is being introduced, allowing for enhancements to be made, thus yields improved.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	Defect data analysis is performed to identify, analyze and locate the source of defects and other manufacturing process excursions.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	Using either a single wafer map or a composite map created from multiple wafer maps, this analysis enables identification of defect patterns and distribution.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P28_S2	When combined with inspection data from strategically-placed inspection points, this analysis may pinpoint the source of the defects so corrective action can be taken.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P28_S3	The combination of Fast 3D-OCM (optical comparative metrology) Technology with improved testing accuracy and repeatability is designed to reduce total test time for even the most advanced large area probe cards.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P28_S4	The 3D capabilities enable users to analyze probe marks and probe tips in a rapid and information-rich format.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	Optical acoustic metrology involves the use of ultra-fast laser induced sonar for metal and opaque thin film measurement.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	This technology sends ultrasonic waves into multi-layer opaque films and then analyzes the resulting echoes to simultaneously determine the thickness of each individual layer in complex multi-layer metal film stacks.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P29_S2	The echo s amplitude and phase can be used to detect film properties, missing layers and interlayer problems.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P29_S3	Since different phenomena affect amplitude and phase uniquely, a variety of process critical interlayer problems can be detected in a single measurement.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	The use of optical acoustics to measure multi-layer metal and opaque films was pioneered by scientists at Brown University ( Brown ) in collaboration with engineers at Rudolph.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	The proprietary optical acoustic technology in our PULSE Technology systems measures the thickness of single or multi-layer opaque films ranging from less than 40 Angstroms to greater than five microns.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P30_S2	It provides these measurements at a rate of up to 70 wafers per hour within one to two percent accuracy and typically less than one percent repeatability.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P30_S3	This range of thicknesses covers the majority of thick and thin metal films projected by the International Roadmap for Semiconductors to be used through the end of this decade.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our non-contact, non-destructive optical acoustic technology and small spot size enable our PULSE Technology systems to measure film properties directly on product wafers.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	The Meta PULSE System gives customers the ability to simultaneously measure the thickness and other properties of up to six metal or other opaque film layers without contacting in a non-destructive manner on product wafers.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	PULSE Technology uses an ultra-fast laser to generate sound waves that pass down through a stack of opaque films such as those used in copper or aluminum interconnect processes, sending back to the surface an echo that indicates film thickness, density, and other process critical parameters.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	We believe we are a leader in providing systems that can measure opaque thin-film stacks non-destructively with the speed and accuracy semiconductor device manufacturers demand in order to achieve high yields with the latest fabrication processes.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P32_S2	The technology is ideal for characterizing copper interconnect structures.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P32_S3	The Meta PULSE System, used mainly for fast and accurate measurements of metal interconnect in front-end wafer processing applications, has now been chosen by back-end manufacturers to perform system measurements in new process applications, driven by the need for on-product metrology as feature sizes decrease and pattern densities increase.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	Ellipsometry is a non-contact, non-destructive optical technique for transparent thin film measurement.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P33_S1	We have been an industry leader in ellipsometry technology for the last three decades.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P33_S2	We hold patents on several ellipsometry technologies, including our proprietary technique that uses four lasers for multiple-angle of incidence, multiple wavelength ellipsometry.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P33_S3	Laser ellipsometry technology enables our transparent film systems to provide the increasingly higher level of accuracy needed as thinner films and newer materials are introduced for future generations of semiconductor devices.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P33_S4	We extended this same optical technology to characterize the scatterometry signal from patterned surfaces, allowing measurement of critical dimensions.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P33_S5	For applications requiring broader spectral coverage, some of our ellipsometry tools are also equipped with a reflectometer.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	transparent thin films by analyzing the wavelength and intensity of light reflected from the surface of a wafer.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	This optical information is processed with software algorithms to determine film thickness and other material properties.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P34_S2	By combining data from both the laser ellipsometer and broad spectrum reflectometer, it is possible to characterize films and film stacks that cannot be adequately analyzed by either method individually.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	Rudolph s patented transparent film technology uses up to four lasers operating simultaneously at multiple angles and multiple wavelengths, providing powerful analysis and measurement capabilities.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	Unlike the white-light sources used in spectroscopic ellipsometers, laser light sources make our metrology tools inherently stable, increase measurement speed and accuracy, and reduce maintenance costs by minimizing the time required to re-qualify a light source when it is replaced.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	Rudolph s S3000SX System is targeted for transparent films in advanced semiconductor fabrication applications at the 28nm node and below.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	The S3000 product family uses Rudolph s proprietary Focused Beam Ellipsometry ( FBE ) and newly-designed Small Site Measurement Optics ( SSMO ) to measure the thickness of single layer and multi-layer films on product wafers including device area at site sizes as small as 30x30 nanometers.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	Lithography Business Step and Repeat Technology.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	Rudolph steppers use projection optics to expose circuit patterns from a mask or reticle onto a substrate to achieve images with optimal fidelity.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	These systems employ light from a mercury arc lamp that is transmitted through a mask or reticle containing display circuit patterns.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	Substrates are aligned on the system and the mask is imaged through a projection lens in photoresist material coated on the substrate.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P40_S2	The substrate is then moved, or stepped, to a second position to expose an adjacent area.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P40_S3	Images can be stitched together precisely to form larger circuit patterns without any noticeable change in circuit performance.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P40_S4	The system repeats the step and exposure process until the entire substrate is patterned.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P40_S5	Once the exposure process has been completed, the substrate is developed with an alkali solution to reveal the underlying material.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P40_S6	The imaged photoresist serves as a stencil barrier that allows for the processing of the underlying metal or insulating layers.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P40_S7	The substrates then continue through the etching, stripping and deposition processes until multi-layer circuits are completed.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	In order to deal with increased input/output ( I/O ) resulting from devices with enhanced functionality, power efficiency and higher frequency, integrated device manufacturers ( IDMs ) and outsourced semiconductor assembly and test facilities ( OSATs ) must improve the lithography capabilities for their advanced packaging technologies.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	However, the associated substrates and processes are significantly different than those used in front-end wafer processing.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	For advanced packaging, the lithography system must meet the performance required for finer features.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	Additionally, since most packaging is an additive process, thick films are used to enable the creation of features.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P42_S2	In order for equipment to effectively function in this environment, it must overcome these challenges.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P42_S3	Rudolph s JetStep Systems have been specifically designed to meet these challenges head on.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P42_S4	The JetStep W Series is designed for wafers and other round substrates while the JetStep S Series is designed for rectangular substrates (panels).
1094392_17_ITEM1_P42_S5	Both systems boast a large printable field, which when combined with user-selectable wavelength options, maximizes throughput while not limiting resolution when needed.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P42_S6	High fidelity optics are able to image the fine features required while at the same time achieving superior depth of field to minimize non-flatness effects.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P42_S7	On-the-fly auto focus and an innovative reticle management system improve yield and utilization.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P42_S8	These features result in a revolutionary lithography system specifically designed to meet advanced packaging challenges.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	Flat Panel Display ( FPD ) Lithography .
1094392_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	A critical aspect of any leading mobile device is the display.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P44_S1	The display serves as the window to the user.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P44_S2	Therefore, it must effectively present graphics such as detailed maps, high resolution photos and streaming video in order to provide an enhanced user experience.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P44_S3	To accomplish this, the display transistor backplane, which is what controls the individual pixels, must operate at a high frequency and not limit the pixel resolution.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P44_S4	As a result, the transistors must have high mobility and only use a small portion of the pixel aperture.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	The backplane is manufactured on a sheet of glass; like the packaging substrate, it is non-flat and tends to distort further during processing.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P45_S1	Additionally, the displays are getting larger.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P45_S2	Manufacturers are looking to utilize larger glass substrates, making throughput a challenge for the lithography equipment.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P45_S3	To overcome this, Rudolph s JetStep G Series uses high-fidelity optics and the largest printable stepper field available enabling more displays per shot.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P45_S4	This feature, combined with on-the-fly auto-focus and magnification compensation, maximizes throughput and yield.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P45_S5	Finally, our patented grid stage allows the system to be easily configurable to meet the customer desired substrate size.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	Integrated Software Solutions Process Control Software .
1094392_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	We provide a wide range of advanced process control solutions, all designed to improve factory profitability, including run-to-run control, fault detection, classification and tool automation.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	Rudolph is a leading provider of Process Control Software in the semiconductor industry.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	Advanced process control (APC) employs software to automatically detect or predict tool failure (fault detection) as well as calculate recipe settings for a process that will drive the process output to target despite variations in the incoming material and disturbances within the process equipment.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	Process control software enables the factory to increase capacity and yield while decreasing rework and scrap.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	It enables reduced production costs by lowering consumables, process engineering time and manufacturing cycle time.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P48_S3	Semiconductor manufacturers use YMS to obtain valuable process yield and equipment productivity information.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P48_S4	The data necessary to generate productivity information comes from many different sources throughout the fab: inspection and metrology systems, tool sensors, tool recipes, electrical tests and the fab environment.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	As the complexity and cost of manufacturing processes increase, the value of faster, better analysis to support critical manufacturing decisions grows.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	As a result, customers are demanding robust yield management systems that can analyze large, complex data sets quickly and effectively.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	Rudolph s fully-integrated YMS are designed to analyze data from disparate sources and multiple sites to maximize productivity across the entire value chain.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	Products Rudolph markets and sells products to major logic, memory, data storage, flat panel, application-specific integrated circuit ( ASIC ) device and packaging manufacturers.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	Our customers rely on us for versatile inspection, lithography and metrology systems as well as process control software solutions.

1094392_17_ITEM1_P51_S3	Our systems operate at high throughput in ultra-clean operation with high reliability.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	Customers Over 100 microelectronic device manufacturers have purchased Rudolph tools and software for installation at multiple sites.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P52_S1	We support a diverse customer base in terms of both geographic location and type of device manufactured.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P52_S2	Our customers are located in 20 countries.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P52_S3	See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information concerning our geographic information.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	We depend on a relatively small number of customers and end users for a large percentage of our revenues.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	In the years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , sales to end user customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for 34.5% , 23.3% and 23.9% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P53_S2	No individual end user customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
1094392_17_ITEM1_P53_S3	We do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	Research and Development The markets for equipment and systems for manufacturing semiconductor devices and for performing macro-defect inspection, advanced packaging lithography and thin film transparent and opaque process control metrology are characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	We believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products is critical to our success.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P54_S2	Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our technical, management and financial resources to research and development programs.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P54_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , we employed 184 research and development personnel.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	Our research and development expenditures in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were $45.0 million , $41.2 million and $40.6 million , respectively.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	We expect to continue our strong commitment to new product development and continue to allocate significant resources to these efforts in the future.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	We maintain an extensive network of direct sales, customer service and application support offices in the United States, Europe and Asia.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	We provide our customers with comprehensive support before, during and after the delivery of our products.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P56_S2	For example, in order to facilitate the smooth integration of our tools into our customers operations, we often assign dedicated, site-specific field service and applications engineers to provide long-term support at selected customer sites.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P56_S3	We also provide comprehensive service and applications training for customers at our training facilities in Bloomington, Minnesota and Budd Lake, New Jersey and at customer locations.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P56_S4	In addition, we maintain a group of highly skilled applications scientists at strategically located facilities throughout the world and at selected customer locations.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P56_S5	As of December 31, 2016 , we employed 251 sales and marketing, service and applications support personnel.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	Manufacturing Our principal manufacturing activities include assembly, final test and calibration.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	These activities are conducted in our manufacturing facilities in Bloomington, Minnesota and Wilmington, Massachusetts.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P57_S2	Our core manufacturing competencies include electrical, optical and mechanical assembly and testing, as well as the management of new product transitions.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P57_S3	While we use standard components and subassemblies wherever possible, most mechanical parts, metal fabrications and critical components used in our products are engineered and manufactured to our specifications.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P57_S4	We continue to rely on subcontractors and turnkey suppliers to fabricate components, build assemblies and perform other non-core activities in a cost-effective manner.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P57_S5	As of December 31, 2016 , we employed 79 manufacturing personnel.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P57_S6	We rely on a number of limited source suppliers for certain parts and subassemblies.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P57_S7	This reliance creates a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components, and reduced control over pricing and time of delivery of components.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P57_S8	An inability to obtain adequate supplies would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or might require us to redesign our systems to accommodate different components or subassemblies.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P57_S9	To date, we have not experienced any significant delivery delays.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P57_S10	However, if we were forced to seek alternative sources of supply, manufacture such components or subassemblies internally, or redesign our products, this could prevent us from shipping our products to our customers on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	We have a policy of seeking patents on inventions governing new products or technologies as part of our ongoing research, development, and manufacturing activities.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P58_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we have been granted, or hold exclusive licenses to, 268 U.S. and foreign patents.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P58_S2	The patents we own, jointly own or exclusively license have expiration dates ranging from 2017 to 2035 .
1094392_17_ITEM1_P58_S3	We also have 87 pending regular and provisional applications in the U.S. and other countries.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P58_S4	Our patents and applications principally cover various aspects of macro-defect detection and classification, transparent thin film measurement, altered material characterization, lithography techniques and automation.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P58_S5	We have been granted exclusive licenses from Brown University Research Foundation, subject to rights retained by Brown and the United States government for their own non-commercial uses, for several patents relating to the optical acoustic technology underlying our MetaPULSE product family.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P58_S6	The terms of these exclusive licenses are equal to the lives of the patents.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P58_S7	We pay royalties to Brown based upon a percentage of our revenues from the sale of systems that incorporate technology covered by the Brown patents.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P58_S8	We also have the right to support patent activity with respect to new ultra-fast acoustic technology developed by Brown scientists, and to acquire exclusive licenses to this technology.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P58_S9	Brown may terminate the licenses if we fail to pay royalties to Brown or if we materially breach our license agreement with Brown.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P58_S10	Our pending patents may never be issued, and even if they are, these patents, our existing patents and the patents we license may not provide sufficiently broad protection to protect our proprietary rights, or they may prove to be unenforceable.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P58_S11	To protect our proprietary rights, we also rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions and licenses.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P59_S1	The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same degree as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial infringement problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in such countries, some of which are countries in which we have sold and continue to sell products.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P59_S2	There is a risk that our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P59_S3	For example, our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P59_S4	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	Competition The market for semiconductor capital equipment is highly competitive.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	We face substantial competition from established companies in each of the markets that we serve.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P60_S2	We principally compete with KLA-Tencor, Camtek and Ultratech.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P60_S3	We compete to a lesser extent with companies such as Nanometrics, Nova Measuring Instruments and Nikon.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P60_S4	Each of our products also competes with products that use different metrology and inspection techniques.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P60_S5	Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, broader product offerings and service capabilities and larger installed customer bases than we do.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P60_S6	Significant competitive factors in the market for inspection and metrology systems include system performance, ease of use, reliability, cost of ownership, technical support and customer relationships.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P60_S7	We believe that, while price and delivery are important competitive factors, the customers overriding requirement is for a product that meets their technical capabilities.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P60_S8	To remain competitive, we believe we will need to maintain a high level of investment in research and development and process applications.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P60_S9	No assurances can be given that we will continue to be competitive in the future.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	Backlog We schedule production of our systems based upon order backlog and informal customer forecasts.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P61_S1	We include in backlog only those orders to which the customer has assigned a purchase order number and for which delivery is anticipated within 12 months.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P61_S2	Because shipment dates may be changed and customers may cancel or delay orders with little or no penalty, our backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P61_S3	At December 31, 2016 , we had a backlog of approximately $41.6 million compared with a backlog of approximately $54.0 million at December 31, 2015 .
1094392_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	Employees As of December 31, 2016 , we had 579 employees.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P62_S1	Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements, and we have never experienced a work stoppage.
1094392_17_ITEM1_P62_S2	We believe our employee relations are good.

1094392_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Risks Related to Rudolph Our operating results have varied, and will likely continue to vary significantly, from quarter to quarter in the future, causing volatility in our stock price Our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and will likely continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, causing volatility in our stock price.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Some of the factors that may influence our operating results and subject our stock to extreme price and volume fluctuations include:
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	the levels of our fixed expenses, including research and development costs associated with product development, relative to our revenue levels.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In light of these factors and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Moreover, many of our expenses are fixed in the short-term which, together with the need for continued investment in research and development, marketing and customer support, limits our ability to reduce expenses quickly.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	As a result, declines in net sales could harm our business and the price of our common stock could substantially decline.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our largest customers account for a significant portion of our revenues, and our revenues and cash flows could significantly decline if one or more of these customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems or they delayed or canceled a large order Sales to end user customers that individually represent at least five percent of our revenues typically account for, in the aggregate, a considerable amount of our revenues.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We operate in the highly concentrated, capital-intensive semiconductor device manufacturing industry.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Historically, a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers, and this trend is expected to continue.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	If any of our key customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems in the future, or if they delay or cancel a large order, our revenues and cash flows could significantly decline.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We expect that we will continue to depend on a small number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenues.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P2_S4	In addition, as large semiconductor device manufacturers seek to establish closer relationships with their suppliers, we expect that our customer base will become even more concentrated.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Our customers may be unable to pay us for our products and services Our customers include some companies that may from time to time encounter financial difficulties, especially in light of the current economic environment and the difficulties in the credit markets.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P2_S6	If a customer s financial difficulties become severe, the customer may be unwilling or unable to pay our invoices in the ordinary course of business, which could adversely affect collections of both our accounts receivable balance and unbilled services.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P2_S7	The bankruptcy of a customer with a substantial account receivable could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P2_S8	In addition, if a customer declares bankruptcy after paying us certain invoices, a court may determine that we are not properly entitled to that payment and may require repayment of some or all of the amount we received, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our systems may cause fluctuations in our operating results, which could cause our stock price to decline Variations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our revenues and cash flows, and consequently, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, to fluctuate widely from period to period.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	This variation could cause our stock price to decline.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our customers generally take a long time to evaluate our inspection and/or film metrology systems and many people are involved in the evaluation process.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	We expend significant resources educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our systems in the semiconductor fabrication process.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	The length of time it takes for us to make a sale depends upon many factors including, but not limited to:
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	the quality and sophistication of the customer s current metrology, inspection or lithography equipment.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Because of the number of factors influencing the sales process, the period between our initial contact with a customer and the time when we recognize revenue from that customer and receive payment, if ever, varies widely in length.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our sales cycles, including the time it takes for us to build a product to customer specifications after receiving an order to the time we recognize revenue, typically range from six to twenty-four months.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Sometimes our sales cycles can be much longer, particularly with customers in Japan.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	During these cycles, we commit substantial resources to our sales efforts in advance of receiving any revenue, and we may never receive any revenue from a customer despite our sales efforts.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P5_S4	If we do make a sale, our customers often purchase only one of our systems, and then evaluate its performance for a lengthy period before purchasing any more of our systems.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P5_S5	The number of additional products a customer purchases, if any, depends on many factors, including the customer s capacity requirements.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P5_S6	The period between a customer s initial purchase and any subsequent purchases can vary from six months to a year or longer, and variations in the length of this period could cause further fluctuations in our operating results and possibly in our stock price.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Most of our revenues have been derived from customers outside of the United States subjecting us to operational, financial and political risks, such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs, political and economic instability, outbreaks of hostilities, and difficulties in managing foreign sales representatives and foreign branch operations as well as risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations Due to the significant level of our international sales, we are subject to a number of material risks, including: Compliance with foreign laws.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our business is subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally, including compliance with, inconsistencies among, and unexpected changes in, a wide variety of foreign laws and regulatory environments with which we are not familiar, including, among other issues, with respect to employees, protection of our intellectual property, and a wide variety of operational regulations and trade and export controls under domestic, foreign, and international law.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including tariffs and other market barriers.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The semiconductor device industry is a high-visibility industry in many of the European and Asian countries in which we sell our products.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Because the governments of these countries have provided extensive financial support to our semiconductor device manufacturing customers in these countries, we believe that our customers could be disproportionately affected by any trade embargoes, excise taxes or other restrictions imposed by their governments on trade with United States companies such as ourselves.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Any restrictions of these types could result in a reduction in our sales to customers in these countries.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We are subject to various global risks related to political and economic instabilities in countries in which we derive sales.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If terrorist activities, armed conflict, civil or military unrest or political instability occurs outside of the U.S., these events may result in reduced demand for our products.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	There is considerable political instability in Taiwan related to its disputes with China and in South Korea related to its disputes with North Korea.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In addition, several Asian countries, particularly Japan, have experienced significant economic instability.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	outbreak of hostilities or other political upheaval in China, Taiwan or South Korea, or an economic downturn in Japan or other countries, would likely harm the operations of our customers in these countries.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The effect of these types of events on our revenues and cash flows could be material because we derive substantial revenues from sales to semiconductor device foundries in Taiwan such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd., from memory chip manufacturers in South Korea such as Samsung, and from semiconductor device manufacturers in Japan such as Toshiba.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign branch operations.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	During periods of tension between the governments of the United States and certain other countries, it is often difficult for United States companies such as ourselves to staff and manage operations in such countries.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Language and other cultural differences may also inhibit our sales and marketing efforts and create internal communication problems among our U.S. and foreign research and development teams, increasing the difficulty of managing multiple, remote locations performing various development, quality assurance, and yield ramp analysis projects.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Currency fluctuations as compared to the U.S. Dollar.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	A substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	As a result, if the dollar rises in value in relation to foreign currencies, our systems will become more expensive to customers outside the United States and less competitive with systems produced by competitors outside the United States.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P12_S3	These conditions could negatively impact our international sales.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Foreign sales also expose us to collection risk in the event it becomes more expensive for our foreign customers to convert their local currencies into U.S. dollars.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Additionally, in the event a larger portion of our revenue becomes denominated in foreign currencies, we would be subject to a potentially significant exchange rate risk.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P12_S6	If we deliver systems with defects, our credibility will be harmed and the sales and market acceptance of our systems will decrease Our systems are complex and have occasionally contained errors, defects and bugs when introduced.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing or general handling, and can have a major impact on device and process quality.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	When this occurs, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our systems could be harmed.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Further, if our systems contain errors, defects or bugs, computer viruses or malicious code as a result of cyber attacks to our computer networks, we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate these problems.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Defects could also lead to product liability as a result of product liability lawsuits against us or against our customers.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We have agreed to indemnify our customers under certain circumstances against liability arising from defects in our systems.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Our product liability policy currently provides $2.0 million of aggregate coverage, with an overall umbrella limit of $20.0 million .
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	In the event of a successful product liability claim, we could be obligated to pay damages significantly in excess of our product liability insurance limits.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	If we are not successful in developing new and enhanced products for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry, we will lose sales and market share to our competitors We operate in an industry that is highly competitive and subject to evolving industry standards, rapid technological changes, rapid changes in consumer demands and the rapid introduction of new, higher performance systems with shorter product life cycles.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	To be competitive in our demanding market, we must continually design, develop and introduce in a timely manner new lithography, inspection and metrology process control systems that meet the performance and price demands of semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We must also continue to refine our current systems so that they remain competitive.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We expect to continue to make significant investments in our research and development activities.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	We may experience difficulties or delays in our development efforts with respect to new systems, and we may not ultimately be successful in our product enhancement efforts to improve and advance products or in responding effectively to technological change, as not all research and development activities result in viable commercial products.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to develop new products for the most opportunistic new markets and applications.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Any significant delay in releasing new systems could cause our products to become obsolete, adversely affect our reputation, give a competitor a first-to-market advantage or cause a competitor to achieve greater market share.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P15_S7	In addition, new product offerings that are highly complex in terms of software or hardware may require application or service work such as bug fixing prior to acceptance, thereby delaying revenue recognition.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If new products developed by us do not gain general market acceptance, we will be unable to generate revenues and recover our research and development costs Inspection, lithography and metrology product development is inherently risky because it is difficult to foresee developments in semiconductor device manufacturing technology, coordinate technical personnel, and identify and eliminate system design flaws.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Further, our products are complex and often the applications to our customers businesses are unique.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Any new systems we introduce may not achieve or sustain a significant degree of market acceptance and sales.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources developing new systems and refining our existing systems.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S4	In light of the long product development cycles inherent in our industry, these expenditures will be made well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenue from the sale of those systems.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market new systems are subject to a wide variety of challenges during the development cycle, including start-up bugs, design defects, and other matters that could delay introduction of these systems.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S6	In addition, since our customers are not obligated by long-term contracts to purchase our systems, our anticipated product orders may not materialize, or orders that are placed may be canceled.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S7	As a result, if we do not achieve market acceptance of new products, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows to recover our research and development costs and our market share, revenue, operating results or stock price would be negatively impacted.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S8	Even if we are able to develop new products that gain market acceptance, sales of these new products could impair our ability to sell existing products Competition from our new systems could have a negative effect on sales of our existing systems and the prices that we could charge for these systems.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S9	We may also divert sales and marketing resources from our current systems in order to successfully launch and promote our new or next generation systems.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S10	This diversion of resources could have a further negative effect on sales of our current systems and the value of inventory.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S11	If our relationships with our large customers deteriorate, our product development activities could be adversely affected The success of our product development efforts depends on our ability to anticipate market trends and the price, performance and functionality requirements of semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S12	In order to anticipate these trends and ensure that critical development projects proceed in a coordinated manner, we must continue to collaborate closely with our largest customers.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S13	Our relationships with these and other customers provide us with access to valuable information regarding trends in the semiconductor device industry, which enables us to better plan our product development activities.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S14	If our current relationships with our large customers are impaired, or if we are unable to develop similar collaborative relationships with important customers in the future, our product development activities could be adversely affected.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S15	Our ability to reduce costs is limited by our ongoing need to invest in research and development and to provide customer support activities Our industry is characterized by the need for continual investment in research and development as well as customer service and support.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S16	As a result, our operating results could be materially affected if operating costs associated with our research and development as well as customer support activities increase in the future or we are unable to reduce those activities.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S17	We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property and, therefore, lose our competitive advantage Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology for our principal product families, and we rely, in part, on patent and trade secret law and confidentiality agreements to protect that technology.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S18	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it will give our competitors a significant advantage.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S19	We own or have licensed a number of patents relating to our transparent and opaque thin film metrology, lithography and macro-defect inspection systems, and have filed applications for additional patents.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S20	Any of our pending patent applications may be rejected, and we may be unable to develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable in the future.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In addition, the patents that we do own or that have been issued or licensed to us may not provide us with competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Further, third parties may also design around these patents.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In addition to patent protection, we rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and technology.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and other third parties.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Even though these agreements are in place there can be no assurances that trade secrets and proprietary information will not be disclosed, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, or that we can fully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Violations by others of our confidentiality agreements and the loss of employees who have specialized knowledge and expertise could harm our competitive position and cause our sales and operating results to decline as a result of increased competition.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Costly and time-consuming litigation might be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection might adversely affect our ability to continue our research or bring products to market.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Protection of our intellectual property rights, or the efforts of third parties to enforce their own intellectual property rights against us, may result in costly and time-consuming litigation, substantial damages, lost product sales and/or the loss of important intellectual property rights We may be required to initiate litigation in order to enforce any patents issued to or licensed by us, or to determine the scope or validity of a third party s patent or other proprietary rights.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Any litigation, regardless of outcome, could be expensive and time consuming, and could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to re-engineer our products or obtain expensive licenses from third parties.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S7	There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S8	In addition, our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S9	From time to time, we may receive communications from third parties asserting that our products or systems infringe, or may infringe, the proprietary rights of these third parties.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S10	These claims of infringement may lead to protracted and costly litigation, which could require us to pay substantial damages or have the sale of our products or systems stopped by an injunction.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S11	Infringement claims could also cause product or system delays or require us to redesign our products or systems, and these delays could result in the loss of substantial revenues.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S12	We may also be required to obtain a license from the third party or cease activities utilizing the third party s proprietary rights.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S13	We may not be able to enter into such a license or such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S14	Accordingly, the loss of important intellectual property rights could hinder our ability to sell our systems, or make the sale of these systems more expensive.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S15	For additional information regarding recent patent litigation, see Item 3.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in certain foreign countries, where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the United States The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement abroad.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	For example, Taiwan is not a signatory of the Patent Cooperation Treaty, which is designed to specify rules and methods for defending intellectual property internationally.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	The publication of a patent in Taiwan prior to the filing of a patent in Taiwan would invalidate the ability of a company to obtain a patent in Taiwan.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Similarly, in contrast to the United States where the contents of patents remain confidential during the patent application process, in Taiwan the contents of a patent are published upon filing which provides competitors an advance view of the contents of a patent application prior to the establishment of patent rights.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Consequently, there is a risk that we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights in certain foreign countries.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P19_S5	If this occurs, it would be easier for our competitors to develop and sell competing products in these countries.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Some of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, and increased competition could impair sales of our products or cause us to reduce our prices The market for semiconductor capital equipment is highly competitive.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P19_S7	We face substantial competition from established companies in each of the markets we serve.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P19_S8	We principally compete with KLA-Tencor, Camtek and Ultratech.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P19_S9	We compete to a lesser extent with companies such as Nanometrics, Nova Measurement Instruments and Nikon.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P19_S10	Each of our products also competes with products that use different metrology, inspection or lithography techniques.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, broader product offerings and service capabilities and larger installed customer bases than we do.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or market developments by devoting greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products, which, in turn, could impair sales of our products.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Further, there may be significant merger and acquisition activity among our competitors and potential competitors, which, in turn, may provide them with a competitive advantage over us by enabling them to rapidly expand their product offerings and service capabilities to meet a broader range of customer needs.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Many of our customers and potential customers in the semiconductor device manufacturing industry are large companies that require global support and service for their semiconductor capital equipment.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We believe that our global support and service infrastructure is sufficient to meet the needs of our customers and potential customers.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	However, some of our competitors have more extensive infrastructures than we do, which could place us at a disadvantage when competing for the business of global semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Many of our competitors are investing heavily in the development of new systems that will compete directly with our systems.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P21_S4	We have from time to time selectively reduced prices on our systems in order to protect our market share, and competitive pressures may necessitate further price reductions.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P21_S5	We expect our competitors in each product area to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices and performance characteristics.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P21_S6	These product introductions would likely require us to decrease the prices of our systems and increase the level of discounts that we grant our customers.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Price reductions or lost sales as a result of these competitive pressures would reduce our total revenues and could adversely impact our financial results.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We believe that once a semiconductor device manufacturer has selected one vendor s capital equipment for a production-line application, the manufacturer generally relies upon that capital equipment and, to the extent possible, subsequent generations of the same vendor s equipment, for the life of the application.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Once a vendor s equipment has been installed in a production line application, a semiconductor device manufacturer must often make substantial technical modifications and may experience production-line downtime in order to switch to another vendor s equipment.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Accordingly, unless our systems offer performance or cost advantages that outweigh a customer s expense of switching to our systems, it will be difficult for us to achieve significant sales to that manufacturer once it has selected another vendor s capital equipment for an application.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key executive management, engineering, sales and marketing, customer support, finance and manufacturing personnel.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P22_S4	The loss of any of these key personnel through resignations, retirement or other circumstances, each of whom would be extremely difficult to replace, could harm our business and operating results.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Although we have employment and noncompetition agreements with key members of our senior management team, these individuals or other key employees may still leave us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P22_S6	We do not have key person life insurance on any of our executives.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P22_S7	In addition, to support our future growth, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P22_S8	Competition for such personnel in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified employees.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P22_S9	We obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a limited group of suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenues We obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a limited group of suppliers and do not have long-term contracts with many of our suppliers.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P22_S10	Our dependence on limited source suppliers of components and our lack of long-term contracts with many of our suppliers exposes us to several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components, price increases, late deliveries and poor component quality.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P22_S11	Disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our systems, damage our customer relationships and reduce our sales.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	From time to time in the past, we have experienced temporary difficulties in receiving shipments from our suppliers.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In addition, the lead time required to qualify new suppliers for lasers and certain optics could be as long as a year, and the lead time required to qualify new suppliers of other components could be as long as nine months.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	If we are unable to accurately predict our component needs, or if our component supply is disrupted, we may miss market opportunities by not being able to meet the demand for our systems.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Further, a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components or subassemblies could seriously harm our results of operations and cash flows.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility could have a material adverse effect on our revenues Our manufacturing processes are highly complex and require sophisticated and costly equipment and a specially designed facility.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S3	As a result, any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, or destruction of or damage as a result of a fire or any other reason, could seriously harm our ability to satisfy our customer order deadlines.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S4	If we cannot timely deliver our systems, our results from operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Cybersecurity attacks could include, but are not limited to, malicious software, viruses, attempts to gain unauthorized access, whether through malfeasance or error, either from within or outside of our organization, to our data or that of our customers or our customers customers which may be in our possession, and the unauthorized release, corruption or loss of the data, loss of the intellectual property, theft of the proprietary or licensed technology, whether ours, that of our customers or their customers, loss or damage to our data delivery systems, other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in our critical systems, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S7	It is possible that our business, financial and other systems could be compromised, which might not be noticed for some period of time.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S8	Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks are evolving and unpredictable and we cannot guarantee that any risk prevention measures implemented will be successful.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S9	The occurrence of such an attack could lead to financial losses and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S10	Our earnings could be negatively affected and our inventory levels could materially increase if we are unable to predict our inventory needs in an accurate and timely manner and adjust our orders for parts and subcomponents should our needs increase or decrease materially due to unexpected increases or decreases in demand for our products.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S11	Any material increase in our inventories could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, while any material decrease in our ability to procure needed inventories could result in an inability to supply customer demand for our products, thus adversely affecting our revenues.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S12	Our ability to fulfill our backlog may have an effect on our long term ability to procure contracts and fulfill current contracts Our ability to fulfill our backlog may be limited by our ability to devote sufficient financial and human capital resources and limited by available material supplies.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S13	If we do not fulfill our backlog in a timely manner, we may experience delays in product delivery which would postpone receipt of revenue from those delayed deliveries.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S14	Additionally, if we are consistently unable to fulfill our backlog, this may be a disincentive to customers to award large contracts to us in the future until they are comfortable that we can effectively manage our backlog.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S15	We may choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves, and may be unable to complete these acquisitions or may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired business in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner Our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions, and from time to time acquiring one or more businesses, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We may choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products, technologies and/or services instead of developing them ourselves.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We may, however, face competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established companies with greater financial resources, making it more difficult for us to complete acquisitions.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from one or more acquisitions that we consummate.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Integrating any business, product technology or service we acquire could be expensive and time-consuming and/or disrupt our ongoing business.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Further, there are numerous risks associated with acquisitions and potential acquisitions, including but not limited to:
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	unexpected reduction of sales of existing products by new products.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such favorable terms or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations, including as a result of our incurrence of indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In order to finance any acquisitions, we might need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In that event, we could be forced to obtain financing on terms that are not favorable to us and, in the case of equity financing, that result in dilution to our stockholders.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In addition, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, amortization of intangible assets, write-down of other assets or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions and purchase accounting could harm our business and operating results.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P28_S3	If we cannot effectively manage growth, our business may suffer Over the long-term, we intend to grow our business by increasing our sales efforts and completing strategic acquisitions.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P28_S4	To effectively manage growth, we must, among other things:
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	administer appropriate financial and administrative control procedures.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Growth of our business will likely place a significant strain on our management, financial, operational, technical, sales and administrative resources.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Any failure to effectively manage our growth may cause our business to suffer and our stock price to decline.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Changes in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect results As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Our future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the (1) applicable tax laws; (2) composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates; or (3) recoverability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P31_S4	We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, released guidance covering various topics, including country-by-country reporting, definitional changes to permanent establishment and Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, or BEPS, an initiative that aims to standardize and modernize global tax policy.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Depending on the final form of guidance adopted by OECD members and legislation ultimately enacted, if any, there may be significant consequences for us due to our international business activities.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Turmoil or fluctuations in the credit markets and the financial services industry may negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity During recent years, global credit markets and the financial services industry have experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by tightening of the credit markets, weakening of the global economy and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States and other governments.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Adverse economic conditions, such as sustained periods of economic uncertainty or a crisis in the financial markets may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition if our ability to obtain credit from the capital financial markets or from trade creditors were to be impaired.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P33_S4	In addition, a worsening economy or an economic crisis could also adversely impact our customers ability to finance the purchase of systems from us or our suppliers ability to provide us with product, either of which may negatively impact our business and results of operations.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers On August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	These regulations require companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Our most recent such report was filed with the SEC on May 27, 2015.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	These regulations could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, including our products.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P34_S4	In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P34_S6	In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our operating results are subject to significant variation due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor device industry.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor device manufacturers, which, in turn, depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In recent years, the industry has experienced significant downturns, generally in connection with declines in economic conditions.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	This cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and, thus, future expense levels.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P37_S3	During a down cycle, we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P37_S4	In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P37_S5	We can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P37_S6	If we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business could be seriously harmed.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our future rate of growth is highly dependent on the development and growth of the market for microelectronic device inspection, lithography and metrology equipment We target our products to address the needs of microelectronic device manufacturers for defect inspection, metrology and lithography.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If for any reason the market for microelectronic device inspection, lithography or metrology equipment fails to grow in the long term, we may be unable to maintain current revenue levels in the short term and maintain our historical growth in the long term.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Growth in the inspection market is dependent to a large extent upon microelectronic manufacturers replacing manual inspection with automated inspection technology.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Growth in the metrology market is dependent to a large extent upon new chip designs and capacity expansion of microelectronic manufacturers.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Growth in the lithography market is dependent on the development of cost-effective packaging with high fine pitch redistribution layers (RDL), ultimately migrating to multi-die, large, form-factor packages.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P39_S3	There is no assurance that manufacturers will undertake these actions at the rate we expect.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Risks Related to our Stock Provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and/or delay, deter or prevent a change in control of our company Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board of Directors.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P39_S5	These provisions also limit the circumstances in which a premium can be paid for the common stock, and in which a proxy contest for control of our board may be initiated.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	the authority of our board, without stockholder approval, to adopt a stockholder rights plan.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Such a stockholder rights plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on June 27, 2005 and expired on June 28, 2015.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We are also entitled to avail ourselves of the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could inhibit changes in control of us.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our stock price is volatile The market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	From the beginning of 2012 through the end of 2016 , our stock price fluctuated between a high of $24.45 per share and a low of $8.09 per share.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Factors affecting our stock price may include:
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	the number of firms making a market in our common stock.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	In addition, the stock market has experienced periods of significant price and volume fluctuations.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	These fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high technology companies like ours.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Any such market fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	There are various risks related to the legal and regulatory environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business that may expose us to risk We are faced with various risks which may be associated with our compliance with existing, new, different, inconsistent or conflicting laws, regulations and rules enacted by governments and/or their regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate as well as rules and policies implemented at our customer sites.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	These laws, regulations, rules and policies could relate to any of an array of issues including, but not limited to, environmental, tax, intellectual property, trade secrets, product liability, contracts, antitrust, employment, securities, import/export and unfair competition.
1094392_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Should we fail to comply with or violate U.S. or foreign laws or regulations or customer policies, we could be subject to civil or criminal claims or proceedings that may result in monetary fines, penalties or other costs against us or our employees that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, customer relations and ability to conduct our business.
1094392_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal executive office building is located at 16 Jonspin Road in Wilmington, Massachusetts.
1094392_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own and lease facilities for corporate, engineering, manufacturing, sales and service related purposes in the United States and six other countries China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Scotland.
1094392_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	The following table indicates the location, the general purpose and the square footage of our principal facilities.
1094392_17_ITEM2_P0_S3	The expiration years of the leases covering the leased facilities are also indicated.
1094392_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	We also lease office space for other smaller sales and service offices in several locations throughout the world.
1094392_17_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our existing facilities and capital equipment are adequate to meet our current requirements, and that suitable additional or substitute space is available on commercially reasonable terms if needed.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	The following reflects an overview of the material activities with regard to these matters.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P1_S0	Integrated Technology Corporation v. Rudolph Technologies, Inc., No. CV-06-2182 (PHX-ROS) :
1094392_17_ITEM3_P2_S0	The sole remaining issue in this case was the determination and payment of remanded attorney s fees which were initially set by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona (the AZ District Court ) at $3.3 million.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P2_S1	Subsequent to our successful appeal before the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals, the matter was remanded back to the AZ District Court for a determination of a proper fee award.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P2_S2	On October 5, 2016, the AZ District Court issued an order determining that we are to pay $1.3 million to ITC for its attorney s fees.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P2_S3	The payment was made in November of 2016 and this matter is now closed.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P3_S0	August Technology Corporation and Rudolph Technologies, Inc. v. Camtek, Ltd., No. 05-CV-01396 (JRT/FLN) :
1094392_17_ITEM3_P3_S1	Subsequent to the ruling by the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota (the MN District Court ) in our favor that Camtek s Falcon tools continue to infringe our patent under the revised claim construction of the patent determined by the Court of Appeals, the MN District Court, on February 9, 2015, issued an Order granting our Motion for Final Judgment, reinstating the original damages and applying prejudgment interest for a total award of $14.5 million.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P3_S2	In addition, the MN District Court issued a permanent injunction against Camtek from making, using, selling and offering to sell any of its Falcon machines and any machines that are colorable imitations thereof in the United States, intended for sale and use within the United States, until the expiration of the 6,298 patent, which is projected to be in 2020.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P4_S0	While, in March of 2015, Camtek filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals challenging the MN District Court s ruling, the Court of Appeals denied Camtek s appeal on February 3, 2016, affirming both the infringement ruling and the damages and interest totaling approximately $14.6 million assessed against Camtek by the MN District Court, the payment of which is guaranteed by a supersedeas bond.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P4_S1	All of Camtek s rights to appeal the final judgment have expired.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P4_S2	On July 22, 2016, the MN District Court ordered that the full amount of the judgment be paid to us.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P4_S3	With the payment of the final judgment amount on August 11, 2016, this matter has been closed.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P5_S0	August Technology Corporation and Rudolph Technologies, Inc. v. Camtek, Ltd., No. 11-CV-03707 (MJD/TNL) : A lawsuit against Camtek, Ltd., of Migdal Hamek, Israel, was filed by us in 2011 alleging infringement of its U.S. Patent No. 7,729,528 related to our proprietary continuous scan wafer inspection technology.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P5_S1	Camtek filed an inter partes reexamination petition with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the PTO ) on January 19, 2012 asserting that certain claims of the patent are unpatentable.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P5_S2	In the course of this proceeding the PTO issued a final determination that 35 claims of the patent were valid and 18 claims were rejected.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P6_S0	We appealed the PTO s rejection of the 18 claims to the US.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P6_S1	On December 22, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the PTO s rejection of three of the 18 patent claims and affirmed the PTO s rejection of nine of the 18 patent claims.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P6_S2	The appeal of the remaining six patent claims was dismissed for procedural reasons.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P6_S3	Thus, 38 claims are available to be asserted under the 528 patent in this lawsuit.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P7_S0	During the pendency of the reexamination process, the parties have stipulated that the lawsuit be stayed.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P7_S1	With resolution of Camtek s petition, it is intended to lift the stay in the lawsuit in Q1 2017.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P8_S0	No. 6,826,298 by Camtek s Eagle product with the U.S. District Court in Minnesota.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P8_S1	The 6,298 patent is also related to our proprietary continuous scan wafer inspection technology and was the subject of Rudolph s prior litigation against the Camtek Falcon system (the Falcon Litigation ) in which Rudolph prevailed with a final judgment of infringement and damages of $14.6 million assessed against Camtek.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P8_S2	On April 21, 2015, we filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction to enjoin Camtek s sale of the Eagle device in the United States.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P9_S0	On or about April 20, 2015, Camtek filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey seeking a declaratory judgment challenging the jurisdiction and venue of the Minnesota District Court and seeking to have the New Jersey District Court find that the 6,298 patent is not infringed and, in the alternative, that the 6,298 patent is invalid.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P9_S1	On August 26, 2015, the U.S. District Court in Minnesota ruled that Minnesota jurisdiction was appropriate for this matter while at the same time denying our Motion for Preliminary Injunction.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P9_S2	Camtek s complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey was subsequently dismissed.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P9_S3	On August 8, 2016 the Minnesota District Court issued an order regarding motions for partial summary judgment which we had filed in March of 2016 granting (i) that the 6,298 patent is valid and Camtek is precluded from contesting its validity at trial, and (ii) that the claim constructions adopted in the Falcon Litigation for four terms are entitled to a preclusive effect and will apply in the course of the present litigation.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P9_S4	The Minnesota District Court also ruled that three phrases not subject to claim construction in the Falcon Litigation may be defined in the present case.
1094392_17_ITEM3_P9_S5	This matter is currently ongoing in the U.S. District Court in Minnesota with no trial date set.

1094392_17_ITEM6_P2_S0	(1) Effective in the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires entities to present debt issuance costs related to a debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability on the balance sheet as opposed to being presented as a deferred charge.
1094392_17_ITEM6_P2_S1	Prior to adoption, the Company reported the unamortized debt issuance costs in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1094392_17_ITEM6_P2_S2	(2) Effective December 31, 2015, we early adopted provisions prescribed by the Financial Account Standards Board (FASB) in Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.
1094392_17_ITEM6_P2_S3	Consequently, we reclassified net current deferred income tax assets to net long term deferred income tax assets for each period presented.
1094392_17_ITEM6_P2_S4	(3) Working capital data for 2012 through 2014 reflect reclassifications of a portion of deferred revenue to other non-current liabilities.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview We are a worldwide leader in the design, development, manufacture and support of process control defect inspection and metrology, advanced packaging lithography, and data analysis systems and software used by microelectronic device manufacturers.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	We provide process and yield management solutions used in both wafer processing and final manufacturing through a family of standalone systems for macro-defect inspection, lithography, probe card test and analysis, and transparent and opaque thin film measurements.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	All of our systems feature sophisticated software and production-worthy automation.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P0_S3	Our systems are backed by worldwide customer service and applications support.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Rudolph s business is affected by the annual spending patterns of our customers on semiconductor capital equipment.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	The amount that our customers devote to capital equipment spending depends on a number of factors, including general worldwide economic conditions as well as other economic drivers such as personal computer, tablet, cell phone, other personal electronic devices and automotive sales.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	Current forecasts by industry analysts for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry projects a year-over-year increase in capital equipment spending of approximately 4%-8% for 2017.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our revenues and profitability tend to follow the trends of certain segments within the semiconductor market.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	We monitor capital equipment spending through announced capital spending plans by our customers and monthly-published industry data such as the book-to-bill ratio.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	The book-to-bill ratio is a 3-month running statistic that compares bookings or orders placed with capital equipment suppliers to billings or shipments.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P2_S3	A book-to-bill ratio above 1.0 shows that semiconductor device equipment manufacturers are ordering equipment at a pace that exceeds the equipment suppliers shipments for the period.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P2_S4	The three month rolling average North American semiconductor equipment book-to-bill ratio was 1.1 for the month of December 2016 , unchanged from the September 2016 book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 .
1094392_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Historically, a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers, and we expect this trend to continue.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , sales to customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for 34.5% , 23.3% , and 23.9% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	We do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products, and they could cease purchasing products from us at any time.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	A delay in purchase or cancellation by any of our large customers could cause quarterly revenues to vary significantly.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	In addition, during a given quarter, a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P4_S3	The following table presents the average selling price range for our systems in 2016 .
1094392_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	A significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customers outside of the United States.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	A substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in U.S dollars.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	We expect that revenues generated from customers outside of the United States will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P5_S3	The sales cycle for our systems typically ranges from six to twenty-four months, and can be longer when our customers are evaluating new technology.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P5_S4	Due to the length of these cycles, we invest significantly in research and development and sales and marketing in advance of generating revenues related to these investments.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our statements of operations data as percentages of our revenues.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our results of operations are reported as one business segment.

1094392_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	We may fund all or a portion of the purchase price of these acquisitions in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	In January 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 3.0 million shares of the Company s common stock with no established end date.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P21_S3	The authorization allows for repurchases to be made in the open market or through negotiated transactions from time to time.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P21_S4	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 , we repurchased 0.6 million shares of common stock.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P21_S5	At December 31, 2016 , there were 0.7 million shares available for future stock repurchases under this repurchase authorization.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P21_S6	Shares of common stock purchased under the share repurchase authorization are retired.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P21_S7	For further information, see Note 15 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	We have a credit agreement with a bank that provides for a line of credit which is secured by the marketable securities we have with the bank.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	We are permitted to borrow up to 70% of the value of eligible securities held at the time the line of credit is accessed.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	The available line of credit as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $68.3 million .
1094392_17_ITEM7_P22_S3	We entered into our current credit agreement and concurrently terminated a prior credit agreement in June 2016.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P22_S4	The credit agreement is available to us until such time that either party terminates the arrangement at their discretion.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P22_S5	We have not utilized the line of credit to date.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P22_S6	Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and amount of our revenues and our investment decisions, which will affect our ability to generate additional cash.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P22_S7	We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs for the next twelve months.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P22_S8	Thereafter, if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements, we may seek additional funding through bank borrowings, sales of securities or other means.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P22_S9	There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us or at all.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2016 , and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	This table excludes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits that totaled approximately $4.8 million at December 31, 2016 .
1094392_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	We are currently unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount or periods when cash settlement of this liability may occur.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	The Company does not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity and capital resources.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Critical Accounting Policies Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	We review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P25_S3	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, business acquisitions, intangible assets, share-based payments, income taxes and warranty obligations.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P25_S4	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P25_S5	Results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P25_S6	These estimates and judgments are regularly reviewed by management on an ongoing basis at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P25_S7	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Revenue is recognized provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	Revenue recognition generally results at the following points: (1) for all transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment for all products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment; the portion of revenue associated with certain installation-related tasks is deferred, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation-related tasks; (2) for products that have not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized at customer technical acceptance; (3) for transactions with multiple elements, such as sales of products that include software and services, the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred using the relative selling price method utilizing vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) or estimated sales prices ( ESP ) until delivery of the deferred elements.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Third-party evidence is not typically used to determine selling prices as to limited availability of reliable competitor products selling prices.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	The ESP is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, gross margin objectives, internal costs and competitor pricing strategies.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	Revenues from parts sales are recognized at the time of shipment.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	Revenue from training and service contracts is recognized ratably over the training period and contract period.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	A provision for the estimated cost of fulfilling warranty obligations is recorded at the time the related revenue is recognized.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P29_S3	Revenue from software license fees is recognized upon shipment or customer acknowledgment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and VSOE exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P29_S4	License support and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P29_S5	Deferred revenue represents undelivered items, prepaid service contract revenue and prepaid license support and maintenance revenue.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P29_S6	Deferred revenue is recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policies described above.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	We specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if our assumptions are otherwise incorrect, additional allowances may be required.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P30_S3	We maintain reserves for our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product life-cycles, product demand and market conditions.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P30_S4	If actual product life-cycles, product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those originally projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	We account for acquired or merged businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition or merger at their respective fair values.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	Accordingly, for significant acquisitions, we typically obtain assistance from independent valuation specialists.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	There are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	For intangible assets, we typically utilize the income method.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the projected future cash flows (including timing) and the discount rate reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flows.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	For example, different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	All of these judgments and estimates can significantly impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P35_S3	Our formal annual impairment testing date for goodwill is October 31 st or prior to the next annual testing date if an event occurs or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	If, we elect this option and after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P36_S2	We have not elected this option to date.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process which requires us to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	The first step consists of estimating the fair value of our aggregated reporting unit using the market value of our common stock at October 31 st , multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares (market capitalization) and an implied control premium as if it were to be acquired by a single stockholder.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	We obtain information on completed sales of similar companies in a comparable industry to estimate an implied control premium for us.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	We compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value which includes goodwill.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P38_S3	If the results of the initial market capitalization test produce results which are below the reporting unit carrying value, we will also consider if the market capitalization is temporarily low and, if so, we may also perform a discounted cash flow test.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the second step is completed to compute the impairment amount by determining the implied fair value of goodwill.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	This determination requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	Any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill which is compared to the corresponding carrying value to compute the goodwill impairment amount.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	We are not required to perform the second step during our annual impairment test.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Long-Lived Assets and Acquired Intangible Assets.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	We periodically review long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and the impairment of such long-lived assets, if any, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	No such indicators were noted in 2016 .
1094392_17_ITEM7_P42_S3	We are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our share grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P42_S4	If the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	While we engage in product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P44_S3	Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	The need for a valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred taxes will be recoverable.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, we may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had valuation allowances of $1.9 million and $2.2 million on certain of our deferred tax assets to reflect, the deferred tax assets at the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P45_S3	We evaluated the realizability of the deferred tax assets based on positive earnings from 2014 through 2016 as well as the projected earnings in future years and believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized in the future years.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P45_S4	We will continue to monitor the realizability of the deferred tax assets and evaluate the valuation allowance.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	The first step requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that the tax position has met the threshold for recognition; therefore, we must evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	The second step requires us to measure the tax benefit of the tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized when effectively settled.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P46_S3	This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P46_S4	We reevaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues, and new audit activity.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P46_S5	Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P46_S6	Although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P46_S7	If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, it could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	This ASU would eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	The ASU is effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P47_S3	We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of ASU No. 2017-04 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Tax (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	This ASU which is part of the Board s simplification initiative, is intended to reduce the complexity of U.S. GAAP and diversity in practice related to the tax consequences of certain types of intra-entity asset transfers, particularly those involving intellectual property.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P48_S3	We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-16 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	This ASU provides guidance on statement of cash flows presentation for eight specific cash flow issues where diversity in practice exists.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P49_S3	We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), which introduces new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on instruments within its scope.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	Given the breadth of that scope, the new ASU will impact both financial services and non-financial services entities.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P50_S3	We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	The standard was issued as part of the Simplification Initiative which involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P51_S2	The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).
1094392_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	The standard requires that lessees will be required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P53_S2	ASU No. 2016-02 also will require disclosures designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P53_S3	These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative information.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P53_S4	The standard is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018 with earlier adoption permitted.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	We are in the process of evaluating the effects the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330), Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	This ASU is intended to simplify subsequent measurement of inventory.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	An entity should measure inventory within the scope of this ASU at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P55_S3	Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal, and transportation.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P55_S4	The standard is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
1094392_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	ASU No. 2014-09, as amended, outlines a comprehensive revenue recognition model and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance as amended.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	In July 2015, the FASB deferred for one year the effective date of the new revenue standard.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P57_S3	The standard is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 with earlier adoption permitted.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P57_S4	ASU No. 2014-09 allows for two methods of adoption: (a) full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented, or (b) modified retrospective adoption, meaning the cumulative effect of applying ASU No. 2014-09 is recognized as an adjustment to the 2018 opening retained earnings balance.
1094392_17_ITEM7_P57_S5	We are in the process of determining the adoption method as well as the effects the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate and Credit Market Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates and market liquidity including our investments in certain available-for-sale securities.
1094392_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our available-for-sale securities consist of fixed and variable rate debt investments (municipal notes and bonds).
1094392_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates, market liquidity and credit ratings of issuers from our available-for-sale securities.
1094392_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	It is possible that we are at risk if interest rates, market liquidity or credit ratings of issuers change in an unfavorable direction.
1094392_17_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The magnitude of any gain or loss will be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.
1094392_17_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our financial investments held as of December 31, 2016 , an immediate adverse change of 10% in interest rates (e.g. 3.00% to 3.30%) would result in an immaterial decrease in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities.
1094392_17_ITEM7A_P0_S6	Therefore, any change in interest rates will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1094392_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Foreign Currency Risk We have branch operations in Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea and wholly-owned subsidiaries in Europe, Japan and China.
1094392_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our international subsidiaries and branches operate primarily using local functional currencies.

1094392_17_ITEM15_P39_S1	If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is generally based on discounted cash flows.

1094392_17_ITEM15_P48_S0	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce a deferred tax asset to that portion which more likely than not will be realized.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P49_S0	The Company does not provide for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign operations as it is the Company s intention to permanently re-invest undistributed earnings.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P49_S1	The impact of an uncertain income tax position is recognized as the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority and includes consideration of interest and penalties.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P49_S2	An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P50_S0	The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified as non-current as the Company has early adopted the new ASU No. 2015-17 Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P50_S1	For additional information on the Company s income taxes, see Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P51_S0	N. Translation of Foreign Currencies: The Company has branch operations in Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea and wholly-owned subsidiaries in the United States, Europe, Japan and China.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P51_S1	Its international subsidiaries and branches operate primarily using local functional currencies.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P51_S2	A substantial portion of the Company s international systems sales are denominated in U.S. dollars with the exception of Japan and, as a result, it has relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these sales.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P51_S3	Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and income and expense accounts and cash flow items are translated at average monthly exchange rates during the period.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P51_S4	Net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements and the effect of exchange rates on intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature are recorded directly as a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption, Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P51_S5	Any foreign currency gains or losses related to transactions are included in operating results.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P51_S6	The Company had accumulated exchange losses resulting from the translation of foreign operation financial statements of $2,742 and $2,623 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P52_S0	O. Share-based Compensation: The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires significant judgment.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P53_S1	Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from the Company s current estimates.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P54_S0	Compensation expense for all share-based payments includes an estimate for forfeitures and is recognized over the expected term of the share-based awards using the straight-line method.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P54_S1	For additional information on the Company s share-based compensation plans, see Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P55_S0	P. Research and Development and Software Development Costs: Expenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P56_S0	Certain software product development costs incurred after technological feasibility has been established are capitalized and amortized, commencing upon the general release of the software product to the Company s customers, over the economic life of the software product.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P56_S1	Annual amortization of capitalized costs is computed using the greater of: (i) the ratio of current gross revenues for the software product over the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for the software product or (ii) the straight-line basis, typically over seven years.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P56_S2	Software product development costs incurred prior to the product reaching technological feasibility are expensed as incurred and included in research and development costs.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P56_S3	At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the Company did not have any capitalized software development costs.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P57_S0	Q. Shipping and Handling Costs: Shipping and handling cost are included as a component of cost of revenues.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P57_S1	R. Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P57_S2	The estimated fair value of these obligations is based, primarily, on a market approach, comparing the Company s interest rates to those rates the Company believes it would reasonably receive upon re-entry into the market.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P57_S3	Judgment is required to estimate the fair value, using available market information and appropriate valuation methods.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P57_S4	For additional information on the Company s fair value of financial instruments, see Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P58_S0	S. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities: The Company, when it considers it to be appropriate, enters into forward contracts to hedge the economic exposures arising from foreign currency denominated transactions.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P58_S1	At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , these contracts included the future sale of Japanese Yen to purchase U.S. dollars.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P58_S2	The foreign currency forward contracts were entered into by the Company s Japanese subsidiary to hedge a portion of certain intercompany obligations.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P58_S3	The forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and therefore, the change in fair value is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P58_S4	The Company records its forward contracts at fair value in either prepaid expenses and other current assets or other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P58_S5	The dollar equivalent of the U.S. dollar forward contracts and related fair values as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:
1094392_17_ITEM15_P59_S0	In 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the Company recognized gains of $417 , $221 and $150 with respect to forward contracts that matured, respectively.

1094392_17_ITEM15_P60_S0	T. Contingencies and Litigation The Company is subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies, including certain legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P60_S1	The Company accrues for a loss contingency when it concludes that the likelihood of a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P60_S2	If the Company concludes that loss contingencies that could be material to any one of its financial statements are not probable, but are reasonably possible, or are probable, but cannot be estimated, then the Company discloses the nature of the loss contingencies, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Company expenses as incurred the costs of defending legal claims against the Company.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P61_S1	The Company does not recognize gain contingencies until realized.

1094392_17_ITEM15_P62_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 financial statement presentation.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P62_S1	These amounts include reclassification of a portion of deferred revenue to other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P63_S0	In the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires entities to present debt issuance costs related to a debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability on the balance sheet as opposed to being presented as a deferred charge.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P63_S1	Prior to adoption, the Company reported the unamortized debt issuance costs in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P63_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , the change in presentation resulted in a reduction of Other Assets of $261 and a corresponding decrease in Convertible Senior Notes with no impact on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P63_S3	These reclassifications were not considered material to the prior year financial statements.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P64_S0	V. Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.

1094392_17_ITEM15_P71_S0	Fair Value Measurements: The Company applies a three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurements.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P71_S1	This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P72_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P73_S0	substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P74_S0	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management s assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P75_S0	A financial asset s or liability s fair value measurement classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P75_S1	The following tables provide the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 :
1094392_17_ITEM15_P76_S0	The Company s investments classified as Level 1 are based on quoted market prices that are available in active markets.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P76_S1	The Company s investments classified as Level 2 are valued using observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P77_S0	The foreign currency forward contracts are primarily measured based on the foreign currency spot and forward rates quoted by the banks or foreign currency dealers.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P78_S0	Investment prices are obtained from third party pricing providers, which models prices utilizing the above observable inputs, for each asset class.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P79_S0	Level 3 investments consisted of contingent consideration related to an acquisition for which the Company uses a discounted cash flow model to value these investments.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P79_S1	The Level 3 assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for the contingent consideration included projected revenues, timing of cash flows and estimates of discount rates of 9.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1094392_17_ITEM15_P79_S2	A significant decrease in the projected revenues or increase in discount rates could result in a significantly lower fair value measurement for the contingent consideration.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P80_S0	This table presents a reconciliation for all liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the year ended December 31, 2016 :
1094392_17_ITEM15_P81_S0	See Note 4 for additional discussion regarding the fair value of the Company s marketable securities.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P82_S0	The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P82_S1	The estimated fair value of these obligations is based, primarily, on a market approach, comparing the Company s interest rates to those rates the Company believes it would reasonably receive upon re-entry into the market.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P82_S2	Judgment is required to estimate the fair value, using available market information and appropriate valuation methods.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P83_S0	The Company s convertible senior notes matured on July 15, 2016 and the principal payment amount of $60,000 was paid.

1094392_17_ITEM15_P83_S4	The Level 3 assumptions, based on data available at the valuation date used in preparing the discounted cash flow model, included estimates of interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the convertible senior notes.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P83_S5	The fair value of the contingent interest associated with the convertible senior notes was valued quarterly using the present value under an expected cash flow model incorporating the probabilities of the contingent events occurring.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P84_S0	The following table reflects information pertaining to the Company s convertible senior notes:
1094392_17_ITEM15_P85_S0	Marketable Securities: The Company has evaluated its investment policies and determined that all of its investment securities are to be classified as available-for-sale.

1094392_17_ITEM15_P87_S2	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, credit quality and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P88_S0	At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , marketable securities are categorized as follows:
1094392_17_ITEM15_P89_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable securities classified by the maturity date listed on the security, regardless of the Consolidated Balance Sheet classification, is as follows at December 31, 2016 and 2015 :
1094392_17_ITEM15_P90_S0	The following table summarizes the estimated fair value and gross unrealized holding losses of marketable securities, aggregated by investment instrument and period of time in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2016 and 2015 .

1094392_17_ITEM15_P141_S11	It is not practical to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be remitted.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P142_S0	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:

1094392_17_ITEM15_P143_S1	The year over year decrease from 2014 to 2016 is primarily due to the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits related to federal tax exposures.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P143_S2	It is reasonably possible that certain amounts of unrecognized tax benefits may reverse in the next 12 months; however, the Company does not expect such reversals would have a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P143_S3	The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

1094392_17_ITEM15_P144_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against it.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P144_S1	Although the Company believes its tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from the Company s historical income tax provisions and accruals.

1094392_17_ITEM15_P153_S2	Potential common shares that would have the effect of increasing diluted earnings per share are considered to be antidilutive.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P153_S3	In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these shares were not included in calculating diluted earnings per share.

1094392_17_ITEM15_P153_S7	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , diluted earnings per share-weighted average shares outstanding included the effect resulting from assumed conversion of the Notes and warrants.
1094392_17_ITEM15_P153_S8	For the year ended December 31, 2014 , diluted earnings per share-weighted average shares outstanding do not include any effect resulting from assumed conversion of the Notes as their impact would be anti-dilutive.

1094392_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	General Rudolph Technologies, Inc. ( Rudolph or the Company ) is a worldwide leader in the design, development, manufacture and support of process control tools that perform macro defect inspections and metrology, lithography systems, and process control analytical software used by semiconductor and advanced packaging device manufacturers.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P0_S1	Rudolph s proprietary products offer comprehensive solutions for all phases/segments of the semiconductor fabrication process.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P0_S2	Our products that provide critical yield-enhancing information, which information microelectronic device manufacturers then use to drive down costs and to decrease the time to market of their devices.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P0_S3	We provide process and yield management solutions used in both wafer processing facilities, often referred to as front-end and device packaging and test facilities, or back-end manufacturing, through a portfolio of standalone systems for macro-defect inspection, lithography, probe card test and analysis, as well as transparent and opaque thin film measurements.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P0_S4	All Rudolph systems feature sophisticated software and production-worthy automation.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P0_S5	In addition, our advanced process control software portfolio includes powerful solutions for standalone tools, groups of tools, or factory-wide suites to enhance productivity and achieve significant cost savings.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	Rudolph s systems are backed by worldwide customer service and applications support.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	Rudolph continues to drive the technological innovation of its inspection and metrology products to deliver solutions that address the demanding needs across the front-end and back-end processes of semiconductor manufacturing.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P2_S1	In 2017, Rudolph began shipments of two newly configured inspection tools the Firefly series and the Dragonfly TM series.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P2_S2	The Firefly series uses high-resolution, two-dimensional (2D) inspection technology for front-end and back-end applications and features onboard Clearfind Technology, a patented technique for enhancing the detection of defects that often escape conventional illumination techniques by revealing organic materials, thereby reducing a source of yield-robbing interconnect failures that can occur within advanced packages that utilize vertical connectivity between devices and interposers and/or redistribution layers ( RDLs ).
1094392_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Dragonfly system is a high-speed multi-dimensional tool that features Truebump TM technology to accurately measure the height of millions of micro bumps that may be deposited on a wafer in order to make electrical connections.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P3_S1	This critical dimension must be accurately controlled to assure that eventual connections are reliably created.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	These newly released products supplement Rudolph s established product portfolio of extensive process control solutions for a variety of device types, such as DRAM and 3D NAND memory, advanced packaging, RF modules, CMOS image sensors, MEMs, etc. that are used in smartphones, wearable devices, tablets and PCs, automotive, IoT and others.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	The need for more process monitoring and control continues to increase for semiconductor and related industries as the required levels of quality and reliability continue to rise.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P4_S2	Predictive analytics can lower maintenance costs, rate of scrap wafers, unscheduled tool downtime and material costs.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	Rudolph s established fault detection and classification software, which is also incorporated into tools manufactured by others companies, allows customers to seamlessly turn equipment data into actionable operational information.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P5_S1	This collaboration is designed to enhance etch and deposition tool performance.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	Industry Trends Advanced Packaging refers to a variety of technologies that enable the miniaturization of electronic products, such as portable consumer devices, including smartphones, watches, and tablets.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	In electronics manufacturing, integrated circuit packaging is the final stage of semiconductor device fabrication, in which a single circuit made from semiconducting material (a die or chip) is encased in a molded package that provides external connections to a printed circuit board and also prevents physical damage to the chip and corrosion.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	Advanced Packaging refers loosely to the conductors and other structures that often interconnect multiple die, feed them with electric power and create signal paths to and from the PC board, dissipate their heat, and protect them from damage.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P7_S2	Today, the drive to pack more functions into a small space and reduce their power requirements demands that chip packages do much more than ever before to combine multiple functions into a single molded package.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	One example of the technology used in Advanced Packaging is the 3D integration of semiconductors and other devices.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	The technology involves stacking individual die in one integrated package.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	interconnects that are embedded from the bottom surface of a die to the top surface, which allows power and communication to be shared among the individually stacke d components.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	This offers the advantages of shorter signal paths and , in turn , reduced power consumption, enhanced bandwidths, integration of heterogeneous components such as memory and logic chips, and smaller surface area.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P9_S2	The processes required for 3D i ntegration vary from one manufacturer to another and many continue to be optimized for yield and to ensure the functioning of individual stacked chips.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	Fan-out wafer level packages are another advanced packaging technology using a wide variety of 2D, 2.5D, and 3D integration techniques and are considered the next disruptive technology for several reasons.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	First, fan-out wafer level packages significantly reduces the space needed inside an electronic device, such as a smartphone, by combining multiple chips/functions into a single package, often called a system in a package ( SIP ).
1094392_18_ITEM1_P10_S2	Next, it improves the system s performance by reducing power and signal conductor lengths, which previously were routed from package to package through a PC board.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P10_S3	Using thin redistribution layers to fan out power and signal connections to the larger contacts on the PC board eliminates the need for a ceramic or laminated substrate, which accounts for 35 percent of the packaging cost.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P10_S4	Lastly, the technology is currently considered the preferred vehicle for next generation uses, such as system in package, and package on package formats.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P10_S5	As a result of the small overall form factor, fan-out wafer level packages provide the functionality needed in high-end mobile and wearable products.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	The current and projected adoption of smart mobile devices with designed-in capability to enable multiple functions in a single device continues to grow.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	In reality, there are no longer single function devices, but instead, a combined single device provides multiple functions such as phone, GPS, camera, and internet browser.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P11_S2	Aided by a myriad of available apps, the potential uses seem endless.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P11_S3	As a result, these added functions in mobile products are driving semiconductor advanced packaging and display manufacturers to implement next-generation technologies to meet these requirements.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P11_S4	These technology shifts encompass multiple high-value process steps that are creating opportunities for Rudolph solutions.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	The current process to manufacture advanced packaging involves attaching known good die to a 300mm wafer, used as a temporary carrier when adding components such as RDLs and copper pillars.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	SIP packages can often contain side-by-side die, meaning the package can be large and limit the number of packages being placed on a reconstituted wafer.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	In order to meet the growing demand at reduced average selling prices, manufacturers are looking to scalable technology.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	Advanced packaging facilities looking to improve Cost of Ownership ( CoO ) and increase productivity are transitioning from 300mm wafers to large rectangular panels, which can be as large as 600mm x 600mm.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P13_S2	This larger size enables companies manufacturing large area packages to increase the number of devices being processed at each step as they are no longer limited to operating within the constraints of a round wafer.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P13_S3	By responding to market opportunities and addressing the stringent demands of customers technical roadmaps, Rudolph is optimally positioned to capitalize on the emerging market of high volume panel manufacturing.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P13_S4	For example, the JetStep S lithography system, having emerged from the flat panel display market, is readily capable of processing RDLs on both glass and organic laminate panels in the semiconductor advanced packaging market.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P13_S5	The Firefly S Series, designed for high resolution inspection, can provide location information to the JetStep S tool for each die, which greatly improves lithography throughput.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P13_S6	It also delivers a combination of defect detection and substrate flexibility in a single platform.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P13_S7	It reduces capital investment requirements and provides a reliable pathway to transition from wafer to panel-based processes.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	Technology We believe that our expertise in engineering and our continued investment in research and development enable us to rapidly develop new technologies and products in order to quickly respond to emerging industry trends and competitive challenges.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	The breadth of our technology enables us to offer a diverse combination of process and process control solutions.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P14_S2	Unique features have been designed into our lithography systems to meet our customers changing process requirements.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P14_S3	Our metrology and inspection technologies provide process control for the majority of wafers processed today in a semiconductor wafer fab.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P14_S4	In front-end processes, thin film metrology and defect detection and classification technologies allow yield enhancement for critical processes such as photolithography, diffusion, etch, CMP and outgoing quality control.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P14_S5	Within the final manufacturing (back-end) processes, advanced macro defect inspection provides our customers with critical quality assurance and process information.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing, assembly processes (RDLs, TSVs, pillars, etc.) or general handling and can have a major impact on device and process quality.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	Lastly, we turn all of the data gathered into useful knowledge for our customers to make yield-enhancing decisions, which lower their cost of goods ( COGS ) and improve their margins.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	Process Control Business Macro Defect Inspection.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	Chip manufacturers deploy advanced macro defect inspection throughout the production line to monitor key process steps, gather process-enhancing information and ultimately, lower manufacturing costs.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P16_S2	Field-established tools such as the F30 and NSX inspection systems are found in the wafer fab (front-end) and packaging (back-end) facilities around the world.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P16_S3	These high-speed tools incorporate features such as wafer-less recipe creation, tool-to-tool correlation and multiple inspection resolutions.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P16_S4	In addition to wafer frontside inspection, Rudolph s innovative Explorer Platform allows wafer edge and backside inspection in one integrated platform to enhance productivity and continuously improve fab yield.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Using Discover yield management software, the vast amounts of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed and classified to determine trends and locate root causes that directly affect yield.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	All-surface refers to inspection of the wafer frontside, edge, and backside as well as back-end die.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	The edge inspection process focuses on the area near the wafer edge, an area that poses difficulty for traditional wafer frontside inspection technology due to its varied topography and process variation.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	Edge bevel inspection looks for defects on the side edge of a wafer.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	Edge bead removal and edge exclusion metrology involve a topside surface measurement required exclusively in the photolithography process, primarily to determine if wafers have been properly aligned for the edge exclusion region.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	The primary reason for wafer backside inspection is to determine if contamination has been created that may spread throughout the wafer fab.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	For instance, it is critical that the wafer backside be free of defects prior to the photolithography process to prevent focus and exposure problems on the wafer frontside.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	Residue is difficult or impossible to see with conventional bright field or dark field imaging techniques using white light.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	Residue contaminants, such as residual photo resist, are often the root cause of field failures, which occur after the material has been exposed to normal operating conditions for extended periods.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P22_S2	Rudolph s new Clearfind technology highlights residue on bumps and bond pads or RDL vias so that they are easy to detect.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P22_S3	On metals, it eliminates the high-contrast graininess seen under conventional illumination, resulting in an obvious defect signal against a featureless background.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P22_S4	This same graininess in conventional imaging can also cause false positives, which are especially costly at this stage of the process where secondary inspections must be initiated to verify real defects and allow the false defects to continue through packaging.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P22_S5	Finally, Clearfind technology readily detects shorts and opens in metal lines when inspected with an underlying organic layer.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	Automated Defect Classification and Pattern Analysis.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	Automating the defect detection and classification process is best done by a system that can mimic, or even extend, the response of the human eye, but at a much higher speed, with higher resolution and more consistency.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P23_S2	To do this, our systems capture full-color whole wafer images using simultaneous dark and bright field illumination.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P23_S3	The resulting bright and dark field images are compared to those from an ideal wafer having no defects.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P23_S4	When a difference is detected, its image is broken down into mathematical vectors that allow rapid and accurate comparison with a library of known classified defects stored in the tool s database.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	this approach enable very fast and highly repeatable image classification.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	The system is pre-programmed with an extensive library of local, gl obal, and color defects and can also store a virtually unlimited amount of new defect classes.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	This allows customers to define defects based on their existing defect classification system, provides more reliable automated rework decisions and enables more accurate statistical process control data.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P24_S3	Reviewing defects off-line enables automated inspection systems to maintain their utilization for high throughput inspection.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	Using defect image files captured by automated inspection systems, operators are able t o view high-resolution defect images to determine defects that cause catastrophic failure of a device, known as killer defects.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	Combining the review process with classifying defects enables faster analysis by grouping defects found together as one larger d efect, a scratch for example, and defects of similar types across a wafer lot to be grouped based on size, repeating defects, and other user-defined specifications.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	Using wafer maps, charts and graphs, the massive amounts of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed to determine trends across bumps, die, wafers and lots.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	This analysis may determine where a process variation or deviation has occurred, allowing process engineers to make corrections or enhancements to increase yields.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	Defect data analysis is performed to identify, analyze and locate the source of defects and other manufacturing process excursions.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P27_S1	Using either a single wafer map or a composite map created from multiple wafer maps, this analysis enables identification of defect patterns and distribution.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P27_S2	When combined with inspection data from strategically-placed inspection points, this analysis may pinpoint the source of the defects so corrective action can be taken.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	Optical acoustic metrology involves the use of ultra-fast laser induced sonar for metal and opaque thin film measurement.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	This technology sends ultrasonic waves into multi-layer opaque films and then analyzes the resulting reflected acoustic waves (echoes) to simultaneously determine the thickness of each individual layer in complex multi-layer metal film stacks.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P28_S2	The reflected signal s amplitude and phase can be used to detect film properties, missing layers and interlayer problems.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P28_S3	Since different phenomena affect amplitude and phase uniquely, a variety of process critical interlayer problems can be detected in a single measurement.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	The use of optical acoustics to measure multi-layer metal and opaque films was pioneered by scientists at Brown University ( Brown ) in collaboration with engineers at Rudolph.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	The proprietary optical acoustic technology in our PULSE Technology systems measures the thickness of single or multi-layer opaque films, with a huge range of less than 40 Angstroms to greater than five microns.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P29_S2	It provides these measurements at a rate of up to 70 wafers per hour within one to two percent accuracy and typically greater than 99 percent repeatability.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P29_S3	This range of thicknesses covers the majority of thick and thin metal films projected by the International Roadmap for Semiconductors to be used through the end of this decade.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our non-contact, non-destructive optical acoustic technology and small spot size enable our PULSE Technology systems to measure film properties directly on product wafers.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	The Meta PULSE System allows customers to simultaneously measure the thickness and other properties of up to six metal or non-metallic opaque film layers without physically contacting product wafers in a non-destructive manner.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	PULSE Technology uses an ultra-fast laser to generate acoustic waves that pass down through a stack of opaque films such as those used in copper or aluminum interconnect processes, sending back to the surface a reflected signal (echo) that indicates film thickness, density, and other process critical parameters.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	We believe we are a leader in providing systems that can measure opaque thin-film stacks non-destructively with the speed and accuracy semiconductor device manufacturers demand in order to achieve high yields with the latest fabrication processes.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P31_S2	The technology is ideal for characterizing copper interconnect structures.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P31_S3	The Meta PULSE System, used initially for fast and accurate measurements of metal interconnect in front-end wafer fabs, has now been chosen by back-end manufacturers to perform system measurements in new process applications such as RF filters and modules, driven by the need for on-product metrology as feature sizes decrease and pattern densities increase.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	Ellipsometry is a non-contact, non-destructive optical technique for transparent thin film measurement.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	We have been an industry leader in ellipsometry technology for the last three decades.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P32_S2	We hold patents on several ellipsometry technologies, including our proprietary technique that uses four lasers for multiple-angle of incidence, multiple wavelength ellipsometry.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P32_S3	Laser ellipsometry technology enables our transparent film systems to provide the increasingly higher level of accuracy needed as thinner films and newer materials are introduced for future generations of semiconductor devices.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	extended this same optical technology to characterize the scatterometry signal from patterned surfaces, allowing measurement of critical dimensions.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	For applications requiring broader spectral coverage, some of our ellipsometry tools are also equipped with a reflectometer.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	Reflectometry uses a white or ultraviolet light source to determine the properties of transparent thin films by analyzing the wavelength and intensity of light reflected from the surface of a wafer.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	This optical information is processed with software algorithms to determine film thickness and other material properties.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P34_S2	By combining data from both the laser ellipsometer and broad spectrum reflectometer, it is possible to characterize films and film stacks that cannot be adequately analyzed by either method individually.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	Rudolph s patented transparent film technology uses up to four lasers operating simultaneously at multiple angles and multiple wavelengths, providing powerful analysis and measurement capabilities.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	Unlike the white-light sources used in spectroscopic ellipsometers, laser light sources make our metrology tools inherently stable, increase measurement speed and accuracy, and reduce maintenance costs by minimizing the time required to re-qualify a light source when it is replaced.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	Rudolph s S3000SX System is targeted for transparent films in advanced semiconductor fabrication applications at the 28nm node and below.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	The S3000 product family uses Rudolph s proprietary Focused Beam Ellipsometry ( FBE ) and newly-designed Small Site Measurement Optics ( SSMO ) to measure the thickness of single layer and multi-layer films on product wafers, including device area at site sizes as small as 30x30 nanometers.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	The combination of fast 3D-OCM (optical comparative metrology) technology with improved testing accuracy and repeatability is designed to reduce total test time for even the most advanced large area probe cards.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P37_S2	The 3D capabilities enable users to analyze probe marks and probe tips in a rapid and information-rich format.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	Lithography Business Step and Repeat Technology.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	Rudolph steppers use projection optics to expose circuit patterns from a mask or reticle onto a substrate to expose images with optimal fidelity.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	These systems employ light from a mercury arc lamp that is transmitted through a mask or reticle containing display circuit patterns.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	Substrates are aligned on the system and the mask is imaged through a projection lens onto photoresist material coated on the substrate.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P40_S2	The substrate is then moved, or stepped, to a second position to expose an adjacent area.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P40_S3	Images can be stitched together precisely to form larger circuit patterns without any noticeable change in circuit performance.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P40_S4	The system repeats the step and exposure process until the entire substrate is patterned.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P40_S5	Once the exposure process has been completed, the substrate is developed with an alkali solution to reveal the underlying material.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P40_S6	The imaged photoresist serves as a stencil barrier that allows for the processing of the underlying metal or insulating layers.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P40_S7	The substrates then continue through the etching, stripping and deposition processes until multi-layer circuits are completed.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	In order to deal with increased input/output ( I/O ) resulting from devices with enhanced functionality, power distribution efficiency, and higher frequency, integrated device manufacturers ( IDMs ) and outsourced semiconductor assembly and test ( OSATs ) facilities must incorporate lithography capabilities to create RDLs for their advanced packaging technologies.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	However, the associated substrates and processes are significantly different than those used in front-end wafer processing.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	For advanced packaging, the lithography system must perform in a completely different application, with significantly different operating parameters.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	For example, most packaging is an additive process, while wafer processing is subtractive, and thick films, rather than thin films, are used to enable the creation of features.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P42_S2	In order for equipment to effectively function in this environment, it must overcome these challenges.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P42_S3	Rudolph s JetStep Systems have been specifically designed to meet these challenges head on.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P42_S4	The JetStep W Series is designed for wafers and other round substrates while the JetStep S Series is designed for rectangular substrates (panels).
1094392_18_ITEM1_P42_S5	Both systems boast a large printable field, which when combined with user-selectable wavelength options, maximizes throughput while not limiting resolution when needed.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P42_S6	High-fidelity optics are able to image the fine features required while at the same time achieving superior depth of field to minimize non-flatness that is typical for advanced packaging applications.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P42_S7	On-the-fly auto focus and an innovative reticle management system improve yield and utilization.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P42_S8	These features result in a revolutionary lithography system specifically designed to meet advanced packaging challenges.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	Flat Panel Display ( FPD ) Lithography .
1094392_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	A critical aspect of any leading mobile device is the display.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	The display serves as the window to the user.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P44_S2	Therefore, it must effectively present graphics from a variety of apps, such as detailed maps, high resolut ion photos, and streaming video in order to provide an enhanced user experience.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P44_S3	To accomplish this, the display s transistor backplane, which is what controls the individual pixels, must operate at a high frequency and not limit the pixel resolution.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P44_S4	As a result, the transistors must have high mobility and only use a small portion of the pixel aperture.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	The backplane is manufactured on a sheet of glass; like the packaging substrate, it is non-flat and tends to distort further during processing.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	Additional ly, the displays are getting larger.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P45_S2	Manufacturers are looking to utilize larger glass substrates, making throughput a challenge for the lithography equipment.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P45_S3	To overcome this, Rudolph s JetStep G Series uses high-fidelity optics and the largest printabl e stepper field available , enabling more displays per exposure.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P45_S4	This feature, combined with on-the-fly auto-focus and magnification compensation, maximizes throughput and yield.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P45_S5	Finally, our patented grid stage allows the system to be easily configurable to meet the customer desired substrate size.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	Integrated Software Solutions Process Control Software .
1094392_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	We provide a wide range of advanced process control solutions, all designed to improve factory profitability, including run-to-run control, fault detection, classification and tool automation.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	Rudolph is a leading provider of Process Control Software in the semiconductor industry.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	Advanced process control ( APC ) employs software to automatically detect or predict tool failure (fault detection) as well as calculate recipe settings for a process that will drive the yielded output to meet and exceed the target, despite variations in the incoming material and minor instabilities within the process equipment.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P47_S2	Process control software enables the factory to increase capacity and yield while decreasing rework and scrap.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P47_S3	It enables reduced production costs by lowering consumables, process engineering time and manufacturing cycle time.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	Semiconductor manufacturers use yield management software ( YMS ) to obtain valuable process yield and equipment productivity information.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	The data necessary to generate productivity information comes from many different sources throughout the wafer fab: inspection and metrology systems, tool sensors, tool recipes, electrical tests and the fab environment.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	As the complexity and cost of manufacturing processes increase, the value of faster, better analysis to support critical manufacturing decisions grows.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	As a result, customers are demanding robust yield management systems that can analyze large, complex data sets quickly and effectively.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	Rudolph s fully-integrated YMS are designed to analyze data from disparate sources and multiple sites to maximize productivity across the entire value chain.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	Products Rudolph markets and sells products to major analog, logic, memory, RF, CMOS Image Sensors, MEMs, and flat panel display manufacturers.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	These customers are IDMs, OSAT manufacturers, and foundries that are producing wafers and packages for fabless design companies.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P51_S2	Our customers rely on us for versatile inspection, lithography and metrology systems as well as process control software solutions.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P51_S3	These products are designed for high-volume production facilities and offer automated wafer handling for 200mm and 300mm configurations and panel handling up to 720 x 930mm.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P51_S4	Our systems operate at high throughput in an ultra-clean operating mode with high reliability.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	Customers Over 100 microelectronic device manufacturers have purchased Rudolph tools and software for installation at multiple sites.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	We support a diverse customer base in terms of both geographic location and type of device manufactured.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P52_S2	Our customers are located in 20 countries.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P52_S3	See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information concerning our geographic information.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	We depend on a relatively small number of customers and end users for a large percentage of our revenues.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	In the years 2017, 2016 and 2015, aggregate sales to end user customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for 27.2%, 34.5% and 23.3% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P53_S2	No individual end user customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P53_S3	We do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	Research and Development The markets for equipment and systems for manufacturing semiconductor devices and for performing macro-defect inspection, advanced packaging lithography and thin film transparent and opaque process control metrology are characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P54_S1	We believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products is critical to our success.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P54_S2	Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our technical, management and financial resources to research and development programs.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P54_S3	As of December 31, 2017, we employed 187 engineering personnel.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P54_S4	Our research and development expenditures in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $47.0 million, $45.0 million and $41.2 million, respectively.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P54_S5	We expect to continue our strong commitment to new product development and will continue to allocate significant resources to these efforts in the future.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	Sales, Customer Service and Application Support We maintain an extensive network of direct sales, customer service and application support offices in the United States, Europe and Asia.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P55_S1	We provide our customers with comprehensive support before, during and after the delivery of our products.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P55_S2	For example, in order to facilitate the smooth integration of our tools into our customers operations, we often assign dedicated, site-specific field service and applications engineers to provide long-term support at selected customer sites.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P55_S3	We also provide comprehensive service and applications training for customers at our training facilities in Bloomington, Minnesota and Budd Lake, New Jersey and at customer locations.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P55_S4	In addition, we maintain a group of highly skilled applications scientists at strategically located facilities throughout the world and at selected customer locations.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P55_S5	As of December 31, 2017, we employed 258 sales and marketing, service and applications support personnel.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	Manufacturing Our principal manufacturing activities include assembly, final test and calibration.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P56_S1	These activities are conducted in our manufacturing facilities in Bloomington, Minnesota and Wilmington, Massachusetts.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P56_S2	Our core manufacturing competencies include electrical, optical and mechanical assembly and testing, as well as the management of new product transitions.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P56_S3	While we use standard components and subassemblies wherever possible, most mechanical parts, metal fabrications and critical components used in our products are engineered and manufactured to our specifications.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P56_S4	We continue to rely on subcontractors and turnkey suppliers to fabricate components, build assemblies and perform other non-core activities in a cost-effective manner.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P56_S5	As of December 31, 2017, we employed 82 manufacturing personnel.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	We rely on a number of limited source suppliers for certain parts and subassemblies.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	This reliance creates a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components, and reduced control over pricing and time of delivery of components.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P57_S2	An inability to obtain adequate supplies would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or might require us to redesign our systems to accommodate different components or subassemblies.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P57_S3	To date, we have not experienced any significant delivery delays.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P57_S4	However, if we were forced to seek alternative sources of supply, manufacture such components or subassemblies internally, or redesign our products, this could prevent us from shipping our products to our customers on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	We have a policy of seeking patents on inventions governing new products or technologies as part of our ongoing research, development, and manufacturing activities.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	As of December 31, 2017, we have been granted, or hold exclusive licenses to, 262 U.S. and foreign patents.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P58_S2	The patents we own, jointly own or exclusively license have expiration dates ranging from 2018 to 2035.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P58_S3	We also have 72 pending regular and provisional applications in the U.S. and other countries.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P58_S4	Our patents and applications principally cover various aspects of macro-defect detection and classification, transparent thin film measurement, altered material characterization, lithography techniques and automation.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P58_S5	We have been granted patent licenses by organizations such as Brown University Research Foundation and the University of Colorado.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P58_S6	These licenses are subject to rights retained by these organizations and, where applicable the United States government, for their own non-commercial uses.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P58_S7	These patents relate to opto-acoustic metrology technology that underlies our opaque film products such as the MetaPULSE product family.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P58_S8	The terms of these licenses are equal to the lives of the patents.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P58_S9	We pay royalties to Brown and the University of Colorado based upon a percentage of our revenues from the sale of systems that incorporate the licensed technology.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P58_S10	We continue to work with Brown and the University of Colorado on the development of advancements in relevant technical areas.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P58_S11	We also continue to pursue intellectual property protection, including exclusive licenses to this technology.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P58_S12	Note that third party licensees may terminate a license if we fail to pay royalties or if we materially breach our license agreements with those third parties.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P58_S13	Our pending patents may never be issued, and even if they are, these patents, our existing patents and the patents we license may not provide sufficiently broad protection to protect our proprietary rights, or they may prove to be unenforceable.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P58_S14	To protect our proprietary rights, we also rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions and licenses.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P58_S15	There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same degree as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial infringement problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in such countries, some of which are countries in which we have sold and continue to sell products.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	There is a risk that our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P59_S2	For example, our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P59_S3	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	Competition The market for semiconductor capital equipment is highly competitive.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P60_S1	We face substantial competition from established companies in each of the markets that we serve.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P60_S2	We principally compete with KLA-Tencor, Camtek and Veeco Instruments.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P60_S3	We compete to a lesser extent with companies such as Nanometrics, Nova Measuring Instruments and Nikon.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P60_S4	Each of our products also competes with products that use different metrology and inspection techniques.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P60_S5	Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, broader product offerings and service capabilities and larger installed customer bases than we do.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	Significant competitive factors in the market for inspection and metrology systems include system performance, ease of use, reliability, cost of ownership, technical support and customer relationships.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P61_S1	We believe that, while price and delivery are important competitive factors, the customers overriding requirement is for a product that meets their technical capabilities.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P61_S2	To remain competitive, we believe we will need to maintain a high level of investment in research and development and process applications.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P61_S3	No assurances can be given that we will continue to be competitive in the future.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	Backlog We schedule production of our systems based upon order backlog and informal customer forecasts.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P62_S1	We use the term backlog to refer to only those orders to which the customer has assigned a purchase order number and for which delivery is anticipated within 12 months.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P62_S2	Because shipment dates may be changed and customers may cancel or delay orders with little or no penalty, our backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P62_S3	At December 31, 2017, we had a backlog of approximately $87.8 million compared with a backlog of approximately $41.6 million at December 31, 2016.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P62_S4	Employees As of December 31, 2017, we had 592 employees.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P62_S5	Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements, and we have never experienced a work stoppage.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P62_S6	We believe our employee relations are good.
1094392_18_ITEM1_P62_S7	We were incorporated in Delaware in 1999.

1094392_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Risks Related to Rudolph Our operating results have varied, and will likely continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, causing volatility in our stock price.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and will likely continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, causing volatility in our stock price.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Some of the factors that may influence our operating results and subject our stock to extreme price and volume fluctuations include:
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	the levels of our fixed expenses, including research and development costs associated with product development, relative to our revenue levels.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	In light of these factors and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Moreover, many of our expenses are fixed in the short-term which, together with the need for continued investment in research and development, marketing and customer support, limits our ability to reduce expenses quickly.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	As a result, declines in net sales could harm our business and the price of our common stock could substantially decline.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Our largest customers account for a substantial portion of our revenues, and our revenues and cash flows could decline considerably if one or more of these customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems or they delay or cancel a large order.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Sales to end user customers that individually represent at least five percent of our revenues typically account for, in the aggregate, a considerable amount of our revenues.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We operate in the highly concentrated, capital-intensive semiconductor device manufacturing industry.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Historically, a substantial portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers, and this trend is expected to continue.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	If any of our key customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems in the future, or if they delay or cancel a large order, our revenues and cash flows could meaningfully decline.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	We expect that we will continue to depend on a small number of large customers for a sizable portion of our revenues.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P3_S4	In addition, as large semiconductor device manufacturers seek to establish closer relationships with their suppliers, we expect that our customer base will become even more concentrated.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Our customers may be unable to pay us for our products and services.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Our customers include some companies that may, from time to time, encounter financial difficulties.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P3_S7	If a customer s financial difficulties become severe, the customer may be unwilling or unable to pay our invoices in the ordinary course of business, which could adversely affect collections of both our accounts receivable balance and unbilled services.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P3_S8	The bankruptcy of a customer with a substantial account balance owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P3_S9	In addition, if a customer declares bankruptcy after paying us certain invoices, a court may determine that we are not properly entitled to that payment and may require repayment of some or all of the amount we received, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell ou r systems may cause fluctuations in our operating results, which could cause our stock price to decline .
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Variations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our revenues and cash flows, and consequently, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, to fluctuate widely from period to period.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	This variation could cause our stock price to decline.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Our customers generally take a long time to evaluate our inspection and/or film metrology systems and many people are involved in the evaluation process.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We expend significant resources educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our systems in the semiconductor fabrication process.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P4_S5	The length of time it takes for us to make a sale depends upon many factors, including, but not limited to:
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	the quality and sophistication of the customer s current metrology, inspection or lithography equipment.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Because of the number of factors influencing the sales process, the period between our initial contact with a customer and the time when we recognize revenue from that customer and receive payment, if ever, varies widely in length.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our sales cycles, including the time it takes for us to build a product to customer specifications after receiving an order to the time we recognize revenue, typically range from six to twenty-four months.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Sometimes our sales cycles can be much longer, particularly with customers in Japan.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	During these cycles, we commit substantial resources to our sales efforts in advance of receiving any revenue, and we may never receive any revenue from a customer despite our sales efforts.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	If we do make a sale, our customers often purchase only one of our systems, the performance of which they then evaluate for a lengthy period before purchasing any more of our systems.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P6_S5	The number of additional products a customer purchases, if any, depends on many factors, including the customer s capacity requirements.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P6_S6	The period between a customer s initial purchase and any subsequent purchases can vary from six months to a year or longer, and variations in the length of this period could cause further fluctuations in our operating results and, possibly, in our stock price.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Most of our revenues have been derived from customers outside of the United States, subjecting us to operational, financial and political risks, such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs, political and economic instability, outbreaks of hostilities, and difficulties in managing foreign sales representatives and foreign branch operations, as well as risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Due to the significant level of our international sales, we are subject to a number of material risks, including: Compliance with foreign laws.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P6_S9	Our business is subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally, including compliance with, inconsistencies among, and unexpected changes in, a wide variety of foreign laws and regulatory environments with which we are not familiar, including, among other issues, with respect to employees, protection of our intellectual property, and a wide variety of operational regulations and trade and export controls under domestic, foreign, and international law.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P6_S10	Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including tariffs and other market barriers.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The semiconductor device industry is a high-visibility industry in many of the European and Asian countries in which we sell our products.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Because the governments of these countries have provided extensive financial support to our semiconductor device manufacturing customers in these countries, we believe that our customers could be disproportionately affected by any trade embargoes, excise taxes or other restrictions imposed by their governments on trade with United States companies such as ourselves.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Any restrictions of these types could result in a reduction in our sales to customers in these countries.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We are subject to various global risks related to political and economic instabilities in countri es in which we derive sales.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If terrorist activities, armed conflict, civil or military unrest or political instability occurs outside of the U.S., these events may result in reduced demand for our products.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	There is considerable political instability in T aiwan related to its disputes with China and in South Korea related to its disputes with North Korea.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In addition, several Asian countries, particularly Japan, have experienced significant economic instability.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	An outbreak of hostilities or other political upheaval in China, Taiwan or South Korea, or an economic downturn in Japan or other countries, would likely harm the operations of our customers in these countries.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The effect of these types of events on our revenues and cash flows could be material becau se we derive substantial revenues from sales to semiconductor device foundries in Taiwan such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd., from memory chip manufacturers in South Korea such as Samsung, and from semiconductor device manufacturers in Japan such as Toshiba.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign branch operations.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	During periods of tension between the governments of the United States and certain other countries, it is often difficult for United States companies such as ourselves to staff and manage operations in such countries.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Language and other cultural differences may also inhibit our sales and marketing efforts and create internal communication problems among our U.S. and foreign research and development teams, increasing the difficulty of managing multiple remote locations performing various development, quality assurance, and yield ramp analysis projects.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Currency fluctuations as compared to the U.S. Dollar.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	A substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	As a result, if the dollar rises in value in relation to foreign currencies, our systems will become more expensive to customers outside the United States and less competitive with systems produced by competitors outside the United States.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	These conditions could negatively impact our international sales.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Foreign sales also expose us to collection risk in the event it becomes more expensive for our foreign customers to convert their local currencies into U.S. dollars.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Additionally, in the event a larger portion of our revenue becomes denominated in foreign currencies, we would be subject to a potentially significant exchange rate risk.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P11_S6	If we deliver systems with defects, our credibility will be harmed and the sales and market acceptance of our systems will decrease.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Our systems are complex and have occasionally contained errors, defects and bugs when introduced.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing or general handling, and can have a major impact on device and process quality.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P11_S9	When this occurs, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our systems could be harmed.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P11_S10	Further, if our systems contain errors, defects or bugs, computer viruses or malicious code as a result of cyber attacks to our computer networks, we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate these problems.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Defects could also lead to product liability as a result of product liability lawsuits against us or against our customers.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We have agreed to indemnify our customers under certain circumstances against liability arising from defects in our systems.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our product liability insurance policy currently provides $2.0 million of aggregate coverage, with an overall umbrella limit of $20.0 million.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In the event of a successful product liability claim, we could be obligated to pay damages significantly in excess of our product liability insurance limits.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If we are not successful in developing new and enhanced products for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry, we will lose sales and market share to our competitors.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We operate in an industry that is highly competitive and subject to evolving industry standards, rapid technological changes, rapid changes in consumer demands and the rapid introduction of new, higher performance systems with shorter product life cycles.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	To be competitive in our demanding market, we must continually design, develop and introduce in a timely manner new lithography, inspection and metrology process control systems that meet the performance and price demands of semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We must also continue to refine our current systems so that they remain competitive.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We expect to continue to make significant investments in our research and development activities.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P14_S5	We may experience difficulties or delays in our development efforts with respect to new systems, and we may not ultimately be successful in our product enhancement efforts to improve and advance products or in responding effectively to technological change, as not all research and development activities result in viable commercial products.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P14_S6	In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to develop new products for the most opportunistic new markets and applications.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P14_S7	Any significant delay in releasing new systems could cause our products to become obsolete, adversely affect our reputation, give a competitor a first-to-market advantage or cause a competitor to achieve greater market share.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P14_S8	If new products developed by us do not gain general market acceptance, we will be unable to generate revenues and recover our research and development costs.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Further, our products are complex and often the applications to our customers businesses are unique.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Any new systems we introduce may not achieve or sustain a significant degree of market acceptance and sales.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources developing new systems and refining our existing systems.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	In light of the long product development cycles inherent in our industry, these expenditures will be made well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenue from the sale of those systems.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market new systems are subject to a wide variety of challenges during the development cycle, including start-up bugs, design defects, and other matters that could delay introduction of these systems.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S5	In addition, since our customers are not obligated by long-term contracts to purchase our systems, our anticipated product orders may not materialize, or orders that are placed may be canceled.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S6	As a result, if we do not achieve market acceptance of new products, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows to recover our research and development costs and our market share, revenue, operating results or stock price would be negatively impacted.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Even if we are able to develop new products that gain market acceptance, sales of these new products could impair our ability to sell existing products.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Competition from our new systems could have a negative effect on sales of our existing systems and the prices that we could charge for these systems.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S9	We may also divert sales and marketing resources from our current systems in order to successfully launch and promote our new or next generation systems.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S10	This diversion of resources could have a further negative effect on sales of our current systems and the value of inventory.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S11	If our relationships with our large customers deteriorate, our product development activities could be adversely affected.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S12	The success of our product development efforts depends on our ability to anticipate market trends and the price, performance and functionality requirements of semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S13	In order to anticipate these trends and ensure that critical development projects proceed in a coordinated manner, we must continue to collaborate closely with our largest customers.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S14	Our relationships with these and other customers provide us with access to valuable information regarding trends in the semiconductor device industry, which enables us to better plan our product development activities.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S15	If our current relationships with our large customers are impaired, or if we are unable to develop similar collaborative relationships with important customers in the future, our product development activities could be adversely affected.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S16	Our ability to reduce costs is limited by our ongoing need to invest in research and development and to provide customer support activities.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S17	Our industry is characterized by the need for continual investment in research and development as well as customer service and support.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S18	As a result, our operating results could be materially affected if operating costs associated with our research and development as well as customer support activities increase in the future or we are unable to reduce those activities.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S19	We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property and, therefore, lose our competitive advantage.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S20	Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology for our principal product families, and we rely, in part, on patent and trade secret law and confidentiality agreements to protect that technology.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S21	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it will give our competitors a significant advantage.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S22	We own or have licensed a number of patents relating to our transparent and opaque thin film metrology, lithography and macro-defect inspection systems, and have filed applications for additional patents.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S23	Any of our pending patent applications may be rejected, and we may be unable to develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable in the future.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S24	In addition, the patents that we do own or that have been issued or licensed to us may not provide us with competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S25	Further, third parties may also design around these patents.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In addition to patent protection, we rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and technology.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and other third parties.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Even though these agreements are in place, there can be no assurances that trade secrets and proprietary information will not be disclosed, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, or that we can fully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Violations by others of our confidentiality agreements and the loss of employees who have specialized knowledge and expertise could harm our competitive position and cause our sales and operating results to decline as a result of increased competition.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection might adversely affect our ability to continue our research or bring products to market.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Protection of our intellectual property rights, or the efforts of third parties to enforce their own intellectual property rights against us, may result in costly and time-consuming litigation, substantial damages, lost product sales and/or the loss of important intellectual property rights.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We may be required to initiate litigation in order to enforce any patents issued to or licensed by us or to determine the scope or validity of a third party s patent or other proprietary rights.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Any litigation, regardless of outcome, could be expensive and time consuming and could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to re-engineer our products or obtain expensive licenses from third parties.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P17_S5	In addition, our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P17_S6	From time to time, we may receive communications from third parties asserting that our products or systems infringe, or may infringe, on the proprietary rights of these third parties.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P17_S7	These claims of infringement may lead to protracted and costly litigation, which could require us to pay substantial damages or have the sale of our products or systems stopped by an injunction.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Infringement claims could also cause product or system delays or require us to redesign our products or systems, and these delays could result in the loss of substantial revenues.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P17_S9	We may also be required to obtain a license from the third party or cease activities utilizing the third party s proprietary rights.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P17_S10	We may not be able to enter into such a license or such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P17_S11	Accordingly, the loss of important intellectual property rights could hinder our ability to sell our systems or to make the sale of these systems more expensive.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P17_S12	For additional information regarding recent patent litigation, see Item 3 ( Legal Proceedings ).
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in certain foreign countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the United States.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement abroad.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	For example, Taiwan is not a signatory of the Patent Cooperation Treaty, which is designed to specify rules and methods for defending intellectual property internationally.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	The publication of a patent in Taiwan prior to the filing of a patent in Taiwan would invalidate the ability of a company to obtain a patent in Taiwan.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Similarly, in contrast to the United States where the contents of patents remain confidential during the patent application process, in Taiwan the contents of a patent are published upon filing which provides competitors an advance view of the contents of a patent application prior to the establishment of patent rights.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Consequently, there is a risk that we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights in certain foreign countries.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P18_S6	If this occurs, it would be easier for our competitors to develop and sell competing products in these countries.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Some of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, and increased competition could impair sales of our products or cause us to reduce our prices.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The market for semiconductor capital equipment is highly competitive.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We face substantial competition from established companies in each of the markets we serve.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We principally compete with KLA-Tencor, Camtek and Veeco Instruments.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	We compete to a lesser extent with companies such as Nanometrics, Nova Measuring Instruments and Nikon.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Each of our products also competes with products that use different metrology, inspection or lithography techniques.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, broader product offerings and service capabilities and larger installed customer bases than we do.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P19_S6	As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or market developments by devoting greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products, which, in turn, could impair sales of our products.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Further, there may be significant merger and acquisition activity among our competitors and potential competitors, which, in turn, may provide them with a competitive advantage over us by enabling them to rapidly expand their product offerings and service capabilities to meet a broader range of customer needs.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Many of our customers and potential customers in the semiconductor device manufacturing industry are large companies that require global support and service for their semiconductor capital equipment.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We believe that our global support and service infrastructure is sufficient to meet the needs of our customers and potential customers.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	However, some of our competitors have more extensive infrastructures than we do, which could place us at a disadvantage when competing for the business of global semiconductor device manufacturers.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Many of our competitors are investing heavily in the development of new systems that will compete directly with our systems.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	our market share, and competitive pres sures may necessitate further price reductions.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We expect our competitors in each product area to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices and performance characteristics.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	These product introductions would likely require us to decrease the prices of our systems and increase the level of discounts that we grant our customers.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Price reductions or lost sales as a result of these competitive pressures would reduce our total revenues a nd could adversely impact our financial results.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Because of the high cost of switching equipment vendors in our markets, it is sometimes difficult for us to win customers from our competitors even if our systems are superior to theirs.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We believe that once a semiconductor device manufacturer has selected one vendor s capital equipment for a production-line application, the manufacturer generally relies upon that capital equipment and, to the extent possible, subsequent generations of the same vendor s equipment, for the life of the application.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Once a vendor s equipment has been installed in a production line application, a semiconductor device manufacturer must often make substantial technical modifications and may experience production-line downtime in order to switch to another vendor s equipment.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Accordingly, unless our systems offer performance or cost advantages that outweigh a customer s expense of switching to our systems, it will be difficult for us to achieve significant sales to that manufacturer once it has selected another vendor s capital equipment for an application.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	We must attract and retain experienced senior executives and other key personnel with knowledge of semiconductor device manufacturing and inspection, metrology or lithography equipment to help support our future growth, and competition for such personnel in our industry is high.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key executive management, engineering, sales and marketing, customer support, finance and manufacturing personnel.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P23_S5	The loss of any of these key personnel through resignations, retirement or other circumstances, each of whom would be extremely difficult to replace, could harm our business and operating results.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Although we have employment and noncompetition agreements with key members of our senior management team, these individuals or other key employees may still leave us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P23_S7	We do not have key person life insurance on any of our executives.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P23_S8	In addition, to support our future growth, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P23_S9	Competition for such personnel in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified employees.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P23_S10	We obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a limited group of suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenues.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a limited group of suppliers and do not have long-term contracts with many of our suppliers.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our dependence on limited source suppliers of components and our lack of long-term contracts with many of our suppliers exposes us to several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components, price increases, late deliveries and poor component quality.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our systems, damage our customer relationships and reduce our sales.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	From time to time in the past, we have experienced temporary difficulties in receiving shipments from our suppliers.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The lead-time required for shipments of some of our components can be as long as six months.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In addition, the lead time required to qualify new suppliers for lasers and certain optics could be as long as a year, and the lead time required to qualify new suppliers of other components could be as long as nine months.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	If we are unable to accurately predict our component needs, or if our component supply is disrupted, we may miss market opportunities by not being able to meet the demand for our systems.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Further, a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components or subassemblies could seriously harm our results of operations and cash flows.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility could have a material adverse effect on our revenues.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Our manufacturing processes are highly complex and require sophisticated and costly equipment and a specially designed facility.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P26_S4	As a result, any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, or destruction of or damage as a result of a fire or any other reason, could seriously harm our ability to satisfy our customer order deadlines.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P26_S5	If we cannot timely deliver our systems, our results from operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks .
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Information technology systems are increasingly threatened by cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Cybersecurity attacks could include, but are not limited to, malicious software, viruses, attempts to gain unauthorized access, whether through malfeasance or error, either from within or outside of our organization, to our data or that of our customers or our customers customers which may be in our possession, and the unauthorized release, corruption or loss of the data, loss of the intellectual property, theft of the proprietary or licensed technology, whether ours, that of our customers or their customers, loss or damage to our data delivery systems, other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in our critical systems, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	It is possible that our business, financial and other systems could be compromised, which might not be noticed for some period of time.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks are evolving and unpredictable and we cannot guarantee that any risk prevention measures implemented will be successful.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S4	The occurrence of such an attack could lead to financial losses and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Failure to adjust our orders for parts and subcomponents in an accurate and timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer acceptance of our products could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S6	Our earnings could be negatively affected and our inventory levels could materially increase if we are unable to predict our inventory needs in an accurate and timely manner and adjust our orders for parts and subcomponents should our needs increase or decrease materially due to unexpected increases or decreases in demand for our products.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S7	Any material increase in our inventories could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, while any material decrease in our ability to procure needed inventories could result in an inability to supply customer demand for our products, thus adversely affecting our revenues.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S8	Our ability to fulfill our backlog may have an effect on our long term ability to procure contracts and fulfill current contracts.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S9	Our ability to fulfill our backlog may be limited by our ability to devote sufficient financial and human capital resources and limited by available material supplies.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S10	If we do not fulfill our backlog in a timely manner, we may experience delays in product delivery, which would postpone receipt of revenue from those delayed deliveries.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S11	Additionally, if we are consistently unable to fulfill our backlog, this may be a disincentive to customers to award large contracts to us in the future until they are comfortable that we can effectively manage our backlog.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S12	We may choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves, and we may be unable to complete these acquisitions or may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired business in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S13	Our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S14	To this end, we have, from time to time, engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions, and from time to time acquiring one or more businesses, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S15	We may choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products, technologies and/or services instead of developing them ourselves.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S16	We may, however, face competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established companies with greater financial resources, making it more difficult for us to complete acquisitions.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S17	We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from one or more acquisitions that we consummate.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S18	Integrating any business, product, technology or service into our current operations could be expensive and time-consuming and/or disrupt our ongoing business.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S19	Further, there are numerous risks associated with acquisitions and potential acquisitions, including, but not limited to:
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	unexpected reduction of sales of existing products as a result of the introduction of new products.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on favorable terms, or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations, including as a result of our incurrence of indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We might need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings to finance any acquisition.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In that event, we could be forced to obtain financing on terms that are not favorable to us and, in the case of equity financing, that result in dilution to our stockholders.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	In addition, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, amortization of intangible assets, write-down of other assets or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions and purchase accounting could harm our business and operating results.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	If we cannot effectively manage growth, our business may suffer.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Over the long-term, we intend to grow our business by increasing our sales efforts and completing strategic acquisitions.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P31_S5	To effectively manage growth, we must, among other things:
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	administer appropriate financial and administrative control procedures.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Growth of our business will likely place a significant strain on our management, financial, operational, technical, sales and administrative resources.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Any failure to effectively manage our growth may cause our business to suffer and our stock price to decline.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Changes in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect results.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Our future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the (1) applicable tax laws; (2) composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates; or (3) recoverability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P34_S4	We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, released guidance covering various topics, including country-by-country reporting, definitional changes to permanent establishment and Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, or BEPS, an initiative that aims to standardize and modernize global tax policy.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Depending on the final form of guidance adopted by OECD members and legislation ultimately enacted, if any, there may be significant consequences for us due to our international business activities.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Turmoil or fluctuations in the credit markets and the financial services industry may negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In the past, global credit markets and the financial services industry have experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the tightening of the credit markets, the weakening of the global economy and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States and other governments.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Adverse economic conditions, such as sustained periods of economic uncertainty or a crisis in the financial markets may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition if our ability to obtain credit from the capital financial markets, or from trade creditors were to be impaired.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	either of which may negatively impact our business and results of operations.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Risks Related to the Semiconductor Industry Cyclicality in the semiconductor device industry has led to substantial decreases in demand for our systems and may from time to time continue to do so.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our operating results are subject to significant variation due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor device industry.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor device manufacturers, which, in turn, depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In recent years, the industry has experienced significant downturns, generally in connection with declines in economic conditions.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	This cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and, thus, future expense levels.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	During a down cycle, we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P41_S4	In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P41_S5	We can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P41_S6	If we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business could be seriously harmed.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P41_S7	Our future rate of growth is highly dependent on the development and growth of the market for microelectronic device inspection, lithography and metrology equipment.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P41_S8	We target our products to address the needs of microelectronic device manufacturers for defect inspection, metrology and lithography.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P41_S9	If for any reason the market for microelectronic device inspection, lithography or metrology equipment fails to grow in the long term, we may be unable to maintain current revenue levels in the short term and maintain our historical growth in the long term.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Growth in the inspection market is dependent to a large extent upon microelectronic manufacturers replacing manual inspection with automated inspection technology.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Growth in the metrology market is dependent to a large extent upon new chip designs and capacity expansion of microelectronic manufacturers.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Growth in the lithography market is dependent on the development of cost-effective packaging with high fine pitch RDLs, ultimately migrating to multi-die, large, form-factor packages.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P42_S3	There is no assurance that manufacturers will undertake these actions at the rate we expect.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Risks Related to our Stock Provisions of our charter documents and of Delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and/or delay, deter or prevent a change in control of our company.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P42_S5	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board of Directors.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P42_S6	These provisions also limit the circumstances in which a premium can be paid for our common stock and in which a proxy contest for control of our board may be initiated.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	the authority of our board, without stockholder approval, to adopt a stockholder rights plan.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Such a stockholder rights plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on June 27, 2005 and expired on June 28, 2015.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We are also entitled to avail ourselves of the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could inhibit changes in control of the Company.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our stock price is volatile .
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	The market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	From the beginning of 2013 through the end of 2017, our stock price fluctuated between a high of $28.10 per share and a low of $8.10 per share.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Factors affecting our stock price may include:
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	the number of firms making a market in our common stock.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	In addition, the stock market has experienced periods of significant price and volume fluctuations.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	These fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high technology companies like ours.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Any such market fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	There are various risks related to the legal and regulatory environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business that may expose us to risk.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	We are faced with various risks which may be associated with our compliance with existing, new, different, inconsistent or conflicting laws, regulations and rules enacted by governments and/or their regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate as well as rules and policies implemented at our customer sites.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	These laws, regulations, rules and policies could relate to any of an array of issues including, but not limited to, environmental, tax, intellectual property, trade secrets, product liability, contracts, antitrust, employment, securities, import/export and unfair competition.
1094392_18_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Should we fail to comply with or violate U.S. or foreign laws or regulations or customer policies, we could be subject to civil or criminal claims or proceedings that may result in monetary fines, penalties or other costs against us or our employees that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, customer relations and ability to conduct our business.
1094392_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal executive office building is located at 16 Jonspin Road in Wilmington, Massachusetts.
1094392_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own and lease facilities for corporate, engineering, manufacturing, sales and service related purposes in the United States and six other countries - China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Scotland.
1094392_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	The following table indicates the location, the general purpose and the square footage of our principal facilities.
1094392_18_ITEM2_P0_S3	The expiration years of the leases covering the leased facilities are also indicated.
1094392_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	We also lease office space for other smaller sales and service offices in several locations throughout the world.
1094392_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our existing facilities and capital equipment are adequate to meet our current requirements and that suitable additional or substitute space is available on commercially reasonable terms if needed.
1094392_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business.
1094392_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2017, there are no legal proceedings pending or threatened against us that management believes are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or otherwise.
1094392_18_ITEM3_P0_S2	Regarding litigation that was ongoing during 2017, on July 28, 2017, Rudolph and Camtek Ltd. ( Camtek ) entered into a Settlement Agreement (the Agreement ) resolving each of the three litigations referenced below (the Litigations ).

1094392_18_ITEM7_P1_S4	In addition, our advanced process control software portfolio includes powerful solutions for standalone tools, groups of tools, or factory-wide suites to enhance productivity and achieve significant cost savings.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Rudolph systems are backed by worldwide customer service and applications support.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Rudolph s business is affected by the annual spending patterns of our customers on semiconductor capital equipment.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	The amount that our customers devote to capital equipment spending depends on a number of factors, including general worldwide economic conditions as well as other economic drivers such as personal computer, tablet, cell phone, wearable devices, other personal electronic devices and automotive sales.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	Current forecasts by industry analysts for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry project capital equipment spending to be flat to down 1% for 2018.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our revenues and profitability tend to follow the trends of certain segments within the semiconductor market.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	Historically, a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers, and we expect this trend to continue.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, aggregate sales to customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for 27.2%, 34.5%, and 23.3% of our revenues, respectively.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P4_S3	We do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products, and they could cease purchasing products from us at any time.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P4_S4	A delay in purchase or cancellation by any of our large customers could cause quarterly revenues to vary significantly.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P4_S5	In addition, during a given quarter, a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P4_S6	The following table presents the average selling price range for our systems in 2017.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	A significant portion of our revenues is derived from customers outside of the United States.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	A substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in U.S dollars.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	We expect that revenues generated from customers outside of the United States will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P5_S3	The sales cycle for our systems typically ranges from six to twenty-four months and can be longer when our customers are evaluating new technology.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P5_S4	Due to the length of these cycles, we invest significantly in research and development and sales and marketing in advance of generating revenues related to these investments.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations as percentages of our revenues.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our results of operations are reported as one business segment.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	Results of Operations for 2017, 2016 and 2015 Revenues.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our revenues are derived from the sale of our systems, services, spare parts and software licensing.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	Our revenues were $255.1 million, $232.8 million and $221.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P7_S3	This represents an increase of 9.6% from 2016 to 2017 and an increase of 5.0% from 2015 to 2016.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P7_S4	The increase in revenues from 2016 to 2017 was due to a significant increase in capital spending by front-end memory manufacturers, as well as continued strength in capital spending by back-end foundry and Advanced Packaging customers in the OSAT markets.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P7_S5	The increase in revenues from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to increased capital spending by both the front-end and back-end semiconductor manufacturers, principally by our advanced packaging customers in the OSAT market.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P7_S6	The following table lists, for the periods indicated, the different sources of our revenues in dollars (thousands) and as percentages of our total revenues:
1094392_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Total systems and software revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to increased demand for our products in both front-end and back-end process control systems.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	The year-over-year increases in process control systems totaled $30.5 million, which was partially offset by decreases in lithography systems and software revenues of $4.7 million and $4.3 million, respectively.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	The increase in systems revenues was attributed to a greater number of process control units sold, which was partially offset by fewer lithography units sold.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P8_S3	Licensing revenues from software decreased $4.3 million primarily due to a decrease in revenues from our process control software.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P8_S4	The average selling price of similarly configured systems has been consistent and, therefore, did not have a material impact on our revenues for the same period.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P8_S5	Systems revenues generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to 70% of total revenues for 2017 compared to 72% of total revenues for 2016.

1094392_18_ITEM7_P10_S3	The average selling price of similarly configured systems has been consistent and, therefore, did not materially impact our revenues for the same period.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P10_S4	Systems revenues generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to 72% of total revenues for 2016 compared to 66% of total revenues for 2015.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P10_S5	The year-over-year increase in parts and services revenues in absolute dollars from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to increased spending by our customers on repairs of existing systems.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P10_S6	Parts and services revenues are generated from part sales, maintenance service contracts, system upgrades, as well as time and material billable service calls.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P10_S7	Deferred revenues of $6.2 million were recorded in Current liabilities and $1.0 million were recorded in Other non-current liabilities at December 31, 2017.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P10_S8	Deferred revenues primarily consisted of $4.7 million for deferred maintenance agreements and $2.5 million for outstanding deliverables.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P10_S9	At December 31, 2016, deferred revenues of $7.3 million were recorded in Current liabilities and $1.1 million were recorded in Other non-current liabilities.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P10_S10	Deferred maintenance agreements of $6.1 million and outstanding deliverables of $2.3 million were the two main components of deferred revenues at December 31, 2016.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P10_S11	Our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including manufacturing efficiencies, provision for excess and obsolete inventory, pricing by competitors or suppliers, new product introductions, production volume, customization and reconfiguration of systems, international and domestic sales mix, system and software product mix, and parts and services margins.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P10_S12	Our gross profit was $134.6 million, $123.6 million and $119.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P10_S13	The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to a change in our systems and software product sales mix.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P10_S14	The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to product mix.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P10_S15	Operating Expenses Our operating expenses consist of:
1094392_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	The process control defect inspection and metrology, advanced packaging lithography, and data analysis systems and software market is characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	We believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements of existing products, including the transition to copper and low-k dielectrics, wafer level packaging, the continuous shrinkage in critical dimensions, and the evolution of ultra-thin gate process control is critical to our success.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our technical, management and financial resources to research and development programs.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P11_S3	Research and development expenditures consist primarily of salaries and related expenses of employees engaged in research, design and development activities.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P11_S4	They also include consulting fees, the cost of related supplies and legal costs to defend our patents.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P11_S5	Our research and development expense was $47.0 million, $45.0 million and $41.2 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P11_S6	The year-over-year dollar increases from 2016 to 2017 as well as from 2015 to 2016 were primarily due to increased compensation and project costs.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P11_S7	We continue to maintain our commitment to investing in new product development and enhancement to existing products.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs for sales, marketing, and general administrative personnel, as well as commissions and other non-personnel related expenses.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	Our selling, general and administrative expense was $39.4 million, $38.6 million and $43.2 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	The year-over-year dollar increase from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	The year-over-year dollar decrease from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in share-based compensation costs.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Amortization of Identifiable Intangible Assets .
1094392_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	Amortization of identifiable intangible assets was $1.9 million, $2.3 million and $2.1 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	The year-over-year decrease in amortization expense from 2016 to 2017 was due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during these periods.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	amortization of intangibles for the acquisition of Stella Alliance, LLC, a Massachusetts-based semiconductor inspection technology intellectual property portfolio company, tha t occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we recorded income and received cash of $13.0 million from a comprehensive settlement regarding ongoing patent infringement Litigations with Camtek.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	We received $13.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and subsequently remitted $2.3 million of withholding tax to the Israel Tax Authority associated with the settlement and the prior year patent litigation judgment.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we recorded income and received cash from a patent litigation judgment of $14.6 million in conjunction with the final court ruling in the patent infringement litigation case against Camtek with the expiration of all opportunities to appeal.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	In 2017, net interest income was $1.0 million.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	In 2016 and 2015, net interest expense was $2.8 million and $5.7 million, respectively.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	The change in interest income (expense), net from 2015 to 2017, was primarily due to the redemption of the Senior Convertible Notes in July 2016.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P16_S3	The following table provides details of income tax (dollars in millions):
1094392_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	The income tax provision differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 35% for 2017 primarily due to new regulations resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Act ) of $9.5 million, offset by research and development credits of $1.6 million, section 199 manufacturing deduction of $1.6 million and excess tax benefits on vesting of restricted stock of $1.6 million.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the Tax Act, which significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, lowering the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time transition tax on foreign unremitted earnings.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	The lower U.S. corporate income tax rate is effective January 1, 2018, however the U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities were re-measured in 2017 when the new tax law was enacted.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	Additionally, in 2017, as part of the transition to the new territorial tax system, the Tax Act imposes a one-time tax on deemed repatriation of foreign subsidiaries earnings.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	At December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act, however, we have made reasonable estimates of the effects.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	The provisional impact of the Tax Act summarized below, which is included as a component of the provision from income taxes is further described in Note 11 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars in millions ).
1094392_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	We are continuing to assess the impact from the Tax Act and may record adjustments in 2018 as additional analysis is completed and as we gain a more thorough understanding of the tax law.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	The income tax provision differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 35% for 2016, primarily due to research and development credits of $0.7 million, section 199 manufacturing deduction of $1.2 million, the foreign taxes net of federal benefit of $1.6 million and deferred tax true-ups of $1.7 million from prior periods.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	The income tax provision differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 35% for 2015, primarily due to research and development credits, section 199 manufacturing deduction and a decrease in our valuation allowance, partially offset by taxes accrued in foreign jurisdictions.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as future impacts of the Tax Act, new tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activi ties fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income .
1094392_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2017, we had $177.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $279.8 million in working capital.

1094392_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2015, financing activities primarily included the purchase of shares under the share repurchase authorization of $20.7 million and tax payments related to shares withheld for share based compensation plans.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	From time to time we evaluate whether to acquire new or complementary businesses, products and/or technologies.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	We may fund all or a portion of the purchase price of these acquisitions in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	In January 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 3.0 million shares of the Company s common stock with no established end date.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	The authorization allows for repurchases to be made in the open market or through negotiated transactions from time to time.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	At December 31, 2017, there were 0.7 million shares available for future stock repurchases under this repurchase authorization.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	Shares of common stock purchased under the share repurchase authorization are retired.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P27_S3	For further information, see Note 15 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	We have a credit agreement with a bank that provides for a line of credit that is secured by the marketable securities we have with the bank.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	We are permitted to borrow up to 70% of the value of eligible securities held at the time the line of credit is accessed.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	As of December 31, 2017, the available line of credit was approximately $87.6 million with an available interest rate of 3.0%.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	The credit agreement is available to us until such time that either party terminates the arrangement at their discretion.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P28_S4	To date, we have not utilized the line of credit.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P28_S5	Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and amount of our revenues and our investment decisions, which will affect our ability to generate additional cash.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P28_S6	We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs for the next twelve months.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P28_S7	Thereafter, if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements, we may seek additional funding through bank borrowings, sales of securities or other means.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P28_S8	There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us or at all.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P28_S9	The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2017, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P28_S10	This table excludes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits that totaled approximately $4.9 million at December 31, 2017.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P28_S11	We are currently unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount or periods when cash settlement of this liability may occur.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company does not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity and capital resources.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Critical Accounting Policies Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	We review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P30_S3	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, business acquisitions, intangible assets, share-based payments, income taxes and warranty obligations.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from oth er sources.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	Results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P31_S2	These estimates and judgments are regularly reviewed by management on an ongoing basis at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P31_S3	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Revenues are recognized, provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	Revenue recognition generally results at the following points: (1) for all transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon shipment, revenues are recognized upon shipment for all products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment; the portion of revenues associated with certain installation-related tasks is deferred, and more revenues are recognized upon completion of the installation-related tasks; (2) for products that have not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment, revenues are recognized at customer technical acceptance; (3) for transactions with multiple elements, such as sales of products that include software and services, the revenues relating to the undelivered elements are deferred using the relative selling price method utilizing vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) or estimated sales prices ( ESP ) until delivery of the deferred elements.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Third-party evidence is not typically used to determine selling prices as to limited availability of reliable competitor products selling prices.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	The ESP is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, gross margin objectives, internal costs and competitor pricing strategies.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Revenues from parts sales are recognized at the time of shipment.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	Revenues from training and service contracts are recognized ratably over the training period and contract period.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	A provision for the estimated cost of fulfilling warranty obligations is recorded at the time the related revenues are recognized.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P35_S3	Revenues from software license fees are recognized upon shipment or customer acknowledgment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and VSOE exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P35_S4	License support and maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the contract period.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P35_S5	Deferred revenue represents undelivered items, prepaid service contract revenues and prepaid license support and maintenance revenues.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P35_S6	Deferred revenue is recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policies described above.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	We specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if our assumptions are otherwise incorrect, additional allowances may be required.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P36_S3	We maintain reserves for our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product life-cycles, product demand and market conditions.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P36_S4	If actual product life-cycles, product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those originally projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	We account for acquired or merged businesses using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition or merger at their respective fair values.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	Accordingly, for significant acquisitions, we typically obtain assistance from independent valuation specialists.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	There are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	For intangible assets, we typically utilize the income method.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the projected future cash flows (including timing) and the discount rate reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flows.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	All of these judgments and estimates can significantly impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	Our formal annual impairment testing date for goodwill is October 31 st or prior to the next annual testing date if an event occurs or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	If we elect this option and, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	We have not elected this option to date.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process that requires us to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	The first step consists of estimating the fair value of our aggregated reporting unit using the market value of our common stock at October 31 st , multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares (market capitalization) and an implied control premium as if it were to be acquired by a single stockholder.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P44_S2	We obtain information on completed sales of similar companies in a comparable industry to estimate an implied control premium for us.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P44_S3	We compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, which includes goodwill.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P44_S4	If the results of the initial market capitalization test produce results that are below the reporting unit carrying value, we will also consider if the market capitalization is temporarily low and, if so, we may also perform a discounted cash flow test.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, then the second step, calculating the goodwill impairment amount, must be performed.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	The goodwill impairment amount is calculated by determining the implied fair value of goodwill.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P45_S2	This determination requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P45_S3	Any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill, which is compared to the corresponding carrying value to calculate the goodwill impairment amount.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	We are not required to perform the second step during our annual impairment test.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	Long-Lived Assets and Acquired Intangible Assets.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	We periodically review long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and the impairment of such long-lived assets, if any, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	No such indicators were noted in 2017.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	While we engage in product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P50_S3	Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	The need for a valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred taxes will be recoverable.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, we may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had valuation allowances of $2.4 million and $1.9 million on certain of our deferred tax assets to reflect, the deferred tax assets at the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P51_S3	We evaluated the realizability of the deferred tax assets based on positive earnings from 2015 through 2017 as well as the projected earnings in future years and believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized in the future years.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P51_S4	We will continue to monitor the realizability of the deferred tax assets and evaluate the valuation allowance.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	The first step requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that the tax position has met the threshold for recognition; therefore, we must evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P52_S2	The second step requires us to measure the tax benefit of the tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized when effectively settled.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P52_S3	This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P52_S4	We reevaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues, and new audit activity.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	Although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P53_S2	If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, it could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncem ents Recently Adopted Effective January 1, 2017, we adopted FASB Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	The standard update simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory withholding requirements, as well as the classification in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	As a result of the adoption, on a prospective basis, we recognized $1.6 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation as a benefit in our income tax provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	Historically, these amounts were recorded as additional paid-in capital.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	Upon adoption, we elected to present excess tax benefits to operating cash flows retrospectively to our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, which resulted in a reclassification of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $0.8 million from cash flows from financing activities to cash flows from operating activities.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	We elected to change our policy on accounting for forfeitures and account for forfeitures as they occur.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P56_S3	As a result of the forfeiture rate policy change, we recorded a reduction to retained earnings of $72 thousand under the modified retrospective approach.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P56_S4	Additional amendments to the accounting for income taxes and minimum statutory withholding requirements had no impact on our results of operations.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	Effective January 1, 2017, we adopted ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	This simplifies subsequent measurement of inventory by having an entity measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal, and transportation.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	The adoption of ASU 2015-11 did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	Recently Issued In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic718): Scope of Modification Accounting.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	This ASU amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements and provides guidance on the types of changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards to which an entity would be required to apply modification accounting under ASC 718.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P60_S3	We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU No. 2017-09 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	This ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	Accordingly, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU No. 2017-04 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Tax (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	This ASU, which is part of the Board s simplification initiative, is intended to reduce the complexity of U.S. GAAP and diversity in practice related to the tax consequences of certain types of intra-entity asset transfers, particularly those involving intellectual property.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P63_S3	We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU No. 2016-16 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	This ASU provides guidance on statement of cash flows presentation for eight specific cash flow issues where diversity in practice exists.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P65_S2	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), which introduces new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on instruments within its scope.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P65_S3	Given the breadth of that scope, the new ASU will impact both financial services and non-financial services entities.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P65_S4	The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P65_S5	We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P65_S6	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).
1094392_18_ITEM7_P65_S7	This ASU requires that lessees will be required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P65_S8	ASU No. 2016-02 also will require disclosures designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P65_S9	These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative information.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P65_S10	This ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018 with earlier adoption permitted.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	We are in the process of evaluating the effects that the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	I n May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	The core principle of Topic 606 is that revenues should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P67_S2	In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the standard by one year.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P67_S3	Consequently, Topic 606 became effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P67_S4	In addition, the FASB issued subsequent guidance on certain items such as reporting revenue as a principal versus agent, identifying performance obligations, accounting for intellectual property licenses, assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes, impairment testing for contract costs, disclosure of performance obligations, and provided additional implementation guidance.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P67_S5	We adopted the new standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P67_S6	We are substantially complete with our initial assessment of the effect of adoption and believe the impact of the new standard on the amount and timing of revenue recognition will not be material to our financial position or results of operations.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P67_S7	The new standard will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from customer contracts, including judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.
1094392_18_ITEM7_P67_S8	We will update certain disclosures, as applicable, included in our financial statements to meet the requirements of the new guidance.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Interest Rate and Credit Market Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates and market liquidity including our investments in certain available-for-sale securities.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our available-for-sale securities consist of fixed and variable rate income investments (municipal notes, municipal bonds and corporate bonds).
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates, market liquidity and credit ratings of issuers for our available-for-sale securities.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P1_S3	It is possible that we are at risk if interest rates, market liquidity or credit ratings of issuers change in an unfavorable direction.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P1_S4	The magnitude of any gain or loss will be a function of the difference between the fixed or variable rate of the financial instrument and the market rate, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our financial investments held as of December 31, 2017, an immediate adverse change of 10% in interest rates (e.g. 3.00% to 3.30%) would result in an immaterial decrease in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities and would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Foreign Currency Risk A substantial portion of our systems and software sales are denominated in U.S. dollars with the exception of Japan.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Consequently, we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these sales.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Substantially all of our sales in Japan are denominated in Japanese yen.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	From time to time, we may enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within 12 months.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The change in fair value of the forward contracts is recognized in Other (income) expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for each reporting period.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had thirty-one and nineteen outstanding forward contracts with a total notional contract value of $8.4 million and $3.8 million, respectively.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P5_S1	We have branch operations in Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea and wholly-owned subsidiaries in Europe, Japan and China.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Our international subsidiaries and branches operate primarily using local functional currencies.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P5_S3	Our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arise from intercompany balances between our U.S. headquarters and that of our foreign owned entities.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P5_S4	Our intercompany balances are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Since each foreign entity's functional currency is generally denominated in its local currency, there is exposure to foreign exchange risk when the foreign entity s intercompany balance is remeasured at a reporting date, resulting in transaction gains or losses.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The intercompany balance, exposed to foreign currency risk, as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $39.9 million.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P6_S2	A hypothetical change of 10% in the relative value of the U.S. dollar versus local functional currencies could result in approximately $1.4 million in foreign currency exchange losses / (gains) which would be recorded as non-operating expense in other expense (income) in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1094392_18_ITEM7A_P7_S0	We cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and consolidated financial position.
1094392_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	The consolidated financial statements and related information required by this item are set forth on the pages indicated in Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1094392_18_ITEM9_P0_S0	Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
1094392_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in SEC rules and forms.
1094392_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	These controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1094392_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, we have recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1094392_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management is required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures.
1094392_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	We performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, to assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2017.
1094392_18_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Based on that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2017 at the reasonable assurance level.
1094392_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).

1094392_18_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1094392_18_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1094392_18_ITEM15_P11_S9	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P12_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P12_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P12_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

1094392_18_ITEM15_P18_S4	Third-party evidence is not typically used to determine selling prices as to limited availability of reliable competitor products selling prices.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P19_S0	The ESP is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, gross margin objectives, internal costs and competitor pricing strategies.

1094392_18_ITEM15_P21_S0	C. Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P22_S0	of goodwill, recoverability of deferred tax assets, liabilities for product warranty, contingencies, including litigation res erves and share-based payments and liabilities for tax uncertainties.

1094392_18_ITEM15_P25_S0	The Company reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P25_S1	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, credit quality and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P25_S2	When a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities are charged against earnings.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P26_S0	The specific identification method is used to determine the gains and losses on marketable securities.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P26_S1	For additional information on the Company s marketable securities, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P27_S0	F. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P27_S1	Where the Company is aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligation, the Company records a specific allowance against amounts due, thereby reducing the net recognized receivable to the amount management reasonably believes will be collected.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P27_S2	For all other customers, the Company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are outstanding, industry and geographic concentrations, the current business environment and historical experience.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P28_S0	G. Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P28_S1	Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P28_S2	Cost is generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis, and includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P28_S3	The Company reviews and sets standard costs as needed, but at a minimum on an annual basis, at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs.

1094392_18_ITEM15_P28_S5	The Company establishes inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon assumptions about historical and future demand for the Company s products and market conditions.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P28_S6	In addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering design changes.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P29_S0	Once a reserve has been established, it is maintained until the item to which it relates is scrapped or sold.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P30_S0	H. Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P30_S1	Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are fifteen years for buildings, four to seven years for machinery and equipment, seven years for furniture and fixtures, and three years for computer equipment.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P31_S0	improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related asset.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P31_S1	Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and major renewals and betterments are capitalized .
1094392_18_ITEM15_P32_S0	I. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and identifiable acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P33_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P33_S1	If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is generally based on discounted cash flows.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P34_S0	J. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P34_S1	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually and when there are indications of impairment.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P35_S0	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P35_S1	The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P35_S2	If, the Company elects this option and after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is not likely that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P35_S3	The Company has not elected this option to date.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P36_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting unit using the market value of its common stock at October 31 st multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares (market capitalization) and an implied control premium as if it were to be acquired by a single stockholder.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P36_S1	The Company also obtains information on completed sales of similar companies in the related industry to estimate the implied control premium for the Company.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P36_S2	If the results of the initial market capitalization test produce results that are below the reporting unit carrying value, the Company will also consider if the market capitalization is temporarily low and, if so, we may also perform a discounted cash flow test.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P37_S0	The Company tested for goodwill impairment on October 31, 2017.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P37_S1	For additional information on the Company s goodwill and purchased intangible assets, see Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

1094392_18_ITEM15_P38_S2	The Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P38_S3	The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities with higher credit quality issuers and monitors the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.

1094392_18_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P40_S0	M. Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach for deferred taxes which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company s consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P41_S0	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce a deferred tax asset to that portion which more likely than not will be realized.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P42_S0	on the undistributed earnings of its foreign operations as it is the Company s intention to permanently re-inves t undistributed earnings.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P43_S0	The impact of an uncertain income tax position is recognized as the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority and includes consideration of interest and penalties.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P43_S1	An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P44_S0	The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified as non-current as the Company early adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current.

1094392_18_ITEM15_P50_S0	Certain software product development costs incurred after technological feasibility has been established are capitalized and amortized, commencing upon the general release of the software product to the Company s customers, over the economic life of the software product.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P50_S1	Annual amortization of capitalized costs is computed using the greater of: (i) the ratio of current gross revenues for the software product over the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for the software product or (ii) the straight-line basis, typically over seven years.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P50_S2	Software product development costs incurred prior to the product reaching technological feasibility are expensed as incurred and included in research and development costs.

1094392_18_ITEM15_P51_S1	R. Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P51_S2	The estimated fair value of these obligations is based, primarily, on a market approach, comparing the Company s interest rates to those rates the Company believes it would reasonably receive upon re-entry into the market.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P51_S3	Judgment is required to estimate the fair value using available market information and appropriate valuation methods.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P51_S4	For additional information on the Company s fair value of financial instruments, see Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P52_S0	S. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities: The Company, when it considers it to be appropriate, enters into forward contracts to hedge the economic exposures arising from foreign currency denominated transactions.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P52_S1	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, these contracts included the future sale of Japanese Yen to purchase U.S. dollars.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P52_S2	The foreign currency forward contracts were entered into by the Company s Japanese subsidiary to hedge a portion of certain intercompany obligations.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P52_S3	The forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and therefore, the change in fair value is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P52_S4	The Company records its forward contracts at fair value in either prepaid expenses and other current assets or other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

1094392_18_ITEM15_P57_S3	o f Cash Flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, which resulted in a reclassification of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $792 and $16, respectively, from cash flows from financing activities to cash flows from opera ting activities.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P57_S4	The Company elected to change its policy on accounting for forfeitures and account for forfeitures as they occur.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P57_S5	As a result of the forfeiture rate policy change, the Company recorded a reduction to retained earnings of $72 under the mo dified retrospective approach.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P57_S6	Additional amendments to the accounting for income taxes and minimum statutory withholding requirements had no impact on its results of operations.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P58_S0	Effective January 1, 2017, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P58_S1	This simplifies subsequent measurement of inventory by having an entity measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P59_S0	Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal, and transportation.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P60_S0	The adoption of ASU 2015-11 did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P61_S0	Recently Issued In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic718): Scope of Modification Accounting.

1094392_18_ITEM15_P61_S5	This ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P61_S6	Accordingly, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P62_S0	The ASU is effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P62_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU No. 2017-04 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

1094392_18_ITEM15_P62_S5	The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU No. 2016-16 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P63_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P63_S1	This ASU provides guidance on statement of cash flows presentation for eight specific cash flow issues where diversity in practice exists.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P63_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P63_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P63_S4	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), which introduces new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on instruments within its scope.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P63_S5	Given the breadth of that scope, the new ASU will impact both financial services and non-financial services entities.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P63_S6	The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P63_S7	The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P64_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).

1094392_18_ITEM15_P65_S0	Th is ASU is effective for annual per iods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018 with earlier adoption permitted.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P65_S1	The Company is in the process of evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial po sition, results of operations, and cash flows.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P66_S0	I n May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P66_S1	The core principle of Topic 606 is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P66_S2	In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the standard by one year.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P66_S3	Consequently, Topic 606 became effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P66_S4	In addition, the FASB issued subsequent guidance on certain items such as reporting revenue as a principal versus agent, identifying performance obligations, accounting for intellectual property licenses, assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes, impairment testing for contract costs, disclosure of performance obligations, and provided additional implementation guidance.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P66_S5	The Company will adopt the new standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P66_S6	The Company is substantially complete with its initial assessment of the effect of adoption and believes the impact of the new standard on the amount and timing of revenue recognition will not be material to its financial position or result of operations.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P66_S7	The new standard will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from customer contracts, including judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P66_S8	The Company will update certain disclosures, as applicable, included in its financial statements to meet the requirements of the new guidance.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P67_S0	The Company applies a three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurements.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P67_S1	This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P68_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P68_S1	Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P68_S2	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management s assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P69_S0	A financial asset s or liability s fair value measurement classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P70_S0	The following tables provide the a ssets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:
1094392_18_ITEM15_P71_S0	The Company s investments classified as Level 1 are based on quoted market prices that are available in active markets.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P71_S1	The Company s investments classified as Level 2 are valued using observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P72_S0	The foreign currency forward contracts are primarily measured based on the foreign currency spot and forward rates quoted by the banks or foreign currency dealers.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P73_S0	Investment prices are obtained from third party pricing providers, which model prices utilizing the above observable inputs, for each asset class.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P74_S0	Level 3 investments consisted of contingent consideration related to an acquisition for which the Company uses a discounted cash flow model to value these investments.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P74_S1	The Level 3 assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for the contingent consideration included projected revenues, timing of cash flows and estimates of discount rates of 8.6% and 9.1% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P74_S2	A significant decrease in the projected revenues or increase in discount rates could result in a significantly lower fair value measurement for the contingent consideration.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P75_S0	This table presents a reconciliation o f all liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the year ended December 31, 2017:
1094392_18_ITEM15_P76_S0	See Note 4 for additional discussion regarding the fair value of the Company s marketable securities.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P76_S1	The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P76_S2	The estimated fair value of these obligations is based, primarily, on a market approach, comparing the Company s interest rates to those rates the Company believes it would reasonably receive upon re-entry into the market.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P76_S3	Judgment is required to estimate the fair value using available market information and appropriate valuation methods.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P77_S0	The Company has evaluated its investment policies and determined that all of its investment securities are to be classified as available-for-sale.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P77_S1	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported in Stockholders Equity under the caption Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P77_S2	Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in Other expense (income).
1094392_18_ITEM15_P77_S3	The Company records other-than-temporary impairment charges for its available-for-sale investments when it intends to sell the securities, it is more-likely-than not that it will be required to sell the securities before a recovery, or when it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the securities.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P78_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P79_S0	The Company has determined that the gross unrealized losses on its marketable securities at December 31, 2017 and 2016 are temporary in nature.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P79_S1	The Company reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P79_S2	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, credit quality and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P80_S0	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, marketable securities are categorized as follows:
1094392_18_ITEM15_P81_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable securities classified by the maturity date listed on the security, regardless of the Consolidated Balance Sheet classification, is as follows at December 31, 2017 and 2016:
1094392_18_ITEM15_P82_S0	The following table summarizes the estimated fair value and gross unrealized holding losses of marketable securities, aggregated by investment instrument and period of time in an unrealized loss position, at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P83_S0	See Note 3 for additional discussion regarding the fair value of the Company s marketable securities.

1094392_18_ITEM15_P127_S0	On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Act ).
1094392_18_ITEM15_P127_S1	The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that affected 2017, including, but not limited to, (1) requiring a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is payable over eight years and (2) bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P127_S2	The Tax Act also establishes new tax laws that will affect 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate; (2) the creation of the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse ( BEAT ), a new minimum tax; (3) a general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) a new provision designed to tax Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ( GILTI ), which allows for the possibility of using FTCs and a deduction of up to 50 percent to offset the income tax liability (subject to some limitations); (5) the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction; (6) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; and (7) limitations on the use of FTCs to reduce the U.S. income tax liability.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P128_S0	Given the complexity of the 2018 Tax Act provisions identified above, we are still evaluating the effects and have not yet determined what, if any, accounting policies will need to change, nor have we calculated the impact of the above provisions.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P129_S0	At December 31, 2017 the Company has not completed its accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act, however, the Company was able to make reasonable estimates of certain effects and, therefore, recorded provisional adjustments as follows:
1094392_18_ITEM15_P130_S0	Reduction of U.S. federal corporate tax rate: The Tax Act reduces the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P130_S1	For certain of its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, the Company has recorded a provisional decrease of $8.0 million, respectively, with a corresponding net adjustment to deferred income tax expense of $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P130_S2	While the Company is able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction in corporate rate, it may be affected by other analyses related to the Tax Act, including, but not limited to, its calculation of deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P131_S0	Transition tax: The transition tax is a tax on previously deferred earnings and profits ( E P ) of certain of its foreign subsidiaries.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P131_S1	To determine the amount of the transition tax, the Company must determine, in addition to other factors, the amount of post-1986 E P of the relevant subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P131_S2	The Company is able to make a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and recorded a provisional transition tax obligation of $1.5 million with a corresponding adjustment to current income tax expense.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P132_S0	benefit of $1. 5 million .
1094392_18_ITEM15_P132_S1	However, the Company is continuing to gather addit ional information to more preci sely compute the amount of the transition t ax and foreign tax credit .
1094392_18_ITEM15_P133_S0	Valuation allowances: The Company must assess whether its valuation allowance analyses are affected by various aspects of the Tax Act.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P133_S1	Since, as discussed herein, the Company has recorded provisional amounts related to certain portions of the Tax Act, any corresponding determination of the need for or change in a valuation allowance is also provisional.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P133_S2	The Company concluded that with all the facts that are available at this point in time that that a full valuation allowance on all carry forward foreign tax credits were needed.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P133_S3	The Company recorded the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017 in the amount of $1.5 million with a corresponding adjustment to current income tax expense.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P134_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised of the following:
1094392_18_ITEM15_P135_S0	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had valuation allowances of $2,447 and $1,924, respectively, on certain of the Company s deferred tax assets to reflect the deferred tax assets at the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P135_S1	The Company recorded a full valuation allowance on all foreign tax credits as of December 31, 2017 in the amount of $1,542, offset by reversal of valuation allowance against expired state research and developments credits in the amount of $741 and the reversal of a prior valuation allowance based on current year utilization in the amount of $278.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P136_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company uses a more likely than not standard.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P136_S1	If it is determined that it is more-likely-than-not that deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against the deferred tax assets.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P137_S0	The ultimate realization of the assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences become deductible.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P137_S1	Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies when making this assessment.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P137_S2	In making the determination that it is more likely than not that the Company s deferred tax assets will be realized as of December 31, 2017, the Company relied primarily on projected future taxable income.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P137_S3	At December 31, 2017, the Company had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $591, $171 and $1,134, respectively.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P137_S4	The federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards expire on various dates through December 31, 2032, December 31, 2032 and December 31, 2026, respectively.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P137_S5	At December 31, 2017, the Company had federal and state research development credits and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $118, $318 and $1,542, respectively.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P137_S6	The federal research development credits are set to expire at December 31, 2037.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P137_S7	The state research development credits are set to expire at various dates through December 21, 2024.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P138_S0	A provision has not been made at December 31, 2017 for U.S. or additional foreign withholding taxes on approximately $7,663 of undistributed ea rnings not subject to the transition tax of the Company s foreign subsidiaries in Europe and Japan nor on any additional outside basis differences inherent in these entitites because it is the present intention of management to permanently reinvest these undistributed earnings.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P139_S0	It is not practical to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be re patriated .
1094392_18_ITEM15_P139_S1	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits are as follows:
1094392_18_ITEM15_P140_S0	Included in the ending balance at December 31, 2017 and 2016 are unrecognized tax benefits of $4,403 and $4,275, respectively, which would be reflected as an adjustment to income tax expense if recognized.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P140_S1	The year over year increase from 2016 to 2017 is primarily due to additional unrecognized tax benefits related to federal tax exposures.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P140_S2	It is reasonably possible that certain amounts of unrecognized tax benefits may reverse in the next 12 months; however, the Company does not expect such reversals to have a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position.
1094392_18_ITEM15_P140_S3	The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
